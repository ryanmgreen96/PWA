      As every      enquiry, which regards religion, is of the utmost importance, there are two questions in particular, which challenge our attention, to wit, that concerning its foundation in reason, and that concerning its origin in human nature. Happily, the first question, which is the most important, admits of the most obvious, at least, the clearest solution. The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intelligent author; and no rational enquirer can, after serious reflection, suspend his belief a moment with regard to the primary principles of genuine Theism and Religion. But the other question, concerning the origin of religion in human nature, is exposed to some more difficulty. The belief of invisible, intelligent power has been very generally diffused over the human race, in all places and in all ages; but it has neither perhaps been so universal as to admit of no exception, nor has it been, in any degree, uniform in the ideas, which it has suggested. Some nations have been discovered, who entertained no sentiments of Religion, if travellers and historians may be credited; and no two nations, and scarce any two men, have ever agreed precisely in the same sentiments. It would appear, therefore, that this preconception springs not from an original instinct or primary impression of nature, such as gives rise to self-love, affection between the sexes, love of progeny, gratitude, resentment; since every instinct of this kind has been found absolutely universal in all nations and ages, and has always a precise determinate object, which it inflexibly pursues. The first religious principles must be secondary; such as may easily be perverted by various accidents and causes, and whose operation too, in some cases, may, by an extraordinary concurrence of circumstances, be altogether prevented. What those principles are, which give rise to the original belief, and what those accidents and causes are, which direct its operation, is the subject of our present enquiry.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="PolytheismprimaryReligion">
      It appears to me, that, if we consider the improvement of human society, from rude beginnings to a state of greater perfection, polytheism or idolatry was, and necessarily must have been, the first and most ancient religion of mankind. This opinion I shall endeavour to confirm by the following arguments.
      <br>&emsp;It is a matter of fact incontestable, that about 1700 years ago all mankind were polytheists. The doubtful and sceptical principles of a few philosophers, or the theism, and that too not entirely pure, of one or two nations, form no objection worth regarding. Behold then the clear testimony of history. The farther we mount up into antiquity, the more do we find mankind plunged into polytheism. No marks, no symptoms of any more perfect religion. The most ancient records of human race still present us with that system as the popular and established creed. The north, the south, the east, the west, give their unanimous testimony to the same fact. What can be opposed to so full an evidence?
      <br>&emsp;As far as writing or history reaches, mankind, in ancient times, appear universally to have been polytheists. Shall we assert, that, in more ancient times, before the knowledge of letters, or the discovery of any art or science, men entertained the principles of pure theism? That is, while they were ignorant and barbarous, they discovered truth: But fell into error, as soon as they acquired learning and politeness.
      <br>&emsp;But in this assertion you not only contradict all appearance of probability, but also our present experience concerning the principles and opinions of barbarous nations. The savage tribes of America, Africa, and Asia are all idolaters. Not a single exception to this rule. Insomuch, that, were a traveller to transport himself into any unknown region; if he found inhabitants cultivated with arts and science, though even upon that supposition there are odds against their being theists, yet could he not safely, till farther inquiry, pronounce any thing on that head: But if he found them ignorant and barbarous, he might beforehand declare them idolaters; and there scarcely is a possibility of his being mistaken.
      <br>&emsp;It seems certain, that, according to the natural progress of human thought, the ignorant multitude must first entertain some groveling and familiar notion of superior powers, before they stretch their conception to that perfect Being, who bestowed order on the whole frame of nature. We may as reasonably imagine, that men inhabited palaces before huts and cottages, or studied geometry before agriculture; as assert that the Deity appeared to them a pure spirit, omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, before he was apprehended to be a powerful, though limited being, with human passions and appetites, limbs and organs. The mind rises gradually, from inferior to superior: By abstracting from what is imperfect, it forms an idea of perfection: And slowly distinguishing the nobler parts of its own frame from the grosser, it learns to transfer only the former, much elevated and refined, to its divinity. Nothing could disturb this natural progress of thought, but some obvious and invincible argument, which might immediately lead the mind into the pure principles of theism, and make it overleap, at one bound, the vast interval which is interposed between the human and the divine nature. But though I allow, that the order and frame of the universe, when accurately examined, affords such an argument; yet I can never think, that this consideration could have an influence on mankind, when they formed their first rude notions of religion.
      <br>&emsp;The causes of such objects, as are quite familiar to us, never strike our attention or curiosity; and however extraordinary or surprising these objects in themselves, they are passed over, by the raw and ignorant multitude, without much examination or enquiry. Adam, rising at once, in paradise, and in the full perfection of his faculties, would naturally, as represented by Milton, be astonished at the glorious appearances of nature, the heavens, the air, the earth, his own organs and members; and would be led to ask, whence this wonderful scene arose. But a barbarous, necessitous animal (such as a man is on the first origin of society), pressed by such numerous wants and passions, has no leisure to admire the regular face of nature, or make enquiries concerning the cause of those objects, to which from his infancy he has been gradually accustomed. On the contrary, the more regular and uniform, that is, the more perfect nature appears, the more is he familiarized to it, and the less inclined to scrutinize and examine it. A monstrous birth excites his curiosity, and is deemed a prodigy. It alarms him from its novelty; and immediately sets him a trembling, and sacrificing, and praying. But an animal, compleat in all its limbs and organs, is to him an ordinary spectacle, and produces no religious opinion or affection. Ask him, whence that animal arose; he will tell you, from the copulation of its parents. And these, whence? From the copulation of theirs. A few removes satisfy his curiosity, and set the objects at such a distance, that he entirely loses sight of them. Imagine not, that he will so much as start the question, whence the first animal; much less, whence the whole system or united fabric of the universe arose. Or, if you start such a question to him, expect not, that he will employ his mind with any anxiety about a subject, so remote, so uninteresting, and which so much exceeds the bounds of his capacity.
      <br>&emsp;But farther, if men were at first led into the belief of one Supreme Being, by reasoning from the frame of nature, they could never possibly leave that belief, in order to embrace polytheism; but the same principles of reason, which at first produced and diffused over mankind, so magnificent an opinion, must be able, with greater facility, to preserve it. The first invention and proof of any doctrine is much more difficult than the supporting and retaining of it.
      <br>&emsp;There is a great difference between historical facts and speculative opinions; nor is the knowledge of the one propagated in the same manner with that of the other. An historical fact, while it passes by oral tradition from eye-witnesses and contemporaries, is disguised in every successive narration, and may at last retain but very small, if any, resemblance of the original truth, on which it was founded. The frail memories of men, their love of exaggeration, their supine carelessness; these principles, if not corrected by books and writing, soon pervert the account of historical events; where argument or reasoning has little or no place, nor can ever recal the truth, which has once escaped those narrations. It is thus the fables of Hercules, Theseus, Bacchus are supposed to have been originally founded in true history, corrupted by tradition. But with regard to speculative opinions, the case is far otherwise. If these opinions be founded on arguments so clear and obvious as to carry conviction with the generality of mankind, the same arguments, which at first diffused the opinions, will still preserve them in their original purity. If the arguments be more abstruse, and more remote from vulgar apprehension, the opinions will always be confined to a few persons; and as soon as men leave the contemplation of the arguments, the opinions will immediately be lost and be buried in oblivion. Whichever side of this dilemma we take, it must appear impossible, that theism could, from reasoning, have been the primary religion of human race, and have afterwards, by its corruption, given birth to polytheism and to all the various superstitions of the heathen world. Reason, when obvious, prevents these corruptions: When abstruse, it keeps the principles entirely from the knowledge of the vulgar, who are alone liable to corrupt any principle or opinion.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="OriginPolytheism">
      If we would, therefore, indulge our curiosity, in enquiring concerning the origin of religion, we must turn our thoughts towards polytheism, the primitive religion of uninstructed mankind.
      <br>&emsp;Were men led into the apprehension of invisible, intelligent power by a contemplation of the works of nature, they could never possibly entertain any conception but of one single being, who bestowed existence and order on this vast machine, and adjusted all its parts, according to one regular plan or connected system. For though, to persons of a certain turn of mind, it may not appear altogether absurd, that several independent beings, endowed with superior wisdom, might conspire in the contrivance and execution of one regular plan; yet is this a merely arbitrary supposition, which, even if allowed possible, must be confessed neither to be supported by probability nor necessity. All things in the universe are evidently of a piece. Every thing is adjusted to every thing. One design prevails throughout the whole. And this uniformity leads the mind to acknowledge one author; because the conception of different authors, without any distinction of attributes or operations, serves only to give perplexity to the imagination, without bestowing any satisfaction on the understanding. The statue of Laocoon, as we learn from Pliny, was the work of three artists: But it is certain, that, were we not told so, we should never have imagined, that a groupe of figures, cut from one stone, and united in one plan, was not the work and contrivance of one statuary. To ascribe any single effect to the combination of several causes, is not surely a natural and obvious supposition.
      <br>&emsp;On the other hand, if, leaving the works of nature, we trace the footsteps of invisible power in the various and contrary events of human life, we are necessarily led into polytheism and to the acknowledgment of several limited and imperfect deities. Storms and tempests ruin what is nourished by the sun. The sun destroys what is fostered by the moisture of dews and rains. War may be favourable to a nation, whom the inclemency of the seasons afflicts with famine. Sickness and pestilence may depopulate a kingdom, amidst the most profuse plenty. The same nation is not, at the same time, equally successful by sea and by land. And a nation, which now triumphs over its enemies, may anon submit to their more prosperous arms. In short, the conduct of events, or what we call the plan of a particular providence, is so full of variety and uncertainty, that, if we suppose it immediately ordered by any intelligent beings, we must acknowledge a contrariety in their designs and intentions, a constant combat of opposite powers, and a repentance or change of intention in the same power, from impotence or levity. Each nation has its tutelar deity. Each element is subjected to its invisible power or agent. The province of each god is separate from that of another. Nor are the operations of the same god always certain and invariable. To-day he protects: To-morrow he abandons us. Prayers and sacrifices, rites and ceremonies, well or ill performed, are the sources of his favour or enmity, and produce all the good or ill fortune, which are to be found amongst mankind.
      <br>&emsp;We may conclude, therefore, that, in all nations, which have embraced polytheism, the first ideas of religion arose not from a contemplation of the works of nature, but from a concern with regard to the events of life, and from the incessant hopes and fears, which actuate the human mind. Accordingly, we find, that all idolaters, having separated the provinces of their deities, have recourse to that invisible agent, to whose authority they are immediately subjected, and whose province it is to superintend that course of actions, in which they are, at any time, engaged. Juno is invoked at marriages; Lucina at births. Neptune receives the prayers of seamen; and Mars of warriors. The husbandman cultivates his field under the protection of Ceres; and the merchant acknowledges the authority of Mercury. Each natural event is supposed to be governed by some intelligent agent; and nothing prosperous or adverse can happen in life, which may not be the subject of peculiar prayers or thanksgivings.
      <br>&emsp;It must necessarily, indeed, be allowed, that, in order to carry men's attention beyond the present course of things, or lead them into any inference concerning invisible intelligent power, they must be actuated by some passion, which prompts their thought and reflection; some motive, which urges their first enquiry. But what passion shall we here have recourse to, for explaining an effect of such mighty consequence? Not speculative curiosity surely, or the pure love of truth. That motive is too refined for such gross apprehensions; and would lead men into enquiries concerning the frame of nature, a subject too large and comprehensive for their narrow capacities. No passions, therefore, can be supposed to work upon such barbarians, but the ordinary affections of human life; the anxious concern for happiness, the dread of future misery, the terror of death, the thirst of revenge, the appetite for food and other necessaries. Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature, especially the latter, men scrutinize, with a trembling curiosity, the course of future causes, and examine the various and contrary events of human life. And in this disordered scene, with eyes still more disordered and astonished, they see the first obscure traces of divinity.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="Thesubjectcontinued">
      We are placed in this world, as in a great theatre, where the true springs and causes of every event are entirely concealed from us; nor have we either sufficient wisdom to foresee, or power to prevent those ills, with which we are continually threatened. We hang in perpetual suspence between life and death, health and sickness, plenty and want; which are distributed amongst the human species by secret and unknown causes, whose operation is oft unexpected, and always unaccountable. These unknown causes, then, become the constant object of our hope and fear; and while the passions are kept in perpetual alarm by an anxious expectation of the events, the imagination is equally employed in forming ideas of those powers, on which we have so entire a dependance. Could men anatomize nature, according to the most probable, at least the most intelligible philosophy, they would find, that these causes are nothing but the particular fabric and structure of the minute parts of their own bodies and of external objects; and that, by a regular and constant machinery, all the events are produced, about which they are so much concerned. But this philosophy exceeds the comprehension of the ignorant multitude, who can only conceive the unknown causes in a general and confused manner; though their imagination, perpetually employed on the same subject, must labour to form some particular and distinct idea of them. The more they consider these causes themselves, and the uncertainty of their operation, the less satisfaction do they meet with in their researches; and, however unwilling, they must at last have abandoned so arduous an attempt, were it not for a propensity in human nature, which leads into a system, that gives them some satisfaction.
      <br>&emsp;There is an universal tendency among mankind to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer to every object, those qualities, with which they are familiarly acquainted, and of which they are intimately conscious. We find human faces in the moon, armies in the clouds; and by a natural propensity, if not corrected by experience and reflection, ascribe malice or good-will to every thing, that hurts or pleases us. Hence the frequency and beauty of the prosopopœia in poetry; where trees, mountains and streams are personified, and the inanimate parts of nature acquire sentiment and passion. And though these poetical figures and expressions gain not on the belief, they may serve, at least, to prove a certain tendency in the imagination, without which they could neither be beautiful nor natural. Nor is a river-god or hamadryad always taken for a mere poetical or imaginary personage; but may sometimes enter into the real creed of the ignorant vulgar; while each grove or field is represented as possessed of a particular genius or invisible power, which inhabits and protects it. Nay, philosophers cannot entirely exempt themselves from this natural frailty; but have oft ascribed to inanimate matter the horror of a vacuum, sympathies, antipathies, and other affections of human nature. The absurdity is not less, while we cast our eyes upwards; and transferring, as is too usual, human passions and infirmities to the deity, represent him as jealous and revengeful, capricious and partial, and, in short, a wicked and foolish man, in every respect but his superior power and authority. No wonder, then, that mankind, being placed in such an absolute ignorance of causes, and being at the same time so anxious concerning their future fortune, should immediately acknowledge a dependence on invisible powers, possessed of sentiment and intelligence. The unknown causes, which continually employ their thought, appearing always in the same aspect, are all apprehended to be of the same kind or species. Nor is it long before we ascribe to them thought and reason and passion, and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men, in order to bring them nearer to a resemblance with ourselves.
      <br>&emsp;In proportion as any man's course of life is governed by accident, we always find, that he encreases in superstition; as may particularly be observed of gamesters and sailors, who, though, of all mankind, the least capable of serious reflection, abound most in frivolous and superstitious apprehensions. The gods, says Coriolanus in Dionysius, have an influence in every affair; but above all, in war; where the event is so uncertain. All human life, especially before the institution of order and good government, being subject to fortuitous accidents; it is natural, that superstition should prevail every where in barbarous ages, and put men on the most earnest enquiry concerning those invisible powers, who dispose of their happiness or misery. Ignorant of astronomy and the anatomy of plants and animals, and too little curious to observe the admirable adjustment of final causes; they remain still unacquainted with a first and supreme creator, and with that infinitely perfect spirit, who alone, by his almighty will, bestowed order on the whole frame of nature. Such a magnificent idea is too big for their narrow conceptions, which can neither observe the beauty of the work, nor comprehend the grandeur of its author. They suppose their deities, however potent and invisible, to be nothing but a species of human creatures, perhaps raised from among mankind, and retaining all human passions and appetites, together with corporeal limbs and organs. Such limited beings, though masters of human fate, being, each of them, incapable of extending his influence every where, must be vastly multiplied, in order to answer that variety of events, which happen over the whole face of nature. Thus every place is stored with a crowd of local deities; and thus polytheism has prevailed, and still prevails, among the greatest part of uninstructed mankind.
      <br>&emsp;Any of the human affections may lead us into the notion of invisible, intelligent power; hope as well as fear, gratitude as well as affliction: But if we examine our own hearts, or observe what passes around us, we shall find, that men are much oftener thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the agreeable passions. Prosperity is easily received as our due, and few questions are asked concerning its cause or author. It begets cheerfulness and activity and alacrity and a lively enjoyment of every social and sensual pleasure: And during this state of mind, men have little leisure or inclination to think of the unknown invisible regions. On the other hand, every disastrous accident alarms us, and sets us on enquiries concerning the principles whence it arose: Apprehensions spring up with regard to futurity: And the mind, sunk into diffidence, terror, and melancholy, has recourse to every method of appeasing those secret intelligent powers, on whom our fortune is supposed entirely to depend.
      <br>&emsp;No topic is more usual with all popular divines than to display the advantages of affliction, in bringing men to a due sense of religion; by subduing their confidence and sensuality, which, in times of prosperity, make them forgetful of a divine providence. Nor is this topic confined merely to modern religions. The ancients have also employed it. Fortune has never liberally, without envy, says a Greek historian, bestowed an unmixed happiness on mankind; but with all her gifts has ever conjoined some disastrous circumstance, in order to chastize men into a reverence for the gods, whom, in a continued course of prosperity, they are apt to neglect and forget.
      <br>&emsp;What age or period of life is the most addicted to superstition? The weakest and most timid. What sex? The same answer must be given. The leaders and examples of every kind of superstition, says Strabo, are the women. These excite the men to devotion and supplications, and the observance of religious days. It is rare to meet with one that lives apart from the females, and yet is addicted to such practices. And nothing can, for this reason, be more improbable, than the account given of an order of men among the Getes, who practised celibacy, and were notwithstanding the most religious fanatics. A method of reasoning, which would lead us to entertain a bad idea of the devotion of monks; did we not know by an experience, not so common, perhaps, in Strabo's days, that one may practise celibacy, and profess chastity; and yet maintain the closest connexions and most entire sympathy with that timorous and pious sex.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="formersworld">
      The only point of theology, in which we shall find a consent of mankind almost universal, is, that there is invisible, intelligent power in the world: But whether this power be supreme or subordinate, whether confined to one being, or distributed among several, what attributes, qualities, connexions, or principles of action ought to be ascribed to those beings; concerning all these points, there is the widest difference in the popular systems of theology. Our ancestors in Europe, before the revival of letters, believed, as we do at present, that there was one supreme God, the author of nature, whose power, though in itself uncontroulable, was yet often exerted by the interposition of his angels and subordinate ministers, who executed his sacred purposes. But they also believed, that all nature was full of other invisible powers; fairies, goblins, elves, sprights; beings, stronger and mightier than men, but much inferior to the celestial natures, who surround the throne of God. Now, suppose, that any one, in those ages, had denied the existence of God and of his angels; would not his impiety justly have deserved the appellation of atheism, even though he had still allowed, by some odd capricious reasoning, that the popular stories of elves and fairies were just and well-grounded? The difference, on the one hand, between such a person and a genuine theist is infinitely greater than that, on the other, between him and one that absolutely excludes all invisible intelligent power. And it is a fallacy, merely from the casual resemblance of names, without any conformity of meaning, to rank such opposite opinions under the same denomination.
      <br>&emsp;To any one, who considers justly of the matter, it will appear, that the gods of all polytheists are no better than the elves or fairies of our ancestors, and merit as little any pious worship or veneration. These pretended religionists are really a kind of superstitious atheists, and acknowledge no being, that corresponds to our idea of a deity. No first principle of mind or thought: No supreme government and administration: No divine contrivance or intention in the fabric of the world.
      <br>&emsp;The Chinese, when their prayers are not answered, beat their idols. The deities of the Laplanders are any large stone which they meet with of an extraordinary shape. The Egyptian mythologists, in order to account for animal worship, said, that the gods, pursued by the violence of earth-born men, who were their enemies, had formerly been obliged to disguise themselves under the semblance of beasts. The Caunii, a nation in the Lesser Asia, resolving to admit no strange gods among them, regularly, at certain seasons, assembled themselves compleatly armed, beat the air with their lances, and proceeded in that manner to their frontiers; in order, as they said, to expel the foreign deities. Not even the immortal gods, said some German nations to Cæsar, are a match for the Suevi.
      <br>&emsp;Many ills, says Dione in Homer to Venus wounded by Diomede, many ills, my daughter, have the gods inflicted on men: And many ills, in return, have men inflicted on the gods. We need but open any classic author to meet with these gross representations of the deities; and Longinus with reason observes, that such ideas of the divine nature, if literally taken, contain a true atheism.
      <br>&emsp;Some writers have been surprized, that the impieties of Aristophanes should have been tolerated, nay publicly acted and applauded by the Athenians; a people so superstitious and so jealous of the public religion, that, at that very time, they put Socrates to death for his imagined incredulity. But these writers do not consider, that the ludicrous, familiar images, under which the gods are represented by that comic poet, instead of appearing impious, were the genuine lights in which the ancients conceived their divinities. What conduct can be more criminal or mean, than that of Jupiter in the Amphitrion? Yet that play, which represented his gallante exploits, was supposed so agreeable to him, that it was always acted in Rome by public authority, when the state was threatened with pestilence, famine, or any general calamity. The Romans supposed, that, like all old letchers, he would be highly pleased with the recital of his former feats of prowess and vigour, and that no topic was so proper, upon which to flatter his vanity.
      <br>&emsp;The Lacedemonians, says Xenophon, always, during war, put up their petitions very early in the morning, in order to be beforehand with their enemies, and, by being the first solicitors, pre-engage the gods in their favour. We may gather from Seneca, that it was usual, for the votaries in the temples, to make interest with the beadle or sexton, that they might have a seat near the image of the deity, in order to be the best heard in their prayers and applications to him. The Tyrians, when besieged by Alexander, threw chains on the statue of Hercules, to prevent that deity from deserting to the enemy. Augustus, having twice lost his fleet by storms, forbad Neptune to be carried in procession along with the other gods; and fancied, that he had sufficiently revenged himself by that expedient. After Germanicus's death, the people were so enraged at their gods, that they stoned them in their temples; and openly renounced all allegiance to them.
      <br>&emsp;To ascribe the origin and fabric of the universe to these imperfect beings never enters into the imagination of any polytheist or idolater. Hesiod, whose writings, with those of Homer, contained the canonical system of the heathens; Hesiod, I say, supposes gods and men to have sprung equally from the unknown powers of nature. And throughout the whole theogony of that author, Pandora is the only instance of creation or a voluntary production; and she too was formed by the gods merely from despight to Prometheus, who had furnished men with stolen fire from the celestial regions. The ancient mythologists, indeed, seem throughout to have rather embraced the idea of generation than that of creation or formation; and to have thence accounted for the origin of this universe.
      <br>&emsp;Ovid, who lived in a learned age, and had been instructed by philosophers in the principles of a divine creation or formation of the world; finding, that such an idea would not agree with the popular mythology, which he delivers, leaves it, in a manner, loose and detached from his system. Quisquis fuit ille Deorum? Whichever of the gods it was, says he, that dissipated the chaos, and introduced order into the universe. It could neither be Saturn, he knew, nor Jupiter, nor Neptune, nor any of the received deities of paganism. His theological system had taught him nothing upon that head; and he leaves the matter equally undetermined.
      <br>&emsp;Diodorus Siculus, beginning his work with an enumeration of the most reasonable opinions concerning the origin of the world, makes no mention of a deity or intelligent mind; though it is evident from his history, that he was much more prone to superstition than to irreligion. And in another passage, talking of the Ichthyophagi, a nation in India, he says, that, there being so great difficulty in accounting for their descent, we must conclude them to be aborigines, without any beginning of their generation, propagating their race from all eternity; as some of the physiologers, in treating of the origin of nature, have justly observed. But in such subjects as these, adds the historian, which exceed all human capacity, it may well happen, that those, who discourse the most, know the least; reaching a specious appearance of truth in their reasonings, while extremely wide of the real truth and matter of fact.
      <br>&emsp;A strange sentiment in our eyes, to be embraced by a professed and zealous religionist! But it was merely by accident, that the question concerning the origin of the world did ever in ancient times enter into religious systems, or was treated of by theologers. The philosophers alone made profession of delivering systems of this kind; and it was pretty late too before these bethought themselves of having recourse to a mind or supreme intelligence, as the first cause of all. So far was it from being esteemed profane in those days to account for the origin of things without a deity, that Thales, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, and others, who embraced that system of cosmogony, past unquestioned; while Anaxagoras, the first undoubted theist among the philosophers, was perhaps the first that ever was accused of atheism.
      <br>&emsp;We are told by Sextus Empiricus, that Epicurus, when a boy, reading with his preceptor these verses of Hesiod,
      <br>&emsp;Eldest of beings, chaos first arose;
      <br>&emsp;Next earth, wide-stretch'd, the seat of all:
      <br>&emsp;the young scholar first betrayed his inquisitive genius, by asking, And chaos whence? But was told by his preceptor, that he must have recourse to the philosophers for a solution of such questions. And from this hint Epicurus left philology and all other studies, in order to betake himself to that science, whence alone he expected satisfaction with regard to these sublime subjects.
      <br>&emsp;The common people were never likely to push their researches so far, or derive from reasoning their systems of religion; when philologers and mythologists, we see, scarcely ever discovered so much penetration. And even the philosophers, who discoursed of such topics, readily assented to the grossest theory, and admitted the joint origin of gods and men from night and chaos; from fire, water, air, or whatever they established to be the ruling element.
      <br>&emsp;Nor was it only on their first origin, that the gods were supposed dependent on the powers of nature. Throughout the whole period of their existence they were subjected to the dominion of fate or destiny. Think of the force of necessity, says Agrippa to the Roman people, that force, to which even the gods must submit. And the Younger Pliny, agreeably to this way of thinking, tells us, that amidst the darkness, horror, and confusion, which ensued upon the first eruption of Vesuvius, several concluded, that all nature was going to wrack, and that gods and men were perishing in one common ruin.
      <br>&emsp;It is great complaisance, indeed, if we dignify with the name of religion such an imperfect system of theology, and put it on a level with later systems, which are founded on principles more just and more sublime. For my part, I can scarcely allow the principles even of Marcus Aurelius, Plutarch, and some other Stoics and Academics, though much more refined than the pagan superstition, to be worthy of the honourable appellation of theism. For if the mythology of the heathens resemble the ancient European system of spiritual beings, excluding God and angels, and leaving only fairies and sprights; the creed of these philosophers may justly be said to exclude a deity, and to leave only angels and fairies.
      <br>&emsp;Whoever learns by argument, the existence of invisible intelligent power, must reason from the admirable contrivance of natural objects, and must suppose the world to be the workmanship of that divine being, the original cause of all things. But the vulgar polytheist, so far from admitting that idea, deifies every part of the universe, and conceives all the conspicuous productions of nature, to be themselves so many real divinities. The sun, moon, and stars, are all gods according to his system: Fountains are inhabited by nymphs, and trees by hamadryads: Even monkies, dogs, cats, and other animals often become sacred in his eyes, and strike him with a religious veneration. And thus, however strong men's propensity to believe invisible, intelligent power in nature, their propensity is equally strong to rest their attention on sensible, visible objects; and in order to reconcile these opposite inclinations, they are led to unite the invisible power with some visible object.
      <br>&emsp;The distribution also of distinct provinces to the several deities is apt to cause some allegory, both physical and moral, to enter into the vulgar systems of polytheism. The god of war will naturally be represented as furious, cruel, and impetuous: The god of poetry as elegant, polite, and amiable: The god of merchandise, especially in early times, as thievish and deceitful. The allegories, supposed in Homer and other mythologists, I allow, have often been so strained, that men of sense are apt entirely to reject them, and to consider them as the production merely of the fancy and conceit of critics and commentators. But that allegory really has place in the heathen mythology is undeniable even on the least reflection. Cupid the son of Venus; the Muses the daughters of Memory; Prometheus, the wise brother, and Epimetheus the foolish; Hygieia or the goddess of health descended from Æsculapius or the god of physic: Who sees not, in these, and in many other instances, the plain traces of allegory? When a god is supposed to preside over any passion, event, or system of actions, it is almost unavoidable to give him a genealogy, attributes, and adventures, suitable to his supposed powers and influence; and to carry on that similitude and comparison, which is naturally so agreeable to the mind of man.
      <br>&emsp;Allegories, indeed, entirely perfect, we ought not to expect as the productions of ignorance and superstition; there being no work of genius that requires a nicer hand, or has been more rarely executed with success. That Fear and Terror are the sons of Mars is just; but why by Venus? That Harmony is the daughter of Venus is regular; but why by Mars? That Sleep is the brother of Death is suitable; but why describe him as enamoured of one of the Graces? And since the ancient mythologists fall into mistakes so gross and palpable, we have no reason surely to expect such refined and long-spun allegories, as some have endeavoured to deduce from their fictions.
      <br>&emsp;Lucretius was plainly seduced by the strong appearance of allegory, which is observable in the pagan fictions. He first addresses himself to Venus as to that generating power, which animates, renews, and beautifies the universe: But is soon betrayed by the mythology into incoherencies, while he prays to that allegorical personage to appease the furies of her lover Mars: An idea not drawn from allegory, but from the popular religion, and which Lucretius, as an Epicurean, could not consistently admit of.
      <br>&emsp;The deities of the vulgar are so little superior to human creatures, that, where men are affected with strong sentiments of veneration or gratitude for any hero or public benefactor, nothing can be more natural than to convert him into a god, and fill the heavens, after this manner, with continual recruits from among mankind. Most of the divinities of the ancient world are supposed to have once been men, and to have been beholden for their apotheosis to the admiration and affection of the people. The real history of their adventures, corrupted by tradition, and elevated by the marvellous, become a plentiful source of fable; especially in passing through the hands of poets, allegorists, and priests, who successively improved upon the wonder and astonishment of the ignorant multitude.
      <br>&emsp;Painters too and sculptors came in for their share of profit in the sacred mysteries; and furnishing men with sensible representations of their divinities, whom they cloathed in human figures, gave great encrease to the public devotion, and determined its object. It was probably for want of these arts in rude and barbarous ages, that men deified plants, animals, and even brute, unorganized matter; and rather than be without a sensible object of worship, affixed divinity to such ungainly forms. Could any statuary of Syria, in early times, have formed a just figure of Apollo, the conic stone, Heliogabalus, had never become the object of such profound adoration, and been received as a representation of the solar deity.
      <br>&emsp;Stilpo was banished by the council of Areopagus, for affirming that the Minerva in the citadel was no divinity; but the workmanship of Phidias, the sculptor. What degree of reason must we expect in the religious belief of the vulgar in other nations; when Athenians and Areopagites could entertain such gross conceptions?
      <br>&emsp;These then are the general principles of polytheism, founded in human nature, and little or nothing dependent on caprice and accident. As the causes, which bestow happiness or misery, are, in general, very little known and very uncertain, our anxious concern endeavours to attain a determinate idea of them; and finds no better expedient than to represent them as intelligent voluntary agents, like ourselves; only somewhat superior in power and wisdom. The limited influence of these agents, and their great proximity to human weakness, introduce the various distribution and division of their authority; and thereby give rise to allegory. The same principles naturally deify mortals, superior in power, courage, or understanding, and produce hero-worship; together with fabulous history and mythological tradition, in all its wild and unaccountable forms. And as an invisible spiritual intelligence is an object too refined for vulgar apprehension, men naturally affix it to some sensible representation; such as either the more conspicuous parts of nature, or the statues, images, and pictures, which a more refined age forms of its divinities.
      <br>&emsp;Almost all idolaters, of whatever age or country, concur in these general principles and conceptions; and even the particular characters and provinces, which they assign to their deities, are not extremely different. The Greek and Roman travellers and conquerors, without much difficulty, found their own deities every where; and said, This is Mercury, that Venus; this Mars, that Neptune; by whatever title the strange gods might be denominated. The goddess Hertha of our Saxon ancestors seems to be no other, according to Tacitus, than the Mater Tellus of the Romans; and his conjecture was evidently just.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="TheismfromPolytheism">
      The doctrine of one supreme deity, the author of nature, is very ancient, has spread itself over great and populous nations, and among them has been embraced by all ranks and conditions of men: But whoever thinks that it has owed its success to the prevalent force of those invincible reasons, on which it is undoubtedly founded, would show himself little acquainted with the ignorance and stupidity of the people, and their incurable prejudices in favour of their particular superstitions. Even at this day, and in Europe, ask any of the vulgar, why he believes in an omnipotent creator of the world; he will never mention the beauty of final causes, of which he is wholly ignorant: He will not hold out his hand, and bid you contemplate the suppleness and variety of joints in his fingers, their bending all one way, the counterpoise which they receive from the thumb, the softness and fleshy parts of the inside of his hand, with all the other circumstances, which render that member fit for the use, to which it was destined. To these he has been long accustomed; and he beholds them with listlessness and unconcern. He will tell you of the sudden and unexpected death of such a one: The fall and bruise of such another: The excessive drought of this season: The cold and rains of another. These he ascribes to the immediate operation of providence: And such events, as, with good reasoners, are the chief difficulties in admitting a supreme intelligence, are with him the sole arguments for it.
      <br>&emsp;Many theists, even the most zealous and refined, have denied a particular providence, and have asserted, that the Sovereign mind or first principle of all things, having fixed general laws, by which nature is governed, gives free and uninterrupted course to these laws, and disturbs not, at every turn, the settled order of events by particular volitions. From the beautiful connexion, say they, and rigid observance of established rules, we draw the chief argument for theism; and from the same principles are enabled to answer the principal objections against it. But so little is this understood by the generality of mankind, that, wherever they observe any one to ascribe all events to natural causes, and to remove the particular interposition of a deity, they are apt to suspect him of the grossest infidelity. A little philosophy, says lord Bacon, makes men atheists: A great deal reconciles them to religion. For men, being taught, by superstitious prejudices, to lay the stress on a wrong place; when that fails them, and they discover, by a little reflection, that the course of nature is regular and uniform, their whole faith totters, and falls to ruin. But being taught, by more reflection, that this very regularity and uniformity is the strongest proof of design and of a supreme intelligence, they return to that belief, which they had deserted; and they are now able to establish it on a firmer and more durable foundation.
      <br>&emsp;Convulsions in nature, disorders, prodigies, miracles, though the most opposite to the plan of a wise superintendent, impress mankind with the strongest sentiments of religion; the causes of events seeming then the most unknown and unaccountable. Madness, fury, rage, and an inflamed imagination, though they sink men nearest to the level of beasts, are, for a like reason, often supposed to be the only dispositions, in which we can have any immediate communication with the Deity.
      <br>&emsp;We may conclude, therefore, upon the whole, that, since the vulgar, in nations, which have embraced the doctrine of theism, still build it upon irrational and superstitious principles, they are never led into that opinion by any process of argument, but by a certain train of thinking, more suitable to their genius and capacity.
      <br>&emsp;It may readily happen, in an idolatrous nation, that though men admit the existence of several limited deities, yet is there some one God, whom, in a particular manner, they make the object of their worship and adoration. They may either suppose, that, in the distribution of power and territory among the gods, their nation was subjected to the jurisdiction of that particular deity; or reducing heavenly objects to the model of things below, they may represent one god as the prince or supreme magistrate of the rest, who, though of the same nature, rules them with an authority, like that which an earthly sovereign exercises over his subjects and vassals. Whether this god, therefore, be considered as their peculiar patron, or as the general sovereign of heaven, his votaries will endeavour, by every art, to insinuate themselves into his favour; and supposing him to be pleased, like themselves, with praise and flattery, there is no eulogy or exaggeration, which will be spared in their addresses to him. In proportion as men's fears or distresses become more urgent, they still invent new strains of adulation; and even he who outdoes his predecessor in swelling up the titles of his divinity, is sure to be outdone by his successor in newer and more pompous epithets of praise. Thus they proceed; till at last they arrive at infinity itself, beyond which there is no farther progress: And it is well, if, in striving to get farther, and to represent a magnificent simplicity, they run not into inexplicable mystery, and destroy the intelligent nature of their deity, on which alone any rational worship or adoration can be founded. While they confine themselves to the notion of a perfect being, the creator of the world, they coincide, by chance, with the principles of reason and true philosophy; though they are guided to that notion, not by reason, of which they are in a great measure incapable, but by the adulation and fears of the most vulgar superstition.
      <br>&emsp;We often find, amongst barbarous nations, and even sometimes amongst civilized, that, when every strain of flattery has been exhausted towards arbitrary princes, when every human quality has been applauded to the utmost; their servile courtiers represent them, at last, as real divinities, and point them out to the people as objects of adoration. How much more natural, therefore, is it, that a limited deity, who at first is supposed only the immediate author of the particular goods and ills in life, should in the end be represented as sovereign maker and modifier of the universe?
      <br>&emsp;Even where this notion of a supreme deity is already established; though it ought naturally to lessen every other worship, and abase every object of reverence, yet if a nation has entertained the opinion of a subordinate tutelar divinity, saint, or angel; their addresses to that being gradually rise upon them, and encroach on the adoration due to their supreme deity. The Virgin Mary, ere checked by the reformation, had proceeded, from being merely a good woman, to usurp many attributes of the Almighty: God and St. Nicholas go hand in hand, in all the prayers and petitions of the Muscovites.
      <br>&emsp;Thus the deity, who, from love, converted himself into a bull, in order to carry off Europa; and who, from ambition, dethroned his father, Saturn, became the Optimus Maximus of the heathens. Thus, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, became the supreme deity or Jehovah of the Jews.
      <br>&emsp;The Jacobins, who denied the immaculate conception, have ever been very unhappy in their doctrine, even though political reasons have kept the Romish church from condemning it. The Cordeliers have run away with all the popularity. But in the fifteenth century, as we learn from Boulainvilliers, an Italian Cordelier maintained, that, during the three days, when Christ was interred, the hypostatic union was dissolved, and that his human nature was not a proper object of adoration, during that period. Without the art of divination, one might foretel, that so gross and impious a blasphemy would not fail to be anathematized by the people. It was the occasion of great insults on the part of the Jacobins; who now got some recompence for their misfortunes in the war about the immaculate conception.
      <br>&emsp;Rather than relinquish this propensity to adulation, religionists, in all ages, have involved themselves in the greatest absurdities and contradictions.
      <br>&emsp;Homer, in one passage, calls Oceanus and Tethys the original parents of all things, conformably to the established mythology and tradition of the Greeks: Yet, in other passages, he could not forbear complimenting Jupiter, the reigning deity, with that magnificent appellation; and accordingly denominates him the father of gods and men. He forgets, that every temple, every street was full of the ancestors, uncles, brothers, and sisters of this Jupiter; who was in reality nothing but an upstart parricide and usurper. A like contradiction is observable in Hesiod; and is so much the less excusable, as his professed intention was to deliver a true genealogy of the gods.
      <br>&emsp;Were there a religion (and we may suspect Mahometanism of this inconsistence) which sometimes painted the Deity in the most sublime colours, as the creator of heaven and earth; sometimes degraded him nearly to a level with human creatures in his powers and faculties; while at the same time it ascribed to him suitable infirmities, passions, and partialities, of the moral kind: That religion, after it was extinct, would also be cited as an instance of those contradictions, which arise from the gross, vulgar, natural conceptions of mankind, opposed to their continual propensity towards flattery and exaggeration. Nothing indeed would prove more strongly the divine origin of any religion, than to find (and happily this is the case with Christianity) that it is free from a contradiction, so incident to human nature.

      It appears certain, that, though the original notions of the vulgar represent the Divinity as a limited being, and consider him only as the particular cause of health or sickness; plenty or want; prosperity or adversity; yet when more magnificent ideas are urged upon them, they esteem it dangerous to refuse their assent. Will you say, that your deity is finite and bounded in his perfections; may be overcome by a greater force; is subject to human passions, pains, and infirmities; has a beginning, and may have an end? This they dare not affirm; but thinking it safest to comply with the higher encomiums, they endeavour, by an affected ravishment and devotion, to ingratiate themselves with him. As a confirmation of this, we may observe, that the assent of the vulgar is, in this case, merely verbal, and that they are incapable of conceiving those sublime qualities, which they seemingly attribute to the Deity. Their real idea of him, notwithstanding their pompous language, is still as poor and frivolous as ever.
      <br>&emsp;That original intelligence, say the Magians, who is the first principle of all things, discovers himself immediately to the mind and understanding alone; but has placed the sun as his image in the visible universe; and when that bright luminary diffuses its beams over the earth and the firmament, it is a faint copy of the glory, which resides in the higher heavens. If you would escape the displeasure of this divine being, you must be careful never to set your bare foot upon the ground, nor spit into a fire, nor throw any water upon it, even though it were consuming a whole city. Who can express the perfections of the Almighty? say the Mahometans. Even the noblest of his works, if compared to him, are but dust and rubbish. How much more must human conception fall short of his infinite perfections? His smile and favour renders men for ever happy; and to obtain it for your children, the best method is to cut off from them, while infants, a little bit of skin, about half the breadth of a farthing. Take two bits of cloth, say the Roman catholics, about an inch or an inch and a half square, join them by the corners with two strings or pieces of tape about sixteen inches long, throw this over your head, and make one of the bits of cloth lie upon your breast, and the other upon your back, keeping them next your skin: There is not a better secret for recommending yourself to that infinite Being, who exists from eternity to eternity.
      <br>&emsp;The Getes, commonly called immortal, from their steady belief of the soul's immortality, were genuine theists and unitarians. They affirmed Zamolxis, their deity, to be the only true god; and asserted the worship of all other nations to be addressed to mere fictions and chimeras. But were their religious principles any more refined, on account of these magnificent pretensions? Every fifth year they sacrificed a human victim, whom they sent as a messenger to their deity, in order to inform him of their wants and necessities. And when it thundered, they were so provoked, that, in order to return the defiance, they let fly arrows at him, and declined not the combat as unequal. Such at least is the account, which Herodotus gives of the theism of the immortal Getes.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="Fluxandreflux">
      It is remarkable, that the principles of religion have a kind of flux and reflux in the human mind, and that men have a natural tendency to rise from idolatry to theism, and to sink again from theism into idolatry. The vulgar, that is, indeed, all mankind, a few excepted, being ignorant and uninstructed, never elevate their contemplation to the heavens, or penetrate by their disquisitions into the secret structure of vegetable or animal bodies; so far as to discover a supreme mind or original providence, which bestowed order on every part of nature. They consider these admirable works in a more confined and selfish view; and finding their own happiness and misery to depend on the secret influence and unforeseen concurrence of external objects, they regard, with perpetual attention, the unknown causes, which govern all these natural events, and distribute pleasure and pain, good and ill, by their powerful, but silent, operation. The unknown causes are still appealed to on every emergence; and in this general appearance or confused image, are the perpetual objects of human hopes and fears, wishes and apprehensions. By degrees, the active imagination of men, uneasy in this abstract conception of objects, about which it is incessantly employed, begins to render them more particular, and to clothe them in shapes more suitable to its natural comprehension. It represents them to be sensible, intelligent beings, like mankind; actuated by love and hatred, and flexible by gifts and entreaties, by prayers and sacrifices. Hence the origin of religion: And hence the origin of idolatry or polytheism.
      <br>&emsp;But the same anxious concern for happiness, which begets the idea of these invisible, intelligent powers, allows not mankind to remain long in the first simple conception of them; as powerful, but limited beings; masters of human fate, but slaves to destiny and the course of nature. Men's exaggerated praises and compliments still swell their idea upon them; and elevating their deities to the utmost bounds of perfection, at last beget the attributes of unity and infinity, simplicity and spirituality. Such refined ideas, being somewhat disproportioned to vulgar comprehension, remain not long in their original purity; but require to be supported by the notion of inferior mediators or subordinate agents, which interpose between mankind and their supreme deity. These demi-gods or middle beings, partaking more of human nature, and being more familiar to us, become the chief objects of devotion, and gradually recal that idolatry, which had been formerly banished by the ardent prayers and panegyrics of timorous and indigent mortals. But as these idolatrous religions fall every day into grosser and more vulgar conceptions, they at last destroy themselves, and, by the vile representations, which they form of their deities, make the tide turn again towards theism. But so great is the propensity, in this alternate revolution of human sentiments, to return back to idolatry, that the utmost precaution is not able effectually to prevent it. And of this, some theists, particularly the Jews and Mahometans, have been sensible; as appears by their banishing all the arts of statuary and painting, and not allowing the representations, even of human figures, to be taken by marble or colours; lest the common infirmity of mankind should thence produce idolatry. The feeble apprehensions of men cannot be satisfied with conceiving their deity as a pure spirit and perfect intelligence; and yet their natural terrors keep them from imputing to him the least shadow of limitation and imperfection. They fluctuate between these opposite sentiments. The same infirmity still drags them downwards, from an omnipotent and spiritual deity, to a limited and corporeal one, and from a corporeal and limited deity to a statue or visible representation. The same endeavour at elevation still pushes them upwards, from the statue or material image to the invisible power; and from the invisible power to an infinitely perfect deity, the creator and sovereign of the universe.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="PersecutionToleration">
      Polytheism or idolatrous worship, being founded entirely in vulgar traditions, is liable to this great inconvenience, that any practice or opinion, however barbarous or corrupted, may be authorized by it; and full scope is given, for knavery to impose on credulity, till morals and humanity be expelled from the religious systems of mankind. At the same time, idolatry is attended with this evident advantage, that, by limiting the powers and functions of its deities, it naturally admits the gods of other sects and nations to a share of divinity, and renders all the various deities, as well as rites, ceremonies, or traditions, compatible with each other. Theism is opposite both in its advantages and disadvantages. As that system supposes one sole deity, the perfection of reason and goodness, it should, if justly prosecuted, banish every thing frivolous, unreasonable, or inhuman from religious worship, and set before men the most illustrious example, as well as the most commanding motives, of justice and benevolence. These mighty advantages are not indeed over-balanced (for that is not possible), but somewhat diminished, by inconveniencies, which arise from the vices and prejudices of mankind. While one sole object of devotion is acknowledged, the worship of other deities is regarded as absurd and impious. Nay, this unity of object seems naturally to require the unity of faith and ceremonies, and furnishes designing men with a pretence for representing their adversaries as profane, and the objects of divine as well as human vengeance. For as each sect is positive that its own faith and worship are entirely acceptable to the deity, and as no one can conceive, that the same being should be pleased with different and opposite rites and principles; the several sects fall naturally into animosity, and mutually discharge on each other that sacred zeal and rancour, the most furious and implacable of all human passions.
      <br>&emsp;The tolerating spirit of idolaters, both in ancient and modern times, is very obvious to any one, who is the least conversant in the writings of historians or travellers. When the oracle of Delphi was asked, what rites or worship was most acceptable to the gods? Those which are legally established in each city, replied the oracle. Even priests, in those ages, could, it seems, allow salvation to those of a different communion. The Romans commonly adopted the gods of the conquered people; and never disputed the attributes of those local and national deities, in whose territories they resided. The religious wars and persecutions of the Egyptian idolaters are indeed an exception to this rule; but are accounted for by ancient authors from reasons singular and remarkable. Different species of animals were the deities of the different sects among the Egyptians; and the deities being in continual war, engaged their votaries in the same contention. The worshippers of dogs could not long remain in peace with the adorers of cats or wolves. But where that reason took not place, the Egyptian superstition was not so incompatible as is commonly imagined; since we learn from Herodotus, that very large contributions were given by Amasis towards rebuilding the temple of Delphi.
      <br>&emsp;The intolerance of almost all religions, which have maintained the unity of God, is as remarkable as the contrary principle of polytheists. The implacable narrow spirit of the Jews is well known. Mahometanism set out with still more bloody principles; and even to this day, deals out damnation, though not fire and faggot, to all other sects. And if, among Christians, the English and Dutch have embraced the principles of toleration, this singularity has proceeded from the steady resolution of the civil magistrate, in opposition to the continued efforts of priests and bigots.
      <br>&emsp;The disciples of Zoroaster shut the doors of heaven against all but the Magians. Nothing could more obstruct the progress of the Persian conquests, than the furious zeal of that nation against the temples and images of the Greeks. And after the overthrow of that empire we find Alexander, as a polytheist, immediately re-establishing the worship of the Babylonians, which their former princes, as monotheists, had carefully abolished. Even the blind and devoted attachment of that conqueror to the Greek superstition hindered not but he himself sacrificed according to the Babylonish rites and ceremonies.
      <br>&emsp;So sociable is polytheism, that the utmost fierceness and antipathy, which it meets with in an opposite religion, is scarcely able to disgust it, and keep it at a distance. Augustus praised extremely the reserve of his grandson, Caius Cæsar, when this latter prince, passing by Jerusalem, deigned not to sacrifice according to the Jewish law. But for what reason did Augustus so much approve of this conduct? Only, because that religion was by the Pagans esteemed ignoble and barbarous.
      <br>&emsp;I may venture to affirm, that few corruptions of idolatry and polytheism are more pernicious to society than this corruption of theism, when carried to the utmost height. The human sacrifices of the Carthaginians, Mexicans, and many barbarous nations, scarcely exceed the inquisition and persecutions of Rome and Madrid. For besides, that the effusion of blood may not be so great in the former case as in the latter; besides this, I say, the human victims, being chosen by lot, or by some exterior signs, affect not, in so considerable a degree, the rest of the society. Whereas virtue, knowledge, love of liberty, are the qualities, which call down the fatal vengeance of inquisitors; and when expelled, leave the society in the most shameful ignorance, corruption, and bondage. The illegal murder of one man by a tyrant is more pernicious than the death of a thousand by pestilence, famine, or any undistinguishing calamity.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="courageabasement">
      From the comparison of theism and idolatry, we may form some other observations, which will also confirm the vulgar observation, that the corruption of the best things gives rise to the worst.
      <br>&emsp;Where the deity is represented as infinitely superior to mankind, this belief, though altogether just, is apt, when joined with superstitious terror, to sink the human mind into the lowest submission and abasement, and to represent the monkish virtues of mortification, penance, humility, and passive suffering, as the only qualities which are acceptable to him. But where the gods are conceived to be only a little superior to mankind, and to have been, many of them, advanced from that inferior rank, we are more at our ease in our addresses to them, and may even, without profaneness, aspire sometimes to a rivalship and emulation of them. Hence activity, spirit, courage, magnanimity, love of liberty, and all the virtues which aggrandize a people.
      <br>&emsp;The heroes in paganism correspond exactly to the saints in popery and holy dervises in Mahometanism. The place of Hercules, Theseus, Hector, Romulus, is now supplied by Dominic, Francis, Anthony, and Benedict. Instead of the destruction of monsters, the subduing of tyrants, the defence of our native country; whippings and fastings, cowardice and humility, abject submission and slavish obedience, are become the means of obtaining celestial honours among mankind.
      <br>&emsp;One great incitement to the pious Alexander in his warlike expeditions was his rivalship of Hercules and Bacchus, whom he justly pretended to have excelled. Brasidas, that generous and noble Spartan, after falling in battle, had heroic honours paid him by the inhabitants of Amphipolis, whose defence he had embraced. And in general, all founders of states and colonies among the Greeks were raised to this inferior rank of divinity, by those who reaped the benefit of their labours.
      <br>&emsp;This gave rise to the observation of Machiavel, that the doctrines of the Christian religion (meaning the catholic; for he knew no other) which recommend only passive courage and suffering, had subdued the spirit of mankind, and had fitted them for slavery and subjection. An observation, which would certainly be just, were there not many other circumstances in human society which controul the genius and character of a religion.
      <br>&emsp;Brasidas seized a mouse, and being bit by it, let it go. There is nothing so contemptible, said he, but what may be safe, if it has but courage to defend itself. Bellarmine patiently and humbly allowed the fleas and other odious vermin to prey upon him. We shall have heaven, said he, to reward us for our sufferings: But these poor creatures have nothing but the enjoyment of the present life. Such difference is there between the maxims of a Greek hero and a Catholic saint.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="reasonabsurdity">
      Here is another observation to the same purpose, and a new proof that the corruption of the best things begets the worst. If we examine, without prejudice, the ancient heathen mythology, as contained in the poets, we shall not discover in it any such monstrous absurdity, as we may at first be apt to apprehend. Where is the difficulty in conceiving, that the same powers or principles, whatever they were, which formed this visible world, men and animals, produced also a species of intelligent creatures, of more refined substance and greater authority than the rest? That these creatures may be capricious, revengeful, passionate, voluptuous, is easily conceived; nor is any circumstance more apt, among ourselves, to engender such vices, than the licence of absolute authority. And in short, the whole mythological system is so natural, that, in the vast variety of planets and worlds, contained in this universe, it seems more than probable, that, somewhere or other, it is really carried into execution.
      <br>&emsp;The chief objection to it with regard to this planet, is, that it is not ascertained by any just reason or authority. The ancient tradition, insisted on by heathen priests and theologers, is but a weak foundation; and transmitted also such a number of contradictory reports, supported, all of them, by equal authority, that it became absolutely impossible to fix a preference amongst them. A few volumes, therefore, must contain all the polemical writings of pagan priests: And their whole theology must consist more of traditional stories and superstitious practices than of philosophical argument and controversy.
      <br>&emsp;But where theism forms the fundamental principle of any popular religion, that tenet is so conformable to sound reason, that philosophy is apt to incorporate itself with such a system of theology. And if the other dogmas of that system be contained in a sacred book, such as the Alcoran, or be determined by any visible authority, like that of the Roman pontiff, speculative reasoners naturally carry on their assent, and embrace a theory, which has been instilled into them by their earliest education, and which also possesses some degree of consistence and uniformity. But as these appearances are sure, all of them, to prove deceitful, philosophy will soon find herself very unequally yoked with her new associate; and instead of regulating each principle, as they advance together, she is at every turn perverted to serve the purposes of superstition. For besides the unavoidable incoherences, which must be reconciled and adjusted; one may safely affirm, that all popular theology, especially the scholastic, has a kind of appetite for absurdity and contradiction. If that theology went not beyond reason and common sense, her doctrines would appear too easy and familiar. Amazement must of necessity be raised: Mystery affected: Darkness and obscurity sought after: And a foundation of merit afforded to the devout votaries, who desire an opportunity of subduing their rebellious reason, by the belief of the most unintelligible sophisms.
      <br>&emsp;Ecclesiastical history sufficiently confirms these reflections. When a controversy is started, some people always pretend with certainty to foretell the issue. Whichever opinion, say they, is most contrary to plain sense is sure to prevail; even where the general interest of the system requires not that decision. Though the reproach of heresy may, for some time, be bandied about among the disputants, it always rests at last on the side of reason. Any one, it is pretended, that has but learning enough of this kind to know the definition of Arian, Pelagian, Erestian, Socinian, Sabellian, Eutychian, Nestorian, Monothelite, &c. not to mention Protestant, whose fate is yet uncertain, will be convinced of the truth of this observation. It is thus a system becomes more absurd in the end, merely from its being reasonable and philosophical in the beginning.
      <br>&emsp;To oppose the torrent of scholastic religion by such feeble maxims as these, that it is impossible for the same thing, to be and not to be, that the whole is greater than a part, that two and three make five; is pretending to stop the ocean with a bull-rush. Will you set up profane reason against sacred mystery? No punishment is great enough for your impiety. And the same fires, which were kindled for heretics, will serve also for the destruction of philosophers.

      We meet every day with people so sceptical with regard to history, that they assert it impossible for any nation ever to believe such absurd principles as those of Greek and Egyptian paganism; and at the same time so dogmatical with regard to religion, that they think the same absurdities are to be found in no other communion. Cambyses entertained like prejudices; and very impiously ridiculed, and even wounded, Apis, the great god of the Egyptians, who appeared to his profane senses nothing but a large spotted bull. But Herodotus judiciously ascribes this sally of passion to a real madness or disorder of the brain: Otherwise, says the historian, he never would have openly affronted any established worship. For on that head, continues he, every nation are best satisfied with their own, and think they have the advantage over every other nation.
      <br>&emsp;It must be allowed, that the Roman Catholics are a very learned sect; and that no one communion, but that of the church of England, can dispute their being the most learned of all the Christian churches: Yet Averroes, the famous Arabian, who, no doubt, had heard of the Egyptian superstitions, declares, that, of all religions, the most absurd and nonsensical is that, whose votaries eat, after having created, their deity.
      <br>&emsp;I believe, indeed, that there is no tenet in all paganism, which would give so fair a scope to ridicule as this of the real presence: For it is so absurd, that it eludes the force of all argument. There are even some pleasant stories of that kind, which, though somewhat profane, are commonly told by the Catholics themselves. One day, a priest, it is said, gave inadvertently, instead of the sacrament, a counter, which had by accident fallen among the holy wafers. The communicant waited patiently for some time, expecting it would dissolve on his tongue: But finding that it still remained entire, he took it off. I wish, cried he to the priest, you have not committed some mistake: I wish you have not given me God the Father: He is so hard and tough there is no swallowing him.
      <br>&emsp;A famous general, at that time in the Muscovite service, having come to Paris for the recovery of his wounds, brought along with him a young Turk, whom he had taken prisoner. Some of the doctors of the Sorbonne (who are altogether as positive as the dervises of Constantinople) thinking it a pity, that the poor Turk should be damned for want of instruction, solicited Mustapha very hard to turn Christian, and promised him, for his encouragement, plenty of good wine in this world, and paradise in the next. These allurements were too powerful to be resisted; and therefore, having been well instructed and catechized, he at last agreed to receive the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's supper. The priest, however, to make every thing sure and solid, still continued his instructions; and began the next day with the usual question, How many Gods are there? None at all, replies Benedict; for that was his new name. How! None at all! cries the priest. To be sure, said the honest proselyte. You have told me all along that there is but one God: And yesterday I eat him.
      <br>&emsp;Such are the doctrines of our brethren the Catholics. But to these doctrines we are so accustomed, that we never wonder at them: Though in a future age, it will probably become difficult to persuade some nations, that any human, two-legged creature could ever embrace such principles. And it is a thousand to one, but these nations themselves shall have something full as absurd in their own creed, to which they will give a most implicit and most religious assent.
      <br>&emsp;I lodged once at Paris in the same hotel with an ambassador from Tunis, who, having passed some years at London, was returning home that way. One day I observed his Moorish excellency diverting himself under the porch, with surveying the splendid equipages that drove along; when there chanced to pass that way some Capucin friars, who had never seen a Turk; as he, on his part, though accustomed to the European dresses, had never seen the grotesque figure of a Capucin: And there is no expressing the mutual admiration, with which they inspired each other. Had the chaplain of the embassy entered into a dispute with these Franciscans, their reciprocal surprize had been of the same nature. Thus all mankind stand staring at one another; and there is no beating it into their heads, that the turban of the African is not just as good or as bad a fashion as the cowl of the European. He is a very honest man, said the prince of Sallee, speaking of de Ruyter, It is a pity he were a Christian.
      <br>&emsp;How can you worship leeks and onions? we shall suppose a Sorbonnist to say to a priest of Sais. If we worship them, replies the latter; at least, we do not, at the same time, eat them. But what strange objects of adoration are cats and monkies? says the learned doctor. They are at least as good as the relics or rotten bones of martyrs, answers his no less learned antagonist. Are you not mad, insists the Catholic, to cut one another's throat about the preference of a cabbage or a cucumber? Yes, says the pagan; I allow it, if you will confess, that those are still madder, who fight about the preference among volumes of sophistry, ten thousand of which are not equal in value to one cabbage or cucumber.
      <br>&emsp;Every by-stander will easily judge (but unfortunately the by-standers are few) that, if nothing were requisite to establish any popular system, but exposing the absurdities of other systems, every votary of every superstition could give a sufficient reason for his blind and bigotted attachment to the principles in which he has been educated. But without so extensive a knowledge, on which to ground this assurance (and perhaps, better without it), there is not wanting a sufficient stock of religious zeal and faith among mankind. Diodorus Siculus gives a remarkable instance to this purpose, of which he was himself an eye-witness. While Egypt lay under the greatest terror of the Roman name, a legionary soldier having inadvertently been guilty of the sacrilegious impiety of killing a cat, the whole people rose upon him with the utmost fury; and all the efforts of the prince were not able to save him. The senate and people of Rome, I am persuaded, would not, then, have been so delicate with regard to their national deities. They very frankly, a little after that time, voted Augustus a place in the celestial mansions; and would have dethroned every god in heaven, for his sake, had he seemed to desire it. Presens divus habebitur Augustus, says Horace. That is a very important point: And in other nations and other ages, the same circumstance has not been deemed altogether indifferent.
      <br>&emsp;Notwithstanding the sanctity of our holy religion, says Tully, no crime is more common with us than sacrilege: But was it ever heard of, that an Egyptian violated the temple of a cat, an ibis, or a crocodile? There is no torture, an Egyptian would not undergo, says the same author in another place, rather than injure an ibis, an aspic, a cat, a dog, or a crocodile. Thus it is strictly true, what Dryden observes,
      <br>&emsp;Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be,
      <br>&emsp;Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,
      <br>&emsp;In his defence his servants are as bold,
      <br>&emsp;As if he had been born of beaten gold.
      <br>&emsp;   Absolom and Achitophel.
      <br>&emsp;Nay, the baser the materials are, of which the divinity is composed, the greater devotion is he likely to excite in the breasts of his deluded votaries. They exult in their shame, and make a merit with their deity, in braving, for his sake, all the ridicule and contumely of his enemies. Ten thousand Crusaders inlist themselves under the holy banners; and even openly triumph in those parts of their religion, which their adversaries regard as the most reproachful.
      <br>&emsp;There occurs, I own, a difficulty in the Egyptian system of theology; as indeed, few systems of that kind are entirely free from difficulties. It is evident, from their method of propagation, that a couple of cats, in fifty years, would stock a whole kingdom; and if that religious veneration were still paid them, it would, in twenty more, not only be easier in Egypt to find a god than a man, which Petronius says was the case in some parts of Italy; but the gods must at last entirely starve the men, and leave themselves neither priests nor votaries remaining. It is probable, therefore, that this wise nation, the most celebrated in antiquity for prudence and sound policy, foreseeing such dangerous consequences, reserved all their worship for the full-grown divinities, and used the freedom to drown the holy spawn or little sucking gods, without any scruple or remorse. And thus the practice of warping the tenets of religion, in order to serve temporal interests, is not, by any means, to be regarded as an invention of these later ages.
      <br>&emsp;The learned, philosophical Varro, discoursing of religion, pretends not to deliver any thing beyond probabilities and appearances: Such was his good sense and moderation! But the passionate, the zealous Augustin, insults the noble Roman on his scepticism and reserve, and professes the most thorough belief and assurance. A heathen poet, however, contemporary with the saint, absurdly esteems the religious system of the latter so false, that even the credulity of children, he says, could not engage them to believe it.
      <br>&emsp;Is it strange, when mistakes are so common, to find every one positive and dogmatical? And that the zeal often rises in proportion to the error? Moverunt, says Spartian, & ea tempestate, Judæi bellum quod vetabantur mutilare genitalia.
      <br>&emsp;If ever there was a nation or a time, in which the public religion lost all authority over mankind, we might expect, that infidelity in Rome, during the Ciceronian age, would openly have erected its throne, and that Cicero himself, in every speech and action, would have been its most declared abettor. But it appears, that, whatever sceptical liberties that great man might take, in his writings or in philosophical conversation; he yet avoided, in the common conduct of life, the imputation of deism and profaneness. Even in his own family, and to his wife Terentia, whom he highly trusted, he was willing to appear a devout religionist; and there remains a letter, addressed to her, in which he seriously desires her to offer sacrifice to Apollo and Æsculapius, in gratitude for the recovery of his health.
      <br>&emsp;Pompey's devotion was much more sincere: In all his conduct, during the civil wars, he paid a great regard to auguries, dreams, and prophesies. Augustus was tainted with superstition of every kind. As it is reported of Milton, that his poetical genius never flowed with ease and abundance in the spring; so Augustus observed, that his own genius for dreaming never was so perfect during that season, nor was so much to be relied on, as during the rest of the year. That great and able emperor was also extremely uneasy, when he happened to change his shoes, and put the right foot shoe on the left foot. In short it cannot be doubted, but the votaries of the established superstition of antiquity were as numerous in every state, as those of the modern religion are at present. Its influence was as universal; though it was not so great. As many people gave their assent to it; though that assent was not seemingly so strong, precise, and affirmative.
      <br>&emsp;We may observe, that, notwithstanding the dogmatical, imperious style of all superstition, the conviction of the religionists, in all ages, is more affected than real, and scarcely ever approaches, in any degree, to that solid belief and persuasion, which governs us in the common affairs of life. Men dare not avow, even to their own hearts, the doubts which they entertain on such subjects: They make a merit of implicit faith; and disguise to themselves their real infidelity, by the strongest asseverations and most positive bigotry. But nature is too hard for all their endeavours, and suffers not the obscure, glimmering light, afforded in those shadowy regions, to equal the strong impressions, made by common sense and by experience. The usual course of men's conduct belies their words, and shows, that their assent in these matters is some unaccountable operation of the mind between disbelief and conviction, but approaching much nearer to the former than to the latter.
      <br>&emsp;Since, therefore, the mind of man appears of so loose and unsteady a texture, that, even at present, when so many persons find an interest in continually employing on it the chissel and the hammer, yet are they not able to engrave theological tenets with any lasting impression; how much more must this have been the case in ancient times, when the retainers to the holy function were so much fewer in comparison? No wonder, that the appearances were then very inconsistent, and that men, on some occasions, might seem determined infidels, and enemies to the established religion, without being so in reality; or at least, without knowing their own minds in that particular.
      <br>&emsp;Another cause, which rendered the ancient religions much looser than the modern, is, that the former were traditional and the latter are scriptural; and the tradition in the former was complex, contradictory, and, on many occasions, doubtful; so that it could not possibly be reduced to any standard and canon, or afford any determinate articles of faith. The stories of the gods were numberless like the popish legends; and though every one, almost, believed a part of these stories, yet no one could believe or know the whole: While, at the same time, all must have acknowledged, that no one part stood on a better foundation than the rest. The traditions of different cities and nations were also, on many occasions, directly opposite; and no reason could be assigned for preferring one to the other. And as there was an infinite number of stories, with regard to which tradition was nowise positive; the gradation was insensible, from the most fundamental articles of faith, to those loose and precarious fictions. The pagan religion, therefore, seemed to vanish like a cloud, whenever one approached to it, and examined it piecemeal. It could never be ascertained by any fixed dogmas and principles. And though this did not convert the generality of mankind from so absurd a faith; for when will the people be reasonable? yet it made them faulter and hesitate more in maintaining their principles, and was even apt to produce, in certain dispositions of mind, some practices and opinions, which had the appearance of determined infidelity.
      <br>&emsp;To which we may add, that the fables of the pagan religion were, of themselves, light, easy, and familiar; without devils, or seas of brimstone, or any object that could much terrify the imagination. Who could forbear smiling, when he thought of the loves of Mars and Venus, or the amorous frolics of Jupiter and Pan? In this respect, it was a true poetical religion; if it had not rather too much levity for the graver kinds of poetry. We find that it has been adopted by modern bards; nor have these talked with greater freedom and irreverence of the gods, whom they regarded as fictions, than the ancients did of the real objects of their devotion.
      <br>&emsp;The inference is by no means just, that, because a system of religion has made no deep impression on the minds of a people, it must therefore have been positively rejected by all men of common sense, and that opposite principles, in spite of the prejudices of education, were generally established by argument and reasoning. I know not, but a contrary inference may be more probable. The less importunate and assuming any species of superstition appears, the less will it provoke men's spleen and indignation, or engage them into enquiries concerning its foundation and origin. This in the mean time is obvious, that the empire of all religious faith over the understanding is wavering and uncertain, subject to every variety of humour, and dependent on the present incidents, which strike the imagination. The difference is only in the degrees. An ancient will place a stroke of impiety and one of superstition alternately, throughout a whole discourse: A modern often thinks in the same way, though he may be more guarded in his expression.
      <br>&emsp;Lucian tells us expressly that whoever believed not the most ridiculous fables of paganism was deemed by the people profane and impious. To what purpose, indeed, would that agreeable author have employed the whole force of his wit and satire against the national religion, had not that religion been generally believed by his countrymen and contemporaries?
      <br>&emsp;Livy acknowledges as frankly, as any divine would at present, the common incredulity of his age; but then he condemns it as severely. And who can imagine, that a national superstition, which could delude so ingenious a man, would not also impose on the generality of the people?
      <br>&emsp;The Stoics bestowed many magnificent and even impious epithets on their sage; that he alone was rich, free, a king, and equal to the immortal gods. They forgot to add, that he was not inferior in prudence and understanding to an old woman. For surely nothing can be more pitiful than the sentiments, which that sect entertained with regard to religious matters; while they seriously agree with the common augurs, that, when a raven croaks from the left, it is a good omen; but a bad one, when a rook makes a noise from the same quarter. Panætius was the only Stoic, among the Greeks, who so much as doubted with regard to auguries and divinations. Marcus Antoninus tells us, that he himself had received many admonitions from the gods in his sleep. It is true, Epictetus forbids us to regard the language of rooks and ravens; but it is not, that they do not speak truth: It is only, because they can foretel nothing but the breaking of our neck or the forfeiture of our estate; which are circumstances, says he, that nowise concern us. Thus the Stoics join a philosophical enthusiasm to a religious superstition. The force of their mind, being all turned to the side of morals, unbent itself in that of religion.
      <br>&emsp;Plato introduces Socrates affirming, that the accusation of impiety raised against him was owing entirely to his rejecting such fables, as those of Saturn's castrating his father Uranus, and Jupiter's dethroning Saturn: Yet in a subsequent dialogue, Socrates confesses, that the doctrine of the mortality of the soul was the received opinion of the people. Is there here any contradiction? Yes, surely: But the contradiction is not in Plato; it is in the people, whose religious principles in general are always composed of the most discordant parts; especially in an age, when superstition sate so easy and light upon them.
      <br>&emsp;The same Cicero, who affected, in his own family, to appear a devout religionist, makes no scruple, in a public court of judicature, of treating the doctrine of a future state as a ridiculous fable, to which no body could give any attention. Sallust represents Cæsar as speaking the same language in the open senate.
      <br>&emsp;But that all these freedoms implied not a total and universal infidelity and scepticism amongst the people, is too apparent to be denied. Though some parts of the national religion hung loose upon the minds of men, other parts adhered more closely to them: And it was the chief business of the sceptical philosophers to show, that there was no more foundation for one than for the other. This is the artifice of Cotta in the dialogues concerning the nature of the gods. He refutes the whole system of mythology by leading the orthodox gradually, from the more momentous stories, which were believed, to the more frivolous, which every one ridiculed: From the gods to the goddesses; from the goddesses to the nymphs; from the nymphs to the fawns and satyrs. His master, Carneades, had employed the same method of reasoning.
      <br>&emsp;Upon the whole, the greatest and most observable differences between a traditional, mythological religion, and a systematical, scholastic one, are two: The former is often more reasonable, as consisting only of a multitude of stories, which, however groundless, imply no express absurdity and demonstrative contradiction; and sits also so easy and light on men's mind, that, though it may be as universally received, it happily makes no such deep impression on the affections and understanding.
      <br>&emsp;It is strange that the Egyptian religion, though so absurd, should yet have borne so great a resemblance to the Jewish, that ancient writers even of the greatest genius were not able to observe any difference between them. For it is remarkable that both Tacitus, and Suetonius, when they mention that decree of the senate, under Tiberius, by which the Egyptian and Jewish proselytes were banished from Rome, expressly treat these religions as the same; and it appears, that even the decree itself was founded on that supposition. Actum & de sacris Ægyptiis, Judaicisque pellendis; factumque patrum consultum, ut quatuor millia libertini generis ea superstitione infecta, quis idonea ætas, in insulam Sardiniam veherentur, coercendis illic latrociniis; & si ob gravitatem cœli interissent, vile damnum: Ceteri cederent Italia, nisi certam ante diem profanos ritus exuissent. Tacit. ann. lib. ii, c. 85. Externas cæremonias, Ægyptios, Judaicosque ritus compescuit; coactus qui superstitione ea tenebantur, religiosas vestes cum instrumento omni comburere, &c. Sueton. Tiber. c. 36. These wise heathens, observing something in the general air, and genius, and spirit of the two religions to be the same, esteemed the differences of their dogmas too frivolous to deserve any attention.
      <br>&emsp;When Louis the XIVth took on himself the protection of the Jesuits' College of Clermont, the society ordered the king's arms to be put up over the gate, and took down the cross, in order to make way for it: Which gave occasion to the following epigram:
      <br>&emsp; Sustulit hinc Christi, posuitque insignia Regis:
      <br>&emsp;  Impia gens, alium nescit habere Deum.
      <br>&emsp;Witness this remarkable passage of Tacitus: Præter multiplices rerum humanarum casus, cœlo terraque prodigia, & fulminum monitus & futurorum præsagia, læta, tristia, ambigua, manifesta. Nec enim unquam atrocioribus populi Romani cladibus, magisque justis judiciis approbatum est, non esse curæ Diis securitatem nostram, esse ultionem. Hist. lib. i. Augustus's quarrel with Neptune is an instance of the same kind. Had not the emperor believed Neptune to be a real being, and to have dominion over the sea, where had been the foundation of his anger? And if he believed it, what madness to provoke still farther that deity? The same observation may be made upon Quintilian's exclamation, on account of the death of his children, lib. vi. Præf.
      <br>&emsp;The Stoics, I own, were not quite orthodox in the established religion; but one may see, from these instances, that they went a great way: And the people undoubtedly went every length.
      <br>&emsp;Xenophon's conduct, as related by himself, is, at once, an incontestable proof of the general credulity of mankind in those ages, and the incoherencies, in all ages, of men's opinions in religious matters. That great captain and philosopher, the disciple of Socrates, and one who has delivered some of the most refined sentiments with regard to a deity, gave all the following marks of vulgar, pagan superstition. By Socrates's advice, he consulted the oracle of Delphi, before he would engage in the expedition of Cyrus. De exped. lib. iii. p. 294. ex edit Leuncl. Sees a dream the night after the generals were seized; which he pays great regard to, but thinks ambiguous. Id. p. 295. He and the whole army regard sneezing as a very lucky omen. Id. p. 300. Has another dream, when he comes to the river Centrites, which his fellow-general, Chirosophus, also pays great regard to. Id. lib. iv. p. 323. The Greeks, suffering from a cold north wind, sacrifice to it; and the historian observes, that it immediately abated. Id. p. 329. Xenophon consults the sacrifices in secret, before he would form any resolution with himself about settling a colony. Lib. v. p. 359. He was himself a very skilful augur. Id. p. 361. Is determined by the victims to refuse the sole command of the army which was offered him. Lib. vi. p. 273. Cleander, the Spartan, though very desirous of it, refuses it for the same reason. Id. p. 392. Xenophon mentions an old dream with the interpretation given him, when he first joined Cyrus, p. 373. Mentions also the place of Hercules's descent into hell as believing it, and says the marks of it are still remaining. Id. p. 375. Had almost starved the army, rather than lead them to the field against the auspices. Id. p. 382, 383. His friend, Euclides, the augur, would not believe that he had brought no money from the expedition; till he (Euclides) sacrificed, and then he saw the matter clearly in the Exta. Lib. vii. p. 425. The same philosopher, proposing a project of mines for the encrease of the Athenian revenues, advises them first to consult the oracle. De rat. red. p. 392. That all this devotion was not a farce, in order to serve a political purpose, appears both from the facts themselves, and from the genius of that age, when little or nothing could be gained by hypocrisy. Besides, Xenophon, as appears from his Memorabilia, was a kind of heretic in those times, which no political devotee ever is. It is for the same reason, I maintain, that Newton, Locke, Clarke, &c. being Arians or Socinians, were very sincere in the creed they professed: And I always oppose this argument to some libertines, who will needs have it, that it was impossible but that these philosophers must have been hypocrites.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="Impiousconceptions">
      The primary religion of mankind arises chiefly from an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will naturally be entertained of invisible, unknown powers, while men lie under dismal apprehensions of any kind, may easily be conceived. Every image of vengeance, severity, cruelty, and malice must occur, and must augment the ghastliness and horror, which oppresses the amazed religionist. A panic having once seized the mind, the active fancy still farther multiplies the objects of terror; while that profound darkness, or, what is worse, that glimmering light, with which we are environed, represents the spectres of divinity under the most dreadful appearances imaginable. And no idea of perverse wickedness can be framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily, without scruple, apply to their deity.
      <br>&emsp;This appears the natural state of religion, when surveyed in one light. But if we consider, on the other hand, that spirit of praise and eulogy, which necessarily has place in all religions, and which is the consequence of these very terrors, we must expect a quite contrary system of theology to prevail. Every virtue, every excellence, must be ascribed to the divinity, and no exaggeration will be deemed sufficient to reach those perfections, with which he is endowed. Whatever strains of panegyric can be invented, are immediately embraced, without consulting any arguments or phænomena: It is esteemed a sufficient confirmation of them, that they give us more magnificent ideas of the divine objects of our worship and adoration.
      <br>&emsp;Here therefore is a kind of contradiction between the different principles of human nature, which enter into religion. Our natural terrors present the notion of a devilish and malicious deity: Our propensity to adulation leads us to acknowledge an excellent and divine. And the influence of these opposite principles are various, according to the different situation of the human understanding.
      <br>&emsp;In very barbarous and ignorant nations, such as the Africans and Indians, nay even the Japonese, who can form no extensive ideas of power and knowledge, worship may be paid to a being, whom they confess to be wicked and detestable; though they may be cautious, perhaps, of pronouncing this judgment of him in public, or in his temple, where he may be supposed to hear their reproaches.
      <br>&emsp;Such rude, imperfect ideas of the Divinity adhere long to all idolaters; and it may safely be affirmed, that the Greeks themselves never got entirely rid of them. It is remarked by Xenophon, in praise of Socrates, that this philosopher assented not to the vulgar opinion, which supposed the gods to know some things, and be ignorant of others: He maintained, that they knew every thing; what was done, said, or even thought. But as this was a strain of philosophy much above the conception of his countrymen, we need not be surprised, if very frankly, in their books and conversation, they blamed the deities, whom they worshipped in their temples. It is observable, that Herodotus in particular scruples not, in many passages, to ascribe envy to the gods; a sentiment, of all others, the most suitable to a mean and devilish nature. The pagan hymns, however, sung in public worship, contained nothing but epithets of praise; even while the actions ascribed to the gods were the most barbarous and detestable. When Timotheus, the poet, recited a hymn to Diana, in which he enumerated, with the greatest eulogies, all the actions and attributes of that cruel, capricious goddess: May your daughter, said one present, become such as the deity whom you celebrate.
      <br>&emsp;But as men farther exalt their idea of their divinity; it is their notion of his power and knowledge only, not of his goodness, which is improved. On the contrary, in proportion to the supposed extent of his science and authority, their terrors naturally augment; while they believe, that no secrecy can conceal them from his scrutiny, and that even the inmost recesses of their breast lie open before him. They must then be careful not to form expressly any sentiment of blame and disapprobation. All must be applause, ravishment, extacy. And while their gloomy apprehensions make them ascribe to him measures of conduct, which, in human creatures, would be highly blamed, they must still affect to praise and admire that conduct in the object of their devotional addresses. Thus it may safely be affirmed, that popular religions are really, in the conception of their more vulgar votaries, a species of dæmonism; and the higher the deity is exalted in power and knowledge, the lower of course is he depressed in goodness and benevolence; whatever epithets of praise may be bestowed on him by his amazed adorers. Among idolaters, the words may be false, and belie the secret opinion: But among more exalted religionists, the opinion itself contracts a kind of falsehood, and belies the inward sentiment. The heart secretly detests such measures of cruel and implacable vengeance; but the judgment dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable. And the additional misery of this inward struggle aggravates all the other terrors, by which these unhappy victims to superstition are for ever haunted.
      <br>&emsp;Lucian observes that a young man, who reads the history of the gods in Homer or Hesiod, and finds their factions, wars, injustice, incest, adultery, and other immoralities so highly celebrated, is much surprised afterwards, when he comes into the world, to observe that punishments are by law inflicted on the same actions, which he had been taught to ascribe to superior beings. The contradiction is still perhaps stronger between the representations given us by some later religions and our natural ideas of generosity, lenity, impartiality, and justice; and in proportion to the multiplied terrors of these religions, the barbarous conceptions of the divinity are multiplied upon us. Nothing can preserve untainted the genuine principles of morals in our judgment of human conduct, but the absolute necessity of these principles to the existence of society. If common conception can indulge princes in a system of ethics, somewhat different from that which should regulate private persons; how much more those superior beings, whose attributes, views, and nature are so totally unknown to us? Sunt superis sua jura. The gods have maxims of justice peculiar to themselves.
      <br>&emsp;Bacchus, a divine being, is represented by the heathen mythology as the inventor of dancing and the theatre. Plays were anciently even a part of public worship on the most solemn occasions, and often employed in times of pestilence, to appease the offended deities. But they have been zealously proscribed by the godly in later ages; and the playhouse, according to a learned divine, is the porch of hell.
      <br>&emsp;But in order to show more evidently, that it is possible for a religion to represent the divinity in still a more immoral and unamiable light than he was pictured by the ancients, we shall cite a long passage from an author of taste and imagination, who was surely no enemy to Christianity. It is the Chevalier Ramsay, a writer, who had so laudable an inclination to be orthodox, that his reason never found any difficulty, even in the doctrines which free-thinkers scruple the most, the trinity, incarnation, and satisfaction: His humanity alone, of which he seems to have had a great stock, rebelled against the doctrines of eternal reprobation and predestination. He expresses himself thus: ‘What strange ideas,' says he, ‘would an Indian or a Chinese philosopher have of our holy religion, if they judged by the schemes given of it by our modern free-thinkers, and pharisaical doctors of all sects? According to the odious and too vulgar system of these incredulous scoffers and credulous scribblers, The God of the Jews is a most cruel, unjust, partial, and fantastical being. He created, about 6000 years ago, a man and a woman, and placed them in a fine garden of Asia, of which there are no remains. This garden was furnished with all sorts of trees, fountains, and flowers. He allowed them the use of all the fruits of this beautiful garden, except one, that was planted in the midst thereof, and that had in it a secret virtue of preserving them in continual health and vigour of body and mind, of exalting their natural powers and making them wise. The devil entered into the body of a serpent, and solicited the first woman to eat of this forbidden fruit; she engaged her husband to do the same. To punish this slight curiosity and natural desire of life and knowledge, God not only threw our first parents out of paradise, but he condemned all their posterity to temporal misery, and the greatest part of them to eternal pains, though the souls of these innocent children have no more relation to that of Adam than to those of Nero and Mahomet; since, according to the scholastic drivellers, fabulists, and mythologists, all souls are created pure, and infused immediately into mortal bodies, so soon as the fœtus is formed. To accomplish the barbarous, partial decree of predestination and reprobation, God abandoned all nations to darkness, idolatry, and superstition, without any saving knowledge or salutary graces; unless it was one particular nation, whom he chose as his peculiar people. This chosen nation was, however, the most stupid, ungrateful, rebellious and persidious of all nations. After God had thus kept the far greater part of all the human species, during near 4000 years, in a reprobate state, he changed all of a sudden, and took a fancy for other nations beside the Jews. Then he sent his only begotten Son to the world, under a human form, to appease his wrath, satisfy his vindictive justice, and die for the pardon of sin. Very few nations, however, have heard of this gospel; and all the rest, though left in invincible ignorance, are damned without exception, or any possibility of remission. The greatest part of those who have heard of it, have changed only some speculative notions about God, and some external forms in worship: For, in other respects, the bulk of Christians have continued as corrupt as the rest of mankind in their morals; yea, so much the more perverse and criminal, that their lights were greater. Unless it be a very small select number, all other Christians, like the pagans, will be for ever damned; the great sacrifice offered up for them will become void and of no effect; God will take delight for ever, in their torments and blasphemies; and though he can, by one fiat change their hearts, yet they will remain for ever unconverted and unconvertible, because he will be for ever unappeasable and irreconcileable. It is true, that all this makes God odious, a hater of souls, rather than a lover of them; a cruel, vindictive tyrant, an impotent or a wrathful dæmon, rather than an all-powerful, beneficent father of spirits: Yet all this is a mystery. He has secret reasons for his conduct, that are impenetrable; and though he appears unjust and barbarous, yet we must believe the contrary, because what is injustice, crime, cruelty, and the blackest malice in us, is in him justice, mercy, and sovereign goodness. Thus the incredulous free-thinkers, the judaizing Christians, and the fatalistic doctors have disfigured and dishonoured the sublime mysteries of our holy faith; thus they have confounded the nature of good and evil; transformed the most monstrous passions into divine attributes, and surpassed the pagans in blasphemy, by ascribing to the eternal nature, as perfections, what makes the most horrid crimes amongst men. The grosser pagans contented themselves with divinizing lust, incest, and adultery; but the predestinarian doctors have divinized cruelty, wrath, fury, vengeance, and all the blackest vices.' See the Chevalier Ramsay's philosophical principles of natural and revealed religion, Part Ii. p. 401.
      <br>&emsp;The same author asserts, in other places, that the Arminian and Molinist schemes serve very little to mend the matter: And having thus thrown himself out of all received sects of Christianity, he is obliged to advance a system of his own, which is a kind of Origenism, and supposes the pre-existence of the souls both of men and beasts, and the eternal salvation and conversion of all men, beasts, and devils. But this notion, being quite peculiar to himself, we need not treat of. I thought the opinions of this ingenious author very curious; but I pretend not to warrant the justness of them.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="Badinfluence">
      Here I cannot forbear observing a fact, which may be worth the attention of such as make human nature the object of their enquiry. It is certain, that, in every religion, however sublime the verbal definition which it gives of its divinity, many of the votaries, perhaps the greatest number, will still seek the divine favour, not by virtue and good morals, which alone can be acceptable to a perfect being, but either by frivolous observances, by intemperate zeal, by rapturous extasies, or by the belief of mysterious and absurd opinions. The least part of the Sadder, as well as of the Pentateuch, consists in precepts of morality; and we may also be assured, that that part was always the least observed and regarded. When the old Romans were attacked with a pestilence, they never ascribed their sufferings to their vices, or dreamed of repentance and amendment. They never thought, that they were the general robbers of the world, whose ambition and avarice made desolate the earth, and reduced opulent nations to want and beggary. They only created a dictator, in order to drive a nail into a door; and by that means, they thought that they had sufficiently appeased their incensed deity.
      <br>&emsp;In Ægina, one faction forming a conspiracy, barbarously and treacherously assassinated seven hundred of their fellow-citizens; and carried their fury so far, that, one miserable fugitive having fled to the temple, they cut off his hands, by which he clung to the gates, and carrying him out of holy ground, immediately murdered him. By this impiety, says Herodotus, (not by the other many cruel assassinations) they offended the gods, and contracted an inexpiable guilt.
      <br>&emsp;Nay, if we should suppose, what never happens, that a popular religion were found, in which it was expressly declared, that nothing but morality could gain the divine favour; if an order of priests were instituted to inculcate this opinion, in daily sermons, and with all the arts of persuasion; yet so inveterate are the people's prejudices, that, for want of some other superstition, they would make the very attendance on these sermons the essentials of religion, rather than place them in virtue and good morals. The sublime prologue of Zaleucus's laws inspired not the Locrians, so far as we can learn, with any sounder notions of the measures of acceptance with the deity, than were familiar to the other Greeks.
      <br>&emsp;This observation, then, holds universally: But still one may be at some loss to account for it. It is sufficient to observe, that the people, every where, degrade their deities into a similitude with themselves, and consider them merely as a species of human creatures, somewhat more potent and intelligent. This will not remove the difficulty. For there is no man so stupid, as that, judging by his natural reason, he would not esteem virtue and honesty the most valuable qualities, which any person could possess. Why not ascribe the same sentiment to his deity? Why not make all religion, or the chief part of it, to consist in these attainments?
      <br>&emsp;Nor is it satisfactory to say, that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of superstition; and is therefore rejected. For, not to mention the excessive pennances of the Brachmans and Talapoins; it is certain, that the Rhamadan of the Turks, during which the poor wretches, for many days, often in the hottest months of the year, and in some of the hottest climates of the world, remain without eating or drinking from the rising to the setting sun; this Rhamadan, I say, must be more severe than the practice of any moral duty, even to the most vicious and depraved of mankind. The four lents of the Muscovites, and the austerities of some Roman Catholics, appear more disagreeable than meekness and benevolence. In short, all virtue, when men are reconciled to it by ever so little practice, is agreeable: All superstition is for ever odious and burthensome.
      <br>&emsp;Perhaps, the following account may be received as a true solution of the difficulty. The duties, which a man performs as a friend or parent, seem merely owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be wanting to these duties, without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality. A strong inclination may prompt him to the performance: A sentiment of order and moral obligation joins its force to these natural ties: And the whole man, if truly virtuous, is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavour. Even with regard to the virtues, which are more austere, and more founded on reflection, such as public spirit, filial duty, temperance, or integrity; the moral obligation, in our apprehension, removes all pretension to religious merit; and the virtuous conduct is deemed no more than what we owe to society and to ourselves. In all this, a superstitious man finds nothing, which he has properly performed for the sake of this deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favour and protection. He considers not, that the most genuine method of serving the divinity is by promoting the happiness of his creatures. He still looks out for some more immediate service of the supreme Being, in order to allay those terrors, with which he is haunted. And any practice, recommended to him, which either serves to no purpose in life, or offers the strongest violence to his natural inclinations; that practice he will the more readily embrace, on account of those very circumstances, which should make him absolutely reject it. It seems the more purely religious, because it proceeds from no mixture of any other motive or consideration. And if, for its sake, he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet, his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers. In restoring a loan, or paying a debt, his divinity is nowise beholden to him; because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no god in the universe. But if he fast a day, or give himself a sound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion, to the service of God. No other motive could engage him to such austerities. By these distinguished marks of devotion, he has now acquired the divine favour; and may expect, in recompence, protection and safety in this world, and eternal happiness in the next.
      <br>&emsp;Hence the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion: Hence, it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any certain inference in favour of a man's morals from the fervour or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere. Nay, it has been observed, that enormities of the blackest dye have been rather apt to produce superstitious terrors, and encrease the religious passion. Bomilcar, having formed a conspiracy for assassinating at once the whole senate of Carthage, and invading the liberties of his country, lost the opportunity, from a continual regard to omens and prophecies. Those who undertake the most criminal and most dangerous enterprizes are commonly the most superstitious; as an ancient historian remarks on this occasion. Their devotion and spiritual faith rise with their fears. Catiline was not contented with the established deities, and received rites of the national religion: His anxious terrors made him seek new inventions of this kind; which he never probably had dreamed of, had he remained a good citizen, and obedient to the laws of his country.
      <br>&emsp;To which we may add, that, after the commission of crimes, there arise remorses and secret horrors, which give no rest to the mind, but make it have recourse to religious rites and ceremonies, as expiations of its offences. Whatever weakens or disorders the internal frame promotes the interests of superstition: And nothing is more destructive to them than a manly, steady virtue, which either preserves us from disastrous, melancholy accidents, or teaches us to bear them. During such calm sunshine of the mind, these spectres of false divinity never make their appearance. On the other hand, while we abandon ourselves to the natural undisciplined suggestions of our timid and anxious hearts, every kind of barbarity is ascribed to the supreme Being, from the terrors with which we are agitated; and every kind of caprice, from the methods which we embrace in order to appease him. Barbarity, caprice; these qualities, however nominally disguised, we may universally observe, form the ruling character of the deity in popular religions. Even priests, instead of correcting these depraved ideas of mankind, have often been found ready to foster and encourage them. The more tremendous the divinity is represented, the more tame and submissive do men become to his ministers: And the more unaccountable the measures of acceptance required by him, the more necessary does it become to abandon our natural reason, and yield to their ghostly guidance and direction. Thus it may be allowed, that the artifices of men aggravate our natural infirmities and follies of this kind, but never originally beget them. Their root strikes deeper into the mind, and springs from the essential and universal properties of human nature.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="GeneralCorollary">
      Though the stupidity of men, barbarous and uninstructed, be so great, that they may not see a sovereign author in the more obvious works of nature, to which they are so much familiarized; yet it scarcely seems possible, that any one of good understanding should reject that idea, when once it is suggested to him. A purpose, an intention, a design is evident in every thing; and when our comprehension is so far enlarged as to contemplate the first rise of this visible system, we must adopt, with the strongest conviction, the idea of some intelligent cause or author. The uniform maxims too, which prevail throughout the whole frame of the universe, naturally, if not necessarily, lead us to conceive this intelligence as single and undivided, where the prejudices of education oppose not so reasonable a theory. Even the contrarieties of nature, by discovering themselves every where, become proofs of some consistent plan, and establish one single purpose or intention, however inexplicable and incomprehensible.
      <br>&emsp;Good and ill are universally intermingled and confounded; happiness and misery, wisdom and folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is pure and entirely of a piece. All advantages are attended with disadvantages. An universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence. And it is not possible for us, by our most chimerical wishes, to form the idea of a station or situation altogether desirable. The draughts of life, according to the poet's fiction, are always mixed from the vessels on each hand of Jupiter: Or if any cup be presented altogether pure, it is drawn only, as the same poet tells us, from the left-handed vessel.
      <br>&emsp;The more exquisite any good is, of which a small specimen is afforded us, the sharper is the evil, allied to it; and few exceptions are found to this uniform law of nature. The most sprightly wit borders on madness; the highest effusions of joy produce the deepest melancholy; the most ravishing pleasures are attended with the most cruel lassitude and disgust; the most flattering hopes make way for the severest disappointments. And, in general, no course of life has such safety (for happiness is not to be dreamed of) as the temperate and moderate, which maintains, as far as possible, a mediocrity, and a kind of insensibility, in every thing.
      <br>&emsp;As the good, the great, the sublime, the ravishing are found eminently in the genuine principles of theism; it may be expected, from the analogy of nature, that the base, the absurd, the mean, the terrifying will be equally discovered in religious fictions and chimeras.
      <br>&emsp;The universal propensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power, if not an original instinct, being at least a general attendant of human nature, may be considered as a kind of mark or stamp, which the divine workman has set upon his work; and nothing surely can more dignify mankind, than to be thus selected from all other parts of the creation, and to bear the image or impression of the universal Creator. But consult this image, as it appears in the popular religions of the world. How is the deity disfigured in our representations of him! What caprice, absurdity, and immorality are attributed to him! How much is he degraded even below the character, which we should naturally, in common life, ascribe to a man of sense and virtue!
      <br>&emsp;What a noble privilege is it of human reason to attain the knowledge of the supreme Being; and, from the visible works of nature, be enabled to infer so sublime a principle as its supreme Creator? But turn the reverse of the medal. Survey most nations and most ages. Examine the religious principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are any thing but sick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical asseverations of a being, who dignifies himself with the name of rational.
      <br>&emsp;Hear the verbal protestations of all men: Nothing so certain as their religious tenets. Examine their lives: You will scarcely think that they repose the smallest confidence in them.
      <br>&emsp;The greatest and truest zeal gives us no security against hypocrisy: The most open impiety is attended with a secret dread and compunction.
      <br>&emsp;No theological absurdities so glaring that they have not, sometimes, been embraced by men of the greatest and most cultivated understanding. No religious precepts so rigorous that they have not been adopted by the most voluptuous and most abandoned of men.
      <br>&emsp;Ignorance is the mother of Devotion: A maxim that is proverbial, and confirmed by general experience. Look out for a people, entirely destitute of religion: If you find them at all, be assured, that they are but few degrees removed from brutes.
      <br>&emsp;What so pure as some of the morals, included in some theological systems? What so corrupt as some of the practices, to which these systems give rise?
      <br>&emsp;The comfortable views, exhibited by the belief of futurity, are ravishing and delightful. But how quickly vanish on the appearance of its terrors, which keep a more firm and durable possession of the human mind?
      <br>&emsp;The whole is a riddle, an ænigma, an inexplicable mystery. Doubt, uncertainty, suspence of judgment appear the only result of our most accurate scrutiny, concerning this subject. But such is the frailty of human reason, and such the irresistible contagion of opinion, that even this deliberate doubt could scarcely be upheld; did we not enlarge our view, and opposing one species of superstition to another, set them a quarrelling; while we ourselves, during their fury and contention, happily make our escape, into the calm, though obscure, regions of philosophy.

      By the mere light of reason it seems difficult to prove the Immortality of the Soul. The arguments for it are commonly derived either from metaphysical topics, or moral or physical. But in reality, it is the gospel, and the gospel alone, that has brought life and immortality to light.
      <br>&emsp;I. Metaphysical topics are founded on the supposition that the soul is immaterial, and that it is impossible for thought to belong to a material substance.
      <br>&emsp;But just metaphysics teach us, that the notion of substance is wholly confused and imperfect, and that we have no other idea of any substance than as an aggregate of particular qualities, inhering in an unknown something. Matter, therefore, and spirit are at bottom equally unknown; and we cannot determine what qualities may inhere in the one or in the other.
      <br>&emsp;They likewise teach us, that nothing can be decided a priori concerning any cause or effect; and that experience being the only source of our judgments of this nature, we cannot know from any other principle, whether matter, by its structure or arrangement, may not be the cause of thought. Abstract reasonings cannot decide any question of fact or existence.
      <br>&emsp;But admitting a spiritual substance to be dispersed throughout the universe, like the etherial fire of the Stoics, and to be the only inherent subject of thought; we have reason to conclude from analogy, that nature uses it after the same manner she does the other substance, matter. She employs it as a kind of paste or clay; modifies it into a variety of forms and existences; dissolves after a time each modification; and from its substance erects a new form. As the same material substance may successively compose the body of all animals, the same spiritual substance may compose their minds: Their consciousness, or that system of thought, which they formed during life, may be continually dissolved by death; and nothing interest them in the new modification. The most positive asserters of the mortality of the soul, never denied the immortality of its substance. And that an immaterial substance, as well as a material, may lose its memory or consciousness appears, in part, from experience, if the soul be immaterial.
      <br>&emsp;Reasoning from the common course of nature, and without supposing any new interposition of the supreme cause, which ought always to be excluded from philosophy; what is incorruptible must also be ingenerable. The soul, therefore, if immortal, existed before our birth: And if the former state of existence no wise concerned us, neither will the latter.
      <br>&emsp;Animals undoubtedly feel, think, love, hate, will, and even reason, tho' in a more imperfect manner than man. Are their souls also immaterial and immortal?
      <br>&emsp;II. Let us now consider the moral arguments, chiefly those arguments derived from the justice of God, which is supposed to be farther interested in the farther punishment of the vicious, and reward of the virtuous.
      <br>&emsp;But these arguments are grounded on the supposition, that God has attributes beyond what he has exerted in this universe, with which alone we are acquainted. Whence do we infer the existence of these attributes?
      <br>&emsp;It is very safe for us to affirm, that, whatever we know the deity to have actually done, is best; but it is very dangerous to affirm, that he must always do what to us seems best. In how many instances would this reasoning fail us with regard to the present world?
      <br>&emsp;But if any purpose of nature be clear, we may affirm, that the whole scope and intention of man's creation, so far as we can judge by natural reason, is limited to the present life. With how weak a concern, from the original, inherent structure of the mind and passions, does he ever look farther? What comparison, either for steddiness or efficacy, between so floating an idea, and the most doubtful persuasion of any matter of fact, that occurs in common life.
      <br>&emsp;There arise, indeed, in some minds, some unaccountable terrors with regard to futurity: But these would quickly vanish, were they not artificially fostered by precept and education. And those, who foster them; what is their motive? Only to gain a livelihood, and to acquire power and riches in this world. Their very zeal and industry, therefore, are an argument against them.
      <br>&emsp;What cruelty, what iniquity, what injustice in nature, to confine thus all our concern, as well as all our knowledge, to the present life, if there be another scene still awaiting us, of infinitely greater consequence? Ought this barbarous deceit to be ascribed to a beneficent and wise being?
      <br>&emsp;Observe with what exact proportion the task to be performed and the performing powers are adjusted throughout all nature. If the reason of man gives him a great superiority above other animals, his necessities are proportionably multiplied upon him. His whole time, his whole capacity, activity, courage, passion, find sufficient employment, in fencing against the miseries of his present condition. And frequently, nay almost always, are too slender for the business assigned them.
      <br>&emsp;A pair of shoes, perhaps, was never yet wrought to the highest degree of perfection, which that commodity is capable of attaining. Yet is it necessary, at least very useful, that there should be some politicians and moralists, even some geometers, historians, poets, and philosophers among mankind.
      <br>&emsp;The powers of men are no more superior to their wants, considered merely in this life, than those of foxes and hares are, compared to their wants and to their period of existence. The inference from parity of reason is therefore obvious.
      <br>&emsp;On the theory of the soul's mortality, the inferiority of women's capacity is easily accounted for: Their domestic life requires no higher faculties either of mind or body. This circumstance vanishes and becomes absolutely insignificant, on the religious theory: The one sex has an equal task to perform with the other: Their powers of reason and resolution ought also to have been equal, and both of them infinitely greater than at present.
      <br>&emsp;As every effect implies a cause, and that another, till we reach the first cause of all, which is the Deity; every thing, that happens, is ordained by him; and nothing can be the object of his punishment or vengeance.
      <br>&emsp;By what rule are punishments and rewards distributed? What is the divine standard of merit and demerit? Shall we suppose, that human sentiments have place in the deity? However bold that hypothesis, we have no conception of any other sentiments.
      <br>&emsp;According to human sentiments, sense, courage, good manners, industry, prudence, genius, &c. are essential parts of personal merit. Shall we therefore erect an elysium for poets and heroes, like that of the antient mythology? Why confine all rewards to one species of virtue?
      <br>&emsp;Punishment, without any proper end or purpose, is inconsistent with our ideas of goodness and justice, and no end can be served by it after the whole scene is closed.
      <br>&emsp;Punishment, according to our conceptions, should bear some proportion to the offence. Why then eternal punishment for the temporary offences of so frail a creature as man? Can any one approve of Alexander's rage, who intended to exterminate a whole nation, because they had seized his favourite horse, Bucephalus?
      <br>&emsp;Heaven and hell suppose two distinct species of men, the good and the bad. But the greatest part of mankind float between vice and virtue.
      <br>&emsp;Were one to go round the world with an intention of giving a good supper to the righteous and a sound drubbing to the wicked, he would frequently be embarrassed in his choice, and would find, that the merits and the demerits of most men and women scarcely amount to the value of either.
      <br>&emsp;To suppose measures of approbation and blame, different from the human, confounds every thing. Whence do we learn, that there is such a thing as moral distinctions but from our own sentiments?
      <br>&emsp;What man, who has not met with personal provocation (or what good natur'd man who has) could inflict on crimes, from the sense of blame alone, even the common, legal, frivolous punishments? And does any thing steel the breast of judges and juries against the sentiments of humanity but reflections on necessity and public interest?
      <br>&emsp;By the Roman law, those who had been guilty of parricide and confessed their crime, were put into a sack, along with an ape, a dog, and a serpent; and thrown into the river: Death alone was the punishment of those, who denied their guilt, however fully proved. A criminal was tryed before Augustus, and condemned after full conviction: But the humane emperor, when he put the last interrogatory, gave it such a turn as to lead the wretch into a denial of his guilt. You surely, said the prince, did not kill your father. This lenity suits our natural ideas of right, even towards the greatest of all criminals, and even tho' it prevents so inconsiderable a sufferance. Nay, even the most bigotted priest would naturally, without reflection, approve of it; provided the crime was not heresy or infidelity. For as these crimes hurt himself in his temporal interests and advantages; perhaps he may not be altogether so indulgent to them.
      <br>&emsp;The chief source of moral ideas is the reflection on the interest of human society. Ought these interests, so short, so frivolous, to be guarded by punishments, eternal and infinite? The damnation of one man is an infinitely greater evil in the universe, than the subversion of a thousand millions of kingdoms.
      <br>&emsp;Nature has rendered human infancy peculiarly frail and mortal; as it were on purpose to refute the notion of a probationary state. The half of mankind dye before they are rational creatures.
      <br>&emsp;III. The physical arguments from the analogy of nature are strong for the mortality of the soul; and these are really the only philosophical arguments, which ought to be admitted with regard to this question, or indeed any question of fact.
      <br>&emsp;Where any two objects are so closely connected, that all alterations, which we have ever seen in the one, are attended with proportionable alterations in the other; we ought to conclude, by all rules of analogy, that, when there are still greater alterations produced in the former, and it is totally dissolved, there follows a total dissolution of the latter.
      <br>&emsp;Sleep, a very small effect on the body, is attended with a temporary extinction; at least, a great confusion in the soul.
      <br>&emsp;The weakness of the body and that of the mind in infancy are exactly proportioned; their vigor in manhood; their sympathetic disorder in sickness; their common gradual decay in old age. The step further seems unavoidable; their common dissolution in death.
      <br>&emsp;The last symptoms, which the mind discovers, are disorder, weakness, insensibility, stupidity, the forerunners of its annihilation. The farther progress of the same causes, encreasing the same effects, totally extinguish it.
      <br>&emsp;Judging by the usual analogy of nature, no form can continue, when transferred to a condition of life very different from the original one, in which it was placed. Trees perish in the water; fishes in the air; animals in the earth. Even so small a difference as that of climate is often fatal. What reason then to imagine, that an immense alteration, such as is made on the soul by the dissolution of its body and all its organs of thought and sensation, can be effected without the dissolution of the whole?
      <br>&emsp;Every thing is in common between soul and body. The organs of the one are all of them the organs of the other. The existence therefore of the one must be dependent on that of the other.
      <br>&emsp;The souls of animals are allowed to be mortal; and these bear so near a resemblance to the souls of men, that the analogy from one to the other forms a very strong argument. Their bodies are not more resembling; yet no one rejects the arguments drawn from comparative anatomy. The Metempsychosis is therefore the only system of this kind, that philosophy can so much as hearken to.
      <br>&emsp;Nothing in this world is perpetual. Every being, however seemingly firm, is in continual flux and change: The world itself gives symptoms of frailty and dissolution: How contrary to analogy, therefore, to imagine, that one single form, seemingly the frailest of any, and, from the slightest causes, subject to the greatest disorders, is immortal and indissoluble? What a daring theory is that! How lightly, not to say, how rashly entertained!
      <br>&emsp;How to dispose of the infinite number of posthumous existences ought also to embarrass the religious theory. Every planet, in every solar system, we are at liberty to imagine peopled with intelligent, mortal beings: At least, we can fix on no other supposition. For these, then, a new universe must, every generation, be created, beyond the bounds of the present universe; or one must have been created at first so prodigiously wide as to admit of this continual influx of beings. Ought such bold suppositions to be received by any philosophy; and that merely on the pretence of a bare possibility?
      <br>&emsp;When it is asked, whether Agamemnon, Thersites, Hannibal, Nero, and every stupid clown, that ever existed in Italy, Scythia, Bactria, or Guinea, are now alive; can any man think, that a scrutiny of nature will furnish arguments strong enough to answer so strange a question in the affirmative? The want of arguments, without revelation, sufficiently establishes the negative.
      <br>&emsp;Quanto facilius, says Pliny, certiusque sibi quemque credere, ac specimen securitatis antigenitali sumere experimento. Our insensibility, before the composition of the body, seems to natural reason a proof of a like state after its dissolution.
      <br>&emsp;Were our horror of annihilation an original passion, not the effect of our general love of happiness, it would rather prove the mortality of the soul. For as nature does nothing in vain, she would never give us a horror against an impossible event. She may give us a horror against an unavoidable event, provided our endeavours, as in the present case, may often remove it to some distance. Death is in the end unavoidable; yet the human species could not be preserved, had not nature inspired us with an aversion towards it.
      <br>&emsp;All doctrines are to be suspected, which are favoured by our passions. And the hopes and fears which gave rise to this doctrine, are very obvious.
      <br>&emsp;It is an infinite advantage in every controversy, to defend the negative. If the question be out of the common experienced course of nature, this circumstance is almost if not altogether decisive. By what arguments or analogies can we prove any state of existence, which no one ever saw, and which no wise resembles any that ever was seen? Who will repose such trust in any pretended philosophy, as to admit upon its testimony the reality of so marvellous a scene? Some new species of logic is requisite for that purpose; and some new faculties of the mind, which may enable us to comprehend that logic.
      <br>&emsp;Nothing could set in a fuller light the infinite obligations, which mankind have to divine revelation; since we find, that no other medium could ascertain this great and important truth.

      There is, in Dr. Tillotson's writings, an argument against the real presence, which is as concise, and elegant, and strong as any argument can possibly be supposed against a doctrine, so little worthy of a serious refutation. It is acknowledged on all hands, says that learned prelate, that the authority, either of the scripture or of tradition, is founded merely in the testimony of the apostles, who were eye-witnesses to those miracles of our Saviour, by which he proved his divine mission. Our evidence, then, for the truth of the Christian religion is less than the evidence for the truth of our senses; because, even in the first authors of our religion, it was no greater; and it is evident it must diminish in passing from them to their disciples; nor can any one rest such confidence in their testimony, as in the immediate object of his senses. But a weaker evidence can never destroy a stronger; and therefore, were the doctrine of the real presence ever so clearly revealed in scripture, it were directly contrary to the rules of just reasoning to give our assent to it. It contradicts sense, though both the scripture and tradition, on which it is supposed to be built, carry not such evidence with them as sense; when they are considered merely as external evidences, and are not brought home to every one's breast, by the immediate operation of the Holy Spirit.
      <br>&emsp;Nothing is so convenient as a decisive argument of this kind, which must at least silence the most arrogant bigotry and superstition, and free us from their impertinent solicitations. I flatter myself, that I have discovered an argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion, and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures. For so long, I presume, will the accounts of miracles and prodigies be found in all history, sacred and profane.
      <br>&emsp;Though experience be our only guide in reasoning concerning matters of fact; it must be acknowledged, that this guide is not altogether infallible, but in some cases is apt to lead us into errors. One, who in our climate, should expect better weather in any week of June than in one of December, would reason justly, and conformably to experience; but it is certain, that he may happen, in the event, to find himself mistaken. However, we may observe, that, in such a case, he would have no cause to complain of experience; because it commonly informs us beforehand of the uncertainty, by that contrariety of events, which we may learn from a diligent observation. All effects follow not with like certainty from their supposed causes. Some events are found, in all countries and all ages, to have been constantly conjoined together: Others are found to have been more variable, and sometimes to disappoint our expectations; so that, in our reasonings concerning matter of fact, there are all imaginable degrees of assurance, from the highest certainty to the lowest species of moral evidence.
      <br>&emsp;A wise man, therefore, proportions his belief to the evidence. In such conclusions as are founded on an infallible experience, he expects the event with the last degree of assurance, and regards his past experience as a full proof of the future existence of that event. In other cases, he proceeds with more caution: He weighs the opposite experiments: He considers which side is supported by the greater number of experiments: To that side he inclines, with doubt and hesitation; and when at last he fixes his judgment, the evidence exceeds not what we properly call probability. All probability, then, supposes an opposition of experiments and observations, where the one side is found to overbalance the other, and to produce a degree of evidence, proportioned to the superiority. A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory, reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we must balance the opposite experiments, where they are opposite, and deduct the smaller number from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior evidence.
      <br>&emsp;To apply these principles to a particular instance; we may observe, that there is no species of reasoning more common, more useful, and even necessary to human life, than that which is derived from the testimony of men, and the reports of eye-witnesses and spectators. This species of reasoning, perhaps, one may deny to be founded on the relation of cause and effect. I shall not dispute about a word. It will be sufficient to observe, that our assurance in any argument of this kind is derived from no other principle than our observation of the veracity of human testimony, and of the usual conformity of facts to the reports of witnesses. It being a general maxim, that no objects have any discoverable connexion together, and that all the inferences, which we can draw from one to another, are founded merely on our experience of their constant and regular conjunction; it is evident, that we ought not to make an exception to this maxim in favour of human testimony, whose connexion with any event seems, in itself, as little necessary as any other. Were not the memory tenacious to a certain degree; had not men commonly an inclination to truth and a principle of probity; were they not sensible to shame, when detected in a falsehood: Were not these, I say, discovered by experience to be qualities, inherent in human nature, we should never repose the least confidence in human testimony. A man delirious, or noted for falsehood and villany, has no manner of authority with us.
      <br>&emsp;And as the evidence, derived from witnesses and human testimony, is founded on past experience, so it varies with the experience, and is regarded either as a proof or a probability, according as the conjunction between any particular kind of report and any kind of object has been found to be constant or variable. There are a number of circumstances to be taken into consideration in all judgments of this kind; and the ultimate standard, by which we determine all disputes, that may arise concerning them, is always derived from experience and observation. Where this experience is not entirely uniform on any side, it is attended with an unavoidable contrariety in our judgments, and with the same opposition and mutual destruction of argument as in every other kind of evidence. We frequently hesitate concerning the reports of others. We balance the opposite circumstances, which cause any doubt or uncertainty; and when we discover a superiority on any side, we incline to it; but still with a diminution of assurance, in proportion to the force of its antagonist.
      <br>&emsp;This contrariety of evidence, in the present case, may be derived from several different causes; from the opposition of contrary testimony; from the character or number of the witnesses; from the manner of their delivering their testimony; or from the union of all these circumstances. We entertain a suspicion concerning any matter of fact, when the witnesses contradict each other; when they are but few, or of a doubtful character; when they have an interest in what they affirm; when they deliver their testimony with hesitation, or on the contrary, with too violent asseverations. There are many other particulars of the same kind, which may diminish or destroy the force of any argument, derived from human testimony.
      <br>&emsp;Suppose, for instance, that the fact, which the testimony endeavours to establish, partakes of the extraordinary and the marvellous; in that case, the evidence, resulting from the testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the fact is more or less unusual. The reason, why we place any credit in witnesses and historians, is not derived from any connexion, which we perceive à priori, between testimony and reality, but because we are accustomed to find a conformity between them. But when the fact attested is such a one as has seldom fallen under our observation, here is a contest of two opposite experiences; of which the one destroys the other, as far as its force goes, and the superior can only operate on the mind by the force, which remains. The very same principle of experience, which gives us a certain degree of assurance in the testimony of witnesses, gives us also, in this case, another degree of assurance against the fact, which they endeavour to establish; from which contradiction there necessarily arises a counterpoize, and mutual destruction of belief and authority.
      <br>&emsp;I should not believe such a story were it told me by Cato; was a proverbial saying in Rome, even during the lifetime of that philosophical patriot. The incredibility of a fact, it was allowed, might invalidate so great an authority.
      <br>&emsp;The Indian prince, who refused to believe the first relations concerning the effects of frost, reasoned justly; and it naturally required very strong testimony to engage his assent to facts, that arose from a state of nature, with which he was unacquainted, and which bore so little analogy to those events, of which he had had constant and uniform experience. Though they were not contrary to his experience, they were not conformable to it.
      <br>&emsp;But in order to encrease the probability against the testimony of witnesses, let us suppose, that the fact, which they affirm, instead of being only marvellous, is really miraculous; and suppose also, that the testimony, considered apart and in itself, amounts to an entire proof; in that case, there is proof against proof, of which the strongest must prevail, but still with a diminution of its force, in proportion to that of its antagonist.
      <br>&emsp;A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be imagined. Why is it more than probable, that all men must die; that lead cannot, of itself, remain suspended in the air; that fire consumes wood, and is extinguished by water; unless it be, that these events are found agreeable to the laws of nature, and there is required a violation of these laws, or in other words, a miracle to prevent them? Nothing is esteemed a miracle, if it ever happen in the common course of nature. It is no miracle that a man, seemingly in good health, should die on a sudden: because such a kind of death, though more unusual than any other, has yet been frequently observed to happen. But it is a miracle, that a dead man should come to life; because that has never been observed, in any age or country. There must, therefore, be a uniform experience against every miraculous event, otherwise the event would not merit that appellation. And as an uniform experience amounts to a proof, there is here a direct and full proof, from the nature of the fact, against the existence of any miracle; nor can such a proof be destroyed, or the miracle rendered credible, but by an opposite proof, which is superior.
      <br>&emsp;The plain consequence is (and it is a general maxim worthy of our attention), That no testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact, which it endeavours to establish: And even in that case there is a mutual destruction of arguments, and the superior only gives us an assurance suitable to that degree of force, which remains, after deducting the inferior. When any one tells me, that he saw a dead man restored to life, I immediately consider with myself, whether it be more probable, that this person should either deceive or be deceived, or that the fact, which he relates, should really have happened. I weigh the one miracle against the other; and according to the superiority, which I discover, I pronounce my decision, and always reject the greater miracle. If the falsehood of his testimony would be more miraculous, than the event which he relates; then, and not till then, can he pretend to command my belief or opinion.
      <br>&emsp;Part Ii.
      <br>&emsp;In the foregoing reasoning we have supposed, that the testimony, upon which a miracle is founded, may possibly amount to an entire proof, and that the falsehood of that testimony would be a real prodigy: But it is easy to shew, that we have been a great deal too liberal in our concession, and that there never was a miraculous event established on so full an evidence.
      <br>&emsp;For first, there is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good-sense, education, and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves; of such undoubted integrity, as to place them beyond all suspicion of any design to deceive others; of such credit and reputation in the eyes of mankind, as to have a great deal to lose in case of their being detected in any falsehood; and at the same time, attesting facts, performed in such a public manner, and in so celebrated a part of the world, as to render the detection unavoidable: All which circumstances are requisite to give us a full assurance in the testimony of men.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly. We may observe in human nature a principle, which, if strictly examined, will be found to diminish extremely the assurance, which we might, from human testimony, have, in any kind of prodigy. The maxim, by which we commonly conduct ourselves in our reasonings, is, that the objects, of which we have no experience, resemble those, of which we have; that what we have found to be most usual is always most probable; and that where there is an opposition of arguments, we ought to give the preference to such as are founded on the greatest number of past observations. But though, in proceeding by this rule, we readily reject any fact which is unusual and incredible in an ordinary degree; yet in advancing farther, the mind observes not always the same rule; but when any thing is affirmed utterly absurd and miraculous, it rather the more readily admits of such a fact, upon account of that very circumstance, which ought to destroy all its authority. The passion of surprize and wonder, arising from miracles, being an agreeable emotion, gives a sensible tendency towards the belief of those events, from which it is derived. And this goes so far, that even those who cannot enjoy this pleasure immediately, nor can believe those miraculous events, of which they are informed, yet love to partake of the satisfaction at second-hand or by rebound, and place a pride and delight in exciting the admiration of others.
      <br>&emsp;With what greediness are the miraculous accounts of travellers received, their descriptions of sea and land monsters, their relations of wonderful adventures, strange men, and uncouth manners? But if the spirit of religion join itself to the love of wonder, there is an end of common sense; and human testimony, in these circumstances, loses all pretensions to authority. A religionist may be an enthusiast, and imagine he sees what has no reality: He may know his narrative to be false, and yet persevere in it, with the best intentions in the world, for the sake of promoting so holy a cause: Or even where this delusion has not place, vanity, excited by so strong a temptation, operates on him more powerfully than on the rest of mankind in any other circumstances; and self-interest with equal force. His auditors may not have, and commonly have not, sufficient judgment to canvass his evidence: What judgment they have, they renounce by principle, in these sublime and mysterious subjects: Or if they were ever so willing to employ it, passion and a heated imagination disturb the regularity of its operations. Their credulity encreases his impudence: And his impudence overpowers their credulity.
      <br>&emsp;Eloquence, when at its highest pitch, leaves little room for reason or reflection; but addressing itself entirely to the fancy or the affections, captivates the willing hearers, and subdues their understanding. Happily, this pitch it seldom attains. But what a Tully or a Demosthenes could scarcely effect over a Roman or Athenian audience, every Capuchin, every itinerant or stationary teacher can perform over the generality of mankind, and in a higher degree, by touching such gross and vulgar passions.
      <br>&emsp;The many instances of forged miracles, and prophecies, and supernatural events, which, in all ages, have either been detected by contrary evidence, or which detect themselves by their absurdity, prove sufficiently the strong propensity of mankind to the extraordinary and the marvellous, and ought reasonably to beget a suspicion against all relations of this kind. This is our natural way of thinking, even with regard to the most common and most credible events. For instance: There is no kind of report, which rises so easily, and spreads so quickly, especially in country places and provincial towns, as those concerning marriages; insomuch that two young persons of equal condition never see each other twice, but the whole neighbourhood immediately join them together. The pleasure of telling a piece of news so interesting, of propagating it, and of being the first reporters of it, spreads the intelligence. And this is so well known, that no man of sense gives attention to these reports, till he find them confirmed by some greater evidence. Do not the same passions, and others still stronger, incline the generality of mankind to believe and report, with the greatest vehemence and assurance, all religious miracles?
      <br>&emsp;Thirdly. It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations, that they are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has ever given admission to any of them, that people will be found to have received them from ignorant and barbarous ancestors, who transmitted them with that inviolable sanction and authority, which always attend received opinions. When we peruse the first histories of all nations, we are apt to imagine ourselves transported into some new world; where the whole frame of nature is disjointed, and every element performs its operations in a different manner, from what it does at present. Battles, revolutions, pestilence, famine, and death, are never the effect of those natural causes, which we experience. Prodigies, omens, oracles, judgments, quite obscure the few natural events, that are intermingled with them. But as the former grow thinner every page, in proportion as we advance nearer the enlightened ages, we soon learn, that there is nothing mysterious or supernatural in the case, but that all proceeds from the usual propensity of mankind towards the marvellous, and that, though this inclination may at intervals receive a check from sense and learning, it can never be thoroughly extirpated from human nature.
      <br>&emsp;It is strange, a judicious reader is apt to say, upon the perusal of these wonderful historians, that such prodigious events never happen in our days. But it is nothing strange, I hope, that men should lie in all ages. You must surely have seen instances enow of that frailty. You have yourself heard many such marvellous relations started, which, being treated with scorn by all the wise and judicious, have at last been abandoned even by the vulgar. Be assured, that those renowned lies, which have spread and flourished to such a monstrous height, arose from like beginnings; but being sown in a more proper soil, shot up at last into prodigies almost equal to those which they relate.
      <br>&emsp;It was a wise policy in that false prophet, Alexander, who, though now forgotten, was once so famous, to lay the first scene of his impostures in Paphlagonia, where, as Lucian tells us, the people were extremely ignorant and stupid, and ready to swallow even the grossest delusion. People at a distance, who are weak enough to think the matter at all worth enquiry, have no opportunity of receiving better information. The stories come magnified to them by a hundred circumstances. Fools are industrious in propagating the imposture; while the wise and learned are contented, in general, to deride its absurdity, without informing themselves of the particular facts, by which it may be distinctly refuted. And thus the impostor above-mentioned was enabled to proceed, from his ignorant Paphlagonians, to the enlisting of votaries, even among the Grecian philosophers, and men of the most eminent rank and distinction in Rome: Nay, could engage the attention of that sage emperor Marcus Aurelius; so far as to make him trust the success of a military expedition to his delusive prophecies.
      <br>&emsp;The advantages are so great, of starting an imposture among an ignorant people, that, even though the delusion should be too gross to impose on the generality of them (which, though seldom, is sometimes the case) it has a much better chance for succeeding in remote countries, than if the first scene had been laid in a city renowned for arts and knowledge. The most ignorant and barbarous of these barbarians carry the report abroad. None of their countrymen have a large correspondence, or sufficient credit and authority to contradict and beat down the delusion. Men's inclination to the marvellous has full opportunity to display itself. And thus a story, which is universally exploded in the place where it was first started, shall pass for certain at a thousand miles distance. But had Alexander fixed his residence at Athens, the philosophers of that renowned mart of learning had immediately spread, throughout the whole Roman empire, their sense of the matter; which, being supported by so great authority, and displayed by all the force of reason and eloquence, had entirely opened the eyes of mankind. It is true; Lucian, passing by chance through Paphlagonia, had an opportunity of performing this good office. But, though much to be wished, it does not always happen, that every Alexander meets with a Lucian, ready to expose and detect his impostures.
      <br>&emsp;I may add as a fourth reason, which diminishes the authority of prodigies, that there is no testimony for any, even those which have not been expressly detected, that is not opposed by an infinite number of witnesses; so that not only the miracle destroys the credit of testimony, but the testimony destroys itself. To make this the better understood, let us consider, that, in matters of religion, whatever is different is contrary; and that it is impossible the religions of ancient Rome, of Turkey, of Siam, and of China should, all of them, be established on any solid foundation. Every miracle, therefore, pretended to have been wrought in any of these religions (and all of them abound in miracles), as its direct scope is to establish the particular system to which it is attributed; so has it the same force, though more indirectly, to overthrow every other system. In destroying a rival system, it likewise destroys the credit of those miracles, on which that system was established; so that all the prodigies of different religions are to be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of these prodigies, whether weak or strong, as opposite to each other. According to this method of reasoning, when we believe any miracle of Mahomet or his successors, we have for our warrant the testimony of a few barbarous Arabians: And on the other hand, we are to regard the authority of Titus Livius, Plutarch, Tacitus, and, in short, of all the authors and witnesses, Grecian, Chinese, and Roman Catholic, who have related any miracle in their particular religion; I say, we are to regard their testimony in the same light as if they had mentioned that Mahometan miracle, and had in express terms contradicted it, with the same certainty as they have for the miracle they relate. This argument may appear over subtile and refined; but is not in reality different from the reasoning of a judge, who supposes, that the credit of two witnesses, maintaining a crime against any one, is destroyed by the testimony of two others, who affirm him to have been two hundred leagues distant, at the same instant when the crime is said to have been committed.
      <br>&emsp;One of the best attested miracles in all profane history, is that which Tacitus reports of Vespasian, who cured a blind man in Alexandria, by means of his spittle, and a lame man by the mere touch of his foot; in obedience to a vision of the god Serapis, who had enjoined them to have recourse to the Emperor, for these miraculous cures. The story may be seen in that fine historian; where every circumstance seems to add weight to the testimony, and might be displayed at large with all the force of argument and eloquence, if any one were now concerned to enforce the evidence of that exploded and idolatrous superstition. The gravity, solidity, age, and probity of so great an emperor, who, through the whole course of his life, conversed in a familiar manner with his friends and courtiers, and never affected those extraordinary airs of divinity assumed by Alexander and Demetrius. The historian, a cotemporary writer, noted for candour and veracity, and withal, the greatest and most penetrating genius, perhaps, of all antiquity; and so free from any tendency to credulity, that he even lies under the contrary imputation, of atheism and profaneness: The persons, from whose authority he related the miracle, of established character for judgment and veracity, as we may well presume; eye-witnesses of the fact, and confirming their testimony, after the Flavian family was despoiled of the empire, and could no longer give any reward, as the price of a lie. Utrumque, qui interfuere, nunc quoque memorant, postquam nullum mendacio pretium. To which if we add the public nature of the facts, as related, it will appear, that no evidence can well be supposed stronger for so gross and so palpable a falsehood.
      <br>&emsp;There is also a memorable story related by Cardinal De Retz, which may well deserve our consideration. When that intriguing politician fled into Spain, to avoid the persecution of his enemies, he passed through Saragossa, the capital of Arragon, where he was shewn, in the cathedral, a man, who had served seven years as a door-keeper, and was well known to every body in town, that had ever paid his devotions at that church. He had been seen, for so long a time, wanting a leg; but recovered that limb by the rubbing of holy oil upon the stump; and the cardinal assures us that he saw him with two legs. This miracle was vouched by all the canons of the church; and the whole company in town were appealed to for a confirmation of the fact; whom the cardinal found, by their zealous devotion, to be thorough believers of the miracle. Here the relater was also cotemporary to the supposed prodigy, of an incredulous and libertine character, as well as of great genius; the miracle of so singular a nature as could scarcely admit of a counterfeit, and the witnesses very numerous, and all of them, in a manner, spectators of the fact, to which they gave their testimony. And what adds mightily to the force of the evidence, and may double our surprize on this occasion, is, that the cardinal himself, who relates the story, seems not to give any credit to it, and consequently cannot be suspected of any concurrence in the holy fraud. He considered justly, that it was not requisite, in order to reject a fact of this nature, to be able accurately to disprove the testimony, and to trace its falsehood, through all the circumstances of knavery and credulity which produced it. He knew, that, as this was commonly altogether impossible at any small distance of time and place; so was it extremely difficult, even where one was immediately present, by reason of the bigotry, ignorance, cunning, and roguery of a great part of mankind. He therefore concluded, like a just reasoner, that such an evidence carried falsehood upon the very face of it, and that a miracle, supported by any human testimony, was more properly a subject of derision than of argument.
      <br>&emsp;There surely never was a greater number of miracles ascribed to one person, than those, which were lately said to have been wrought in France upon the tomb of Abbé Paris, the famous Jansenist, with whose sanctity the people were so long deluded. The curing of the sick, giving hearing to the deaf, and sight to the blind, were every where talked of as the usual effects of that holy sepulchre. But what is more extraordinary; many of the miracles were immediately proved upon the spot, before judges of unquestioned integrity, attested by witnesses of credit and distinction, in a learned age, and on the most eminent theatre that is now in the world. Nor is this all: A relation of them was published and dispersed every where; nor were the Jesuits, though a learned body, supported by the civil magistrate, and determined enemies to those opinions, in whose favour the miracles were said to have been wrought, ever able distinctly to refute or detect them. Where shall we find such a number of circumstances, agreeing to the corroboration of one fact? And what have we to oppose to such a cloud of witnesses, but the absolute impossibility or miraculous nature of the events, which they relate? And this surely, in the eyes of all reasonable people, will alone be regarded as a sufficient refutation.
      <br>&emsp;Is the consequence just, because some human testimony has the utmost force and authority in some cases, when it relates the battle of Philippi or Pharsalia for instance; that therefore all kinds of testimony must, in all cases, have equal force and authority? Suppose that the Cæsarean and Pompeian factions had, each of them, claimed the victory in these battles, and that the historians of each party had uniformly ascribed the advantage to their own side; how could mankind, at this distance, have been able to determine between them? The contrariety is equally strong between the miracles related by Herodotus or Plutarch, and those delivered by Mariana, Bede, or any monkish historian.
      <br>&emsp;The wise lend a very academic faith to every report which favours the passion of the reporter; whether it magnifies his country, his family, or himself, or in any other way strikes in with his natural inclinations and propensities. But what greater temptation than to appear a missionary, a prophet, an ambassador from heaven? Who would not encounter many dangers and difficulties, in order to attain so sublime a character? Or if, by the help of vanity and a heated imagination, a man has first made a convert of himself, and entered seriously into the delusion; who ever scruples to make use of pious frauds, in support of so holy and meritorious a cause?
      <br>&emsp;The smallest spark may here kindle into the greatest flame; because the materials are always prepared for it. The avidum genus auricularum, the gazing populace, receive greedily, without examination, whatever sooths superstition, and promotes wonder.
      <br>&emsp;How many stories of this nature have, in all ages, been detected and exploded in their infancy? How many more have been celebrated for a time, and have afterwards sunk into neglect and oblivion? Where such reports, therefore, fly about, the solution of the phænomenon is obvious; and we judge in conformity to regular experience and observation, when we account for it by the known and natural principles of credulity and delusion. And shall we, rather than have a recourse to so natural a solution, allow of a miraculous violation of the most established laws of nature?
      <br>&emsp;I need not mention the difficulty of detecting a falsehood in any private or even public history, at the place, where it is said to happen; much more when the scene is removed to ever so small a distance. Even a court of judicature, with all the authority, accuracy, and judgment, which they can employ, find themselves often at a loss to distinguish between truth and falsehood in the most recent actions. But the matter never comes to any issue, if trusted to the common method of altercation and debate and flying rumours; especially when men's passions have taken part on either side.
      <br>&emsp;In the infancy of new religions, the wise and learned commonly esteem the matter too inconsiderable to deserve their attention or regard. And when afterwards they would willingly detect the cheat, in order to undeceive the deluded multitude, the season is now past, and the records and witnesses, which might clear up the matter, have perished beyond recovery.
      <br>&emsp;No means of detection remain, but those which must be drawn from the very testimony itself of the reporters: And these, though always sufficient with the judicious and knowing, are commonly too fine to fall under the comprehension of the vulgar.
      <br>&emsp;Upon the whole, then, it appears, that no testimony for any kind of miracle has ever amounted to a probability, much less to a proof; and that, even supposing it amounted to a proof, it would be opposed by another proof; derived from the very nature of the fact, which it would endeavour to establish. It is experience only, which gives authority to human testimony; and it is the same experience, which assures us of the laws of nature. When, therefore, these two kinds of experience are contrary, we have nothing to do but substract the one from the other, and embrace an opinion, either on one side or the other, with that assurance which arises from the remainder. But according to the principle here explained, this substraction, with regard to all popular religions, amounts to an entire annihilation; and therefore we may establish it as a maxim, that no human testimony can have such force as to prove a miracle, and make it a just foundation for any such system of religion.
      <br>&emsp;I beg the limitations here made may be remarked, when I say, that a miracle can never be proved, so as to be the foundation of a system of religion. For I own, that otherwise, there may possibly be miracles, or violations of the usual course of nature, of such a kind as to admit of proof from human testimony; though, perhaps, it will be impossible to find any such in all the records of history. Thus, suppose, all authors, in all languages, agree, that, from the first of January 1600, there was a total darkness over the whole earth for eight days: Suppose that the tradition of this extraordinary event is still strong and lively among the people: That all travellers, who return from foreign countries, bring us accounts of the same tradition, without the least variation or contradiction: It is evident, that our present philosophers, instead of doubting the fact, ought to receive it as certain, and ought to search for the causes whence it might be derived. The decay, corruption, and dissolution of nature, is an event rendered probable by so many analogies, that any phænomenon, which seems to have a tendency towards that catastrophe, comes within the reach of human testimony, if that testimony be very extensive and uniform.
      <br>&emsp;But suppose, that all the historians who treat of England, should agree, that, on the first of January 1600, Queen Elizabeth died; that both before and after her death she was seen by her physicians and the whole court, as is usual with persons of her rank; that her successor was acknowledged and proclaimed by the parliament; and that, after being interred a month, she again appeared, resumed the throne, and governed England for three years: I must confess that I should be surprized at the concurrence of so many odd circumstances, but should not have the least inclination to believe so miraculous an event. I should not doubt of her pretended death, and of those other public circumstances that followed it: I should only assert it to have been pretended, and that it neither was, nor possibly could be real. You would in vain object to me the difficulty, and almost impossibility of deceiving the world in an affair of such consequence; the wisdom and solid judgment of that renowned queen; with the little or no advantage which she could reap from so poor an artifice: All this might astonish me; but I would still reply, that the knavery and folly of men are such common phænomena, that I should rather believe the most extraordinary events to arise from their concurrence, than admit of so signal a violation of the laws of nature.
      <br>&emsp;But should this miracle be ascribed to any new system of religion; men, in all ages, have been so much imposed on by ridiculous stories of that kind, that this very circumstance would be a full proof of a cheat, and sufficient, with all men of sense, not only to make them reject the fact, but even reject it without farther examination. Though the Being to whom the miracle is ascribed, be, in this case, Almighty, it does not, upon that account, become a whit more probable; since it is impossible for us to know the attributes or actions of such a Being, otherwise than from the experience which we have of his productions, in the usual course of nature. This still reduces us to past observation, and obliges us to compare the instances of the violation of truth in the testimony of men, with those of the violation of the laws of nature by miracles, in order to judge which of them is most likely and probable. As the violations of truth are more common in the testimony concerning religious miracles, than in that concerning any other matter of fact; this must diminish very much the authority of the former testimony, and make us form a general resolution, never to lend any attention to it, with whatever specious pretence it may be covered.
      <br>&emsp;Lord Bacon seems to have embraced the same principles of reasoning. We ought, says he, to make a collection or particular history of all monsters and prodigious births or productions, and in a word of every thing new, rare, and extraordinary in nature. But this must be done with the most severe scrutiny, lest we depart from truth. Above all, every relation must be considered as suspicious, which depends in any degree upon religion, as the prodigies of Livy: And no less so, every thing that is to be found in the writers of natural magic or alchimy, or such authors, who seem, all of them, to have an unconquerable appetite for falsehood and fable.
      <br>&emsp;I am the better pleased with the method of reasoning here delivered, as I think it may serve to confound those dangerous friends or disguised enemies to the Christian Religion, who have undertaken to defend it by the principles of human reason. Our most holy religion is founded on Faith, not on reason; and it is a sure method of exposing it to put it to such a trial as it is, by no means, fitted to endure. To make this more evident, let us examine those miracles, related in scripture; and not to lose ourselves in too wide a field, let us confine ourselves to such as we find in the Pentateuch, which we shall examine, according to the principles of these pretended Christians, not as the word or testimony of God himself, but as the production of a mere human writer and historian. Here then we are first to consider a book, presented to us by a barbarous and ignorant people, written in an age when they were still more barbarous, and in all probability long after the facts which it relates, corroborated by no concurring testimony, and resembling those fabulous accounts, which every nation gives of its origin. Upon reading this book, we find it full of prodigies and miracles. It gives an account of a state of the world and of human nature entirely different from the present: Of our fall from that state: Of the age of man, extended to near a thousand years: Of the destruction of the world by a deluge: Of the arbitrary choice of one people, as the favourites of heaven; and that people the countrymen of the author: Of their deliverance from bondage by prodigies the most astonishing imaginable: I desire any one to lay his hand upon his heart, and after a serious consideration declare, whether he thinks that the falsehood of such a book, supported by such a testimony, would be more extraordinary and miraculous than all the miracles it relates; which is, however, necessary to make it be received, according to the measures of probability above established.
      <br>&emsp;What we have said of miracles may be applied, without any variation, to prophecies; and indeed, all prophecies are real miracles, and as such only, can be admitted as proofs of any revelation. If it did not exceed the capacity of human nature to foretel future events, it would be absurd to employ any prophecy as an argument for a divine mission or authority from heaven. So that, upon the whole, we may conclude, that the Christian Religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one. Mere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity: And whoever is moved by Faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all the principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to believe what is most contrary to custom and experience.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="ProvidenceFutureState">
      Iwas lately engaged in conversation with a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes; where, though he advanced many principles, of which I can by no means approve, yet as they seem to be curious, and to bear some relation to the chain of reasoning carried on throughout this enquiry, I shall here copy them from my memory as accurately as I can, in order to submit them to the judgment of the reader.
      <br>&emsp;Our conversation began with my admiring the singular good fortune of philosophy, which, as it requires entire liberty above all other privileges, and chiefly flourishes from the free opposition of sentiments and argumentation, received its first birth in an age and country of freedom and toleration, and was never cramped, even in its most extravagant principles, by any creeds, confessions, or penal statutes. For, except the banishment of Protagoras, and the death of Socrates, which last event proceeded partly from other motives, there are scarcely any instances to be met with, in ancient history, of this bigotted jealousy, with which the present age is so much infested. Epicurus lived at Athens to an advanced age, in peace and tranquillity: Epicureans were even admitted to receive the sacerdotal character, and to officiate at the altar, in the most sacred rites of the established religion: And the public encouragement of pensions and salaries was afforded equally, by the wisest of all the Roman emperors, to the professors of every sect of philosophy. How requisite such kind of treatment was to philosophy, in her early youth, will easily be conceived, if we reflect, that, even at present, when she may be supposed more hardy and robust, she bears with much difficulty the inclemency of the seasons, and those harsh winds of calumny and persecution, which blow upon her.
      <br>&emsp;You admire, says my friend, as the singular good fortune of philosophy, what seems to result from the natural course of things, and to be unavoidable in every age and nation. This pertinacious bigotry, of which you complain, as so fatal to philosophy, is really her offspring, who, after allying with superstition, separates himself entirely from the interest of his parent, and becomes her most inveterate enemy and persecutor. Speculative dogmas of religion, the present occasions of such furious dispute, could not possibly be conceived or admitted in the early ages of the world; when mankind, being wholly illiterate, formed an idea of religion more suitable to their weak apprehension, and composed their sacred tenets of such tales chiefly as were the objects of traditional belief, more than of argument or disputation. After the first alarm, therefore, was over, which arose from the new paradoxes and principles of the philosophers; these teachers seem ever after, during the ages of antiquity, to have lived in great harmony with the established superstition, and to have made a fair partition of mankind between them; the former claiming all the learned and wise, the latter possessing all the vulgar and illiterate.
      <br>&emsp;It seems then, say I, that you leave politics entirely out of the question, and never suppose, that a wise magistrate can justly be jealous of certain tenets of philosophy, such as those of Epicurus, which, denying a divine existence, and consequently a providence and a future state, seem to loosen, in a great measure, the ties of morality, and may be supposed, for that reason, pernicious to the peace of civil society.
      <br>&emsp;I know, replied he, that in fact these persecutions never, in any age, proceeded from calm reason, or from experience of the pernicious consequences of philosophy; but arose entirely from passion and prejudice. But what if I should advance farther, and assert, that, if Epicurus had been accused before the people, by any of the sycophants or informers of those days, he could easily have defended his cause, and proved his principles of philosophy to be as salutary as those of his adversaries, who endeavoured, with such zeal, to expose him to the public hatred and jealousy?
      <br>&emsp;I wish, said I, you would try your eloquence upon so extraordinary a topic, and make a speech for Epicurus, which might satisfy, not the mob of Athens, if you will allow that ancient and polite city to have contained any mob, but the more philosophical part of his audience, such as might be supposed capable of comprehending his arguments.
      <br>&emsp;The matter would not be difficult, upon such conditions, replied he: And if you please, I shall suppose myself Epicurus for a moment, and make you stand for the Athenian people, and shall deliver you such an harangue as will fill all the urn with white beans, and leave not a black one to gratify the malice of my adversaries.
      <br>&emsp;Very well: Pray proceed upon these suppositions.
      <br>&emsp;I come hither, O ye Athenians, to justify in your assembly what I maintained in my school, and I find myself impeached by furious antagonists, instead of reasoning with calm and dispassionate enquirers. Your deliberations, which of right should be directed to questions of public good, and the interest of the commonwealth, are diverted to the disquisitions of speculative philosophy; and these magnificent, but perhaps fruitless enquiries, take place of your more familiar but more useful occupations. But so far as in me lies, I will prevent this abuse. We shall not here dispute concerning the origin and government of worlds. We shall only enquire how far such questions concern the public interest. And if I can persuade you, that they are entirely indifferent to the peace of society and security of government, I hope that you will presently send us back to our schools, there to examine, at leisure, the question, the most sublime, but, at the same time, the most speculative of all philosophy.
      <br>&emsp;The religious philosophers, not satisfied with the tradition of your forefathers, and doctrine of your priests (in which I willingly acquiesce), indulge a rash curiosity, in trying how far they can establish religion upon the principles of reason; and they thereby excite, instead of satisfying, the doubts, which naturally arise from a diligent and scrutinous enquiry. They paint, in the most magnificent colours, the order, beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and then ask, if such a glorious display of intelligence could proceed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms, or if chance could produce what the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire. I shall not examine the justness of this argument. I shall allow it to be as solid as my antagonists and accusers can desire. It is sufficient, if I can prove, from this very reasoning, that the question is entirely speculative, and that, when, in my philosophical disquisitions, I deny a providence and a future state, I undermine not the foundations of society, but advance principles, which they themselves, upon their own topics, if they argue consistently, must allow to be solid and satisfactory.
      <br>&emsp;You then, who are my accusers, have acknowledged, that the chief or sole argument for a divine existence (which I never questioned) is derived from the order of nature; where there appear such marks of intelligence and design, that you think it extravagant to assign for its cause, either chance, or the blind and unguided force of matter. You allow, that this is an argument drawn from effects to causes. From the order of the work, you infer, that there must have been project and forethought in the workman. If you cannot make out this point, you allow, that your conclusion fails; and you pretend not to establish the conclusion in a greater latitude than the phænomena of nature will justify. These are your concessions. I desire you to mark the consequences.
      <br>&emsp;When we infer any particular cause from an effect, we must proportion the one to the other, and can never be allowed to ascribe to the cause any qualities, but what are exactly sufficient to produce the effect. A body of ten ounces raised in any scale may serve as a proof, that the counterbalancing weight exceeds ten ounces; but can never afford a reason that it exceeds a hundred. If the cause, assigned for any effect, be not sufficient to produce it, we must either reject that cause, or add to it such qualities as will give it a just proportion to the effect. But if we ascribe to it farther qualities, or affirm it capable of producing other effects, we can only indulge the licence of conjecture, and arbitrarily suppose the existence of qualities and energies, without reason or authority.
      <br>&emsp;The same rule holds, whether the cause assigned be brute unconscious matter, or a rational intelligent being. If the cause be known only by the effect, we never ought to ascribe to it any qualities, beyond what are precisely requisite to produce the effect: Nor can we, by any rules of just reasoning, return back from the cause, and infer other effects from it, beyond those by which alone it is known to us. No one, merely from the sight of one of Zeuxis's pictures, could know, that he was also a statuary or architect, and was an artist no less skilful in stone and marble than in colours. The talents and taste, displayed in the particular work before us; these we may safely conclude the workman to be possessed of. The cause must be proportioned to the effect; and if we exactly and precisely proportion it, we shall never find in it any qualities, that point farther, or afford an inference concerning any other design or performance. Such qualities must be somewhat beyond what is merely requisite for producing the effect, which we examine.
      <br>&emsp;Allowing, therefore, the gods to be the authors of the existence or order of the universe; it follows, that they possess that precise degree of power, intelligence, and benevolence, which appears in their workmanship; but nothing farther can ever be proved, except we call in the assistance of exaggeration and flattery to supply the defects of argument and reasoning. So far as the traces of any attributes, at present, appear, so far may we conclude these attributes to exist. The supposition of farther attributes is mere hypothesis; much more the supposition, that, in distant regions of space or periods of time, there has been, or will be, a more magnificent display of these attributes, and a scheme of administration more suitable to such imaginary virtues. We can never be allowed to mount up from the universe, the effect, to Jupiter, the cause; and then descend downwards, to infer any new effect from that cause; as if the present effects alone were not entirely worthy of the glorious attributes, which we ascribe to that deity. The knowledge of the cause being derived solely from the effect, they must be exactly adjusted to each other; and the one can never refer to any thing farther, or be the foundation of any new inference and conclusion.
      <br>&emsp;You find certain phænomena in nature. You seek a cause or author. You imagine that you have found him. You afterwards become so enamoured of this offspring of your brain, that you imagine it impossible, but he must produce something greater and more perfect than the present scene of things, which is so full of ill and disorder. You forget, that this superlative intelligence and benevolence are entirely imaginary, or, at least, without any foundation in reason; and that you have no ground to ascribe to him any qualities, but what you see he has actually exerted and displayed in his productions. Let your gods, therefore, O philosophers, be suited to the present appearances of nature: And presume not to alter these appearances by arbitrary suppositions, in order to suit them to the attributes, which you so fondly ascribe to your deities.
      <br>&emsp;When priests and poets, supported by your authority, O Athenians, talk of a golden or silver age, which preceded the present state of vice and misery, I hear them with attention and with reverence. But when philosophers, who pretend to neglect authority, and to cultivate reason, hold the same discourse, I pay them not, I own, the same obsequious submission and pious deference. I ask; who carried them into the celestial regions, who admitted them into the councils of the gods, who opened to them the book of fate, that they thus rashly affirm, that their deities have executed, or will execute, any purpose beyond what has actually appeared? If they tell me, that they have mounted on the steps or by the gradual ascent of reason, and by drawing inferences from effects to causes, I still insist, that they have aided the ascent of reason by the wings of imagination; otherwise they could not thus change their manner of inference, and argue from causes to effects; presuming, that a more perfect production than the present world would be more suitable to such perfect beings as the gods, and forgetting that they have no reason to ascribe to these celestial beings any perfection or any attribute, but what can be found in the present world.
      <br>&emsp;Hence all the fruitless industry to account for the ill appearances of nature, and save the honour of the gods; while we must acknowledge the reality of that evil and disorder, with which the world so much abounds. The obstinate and intractable qualities of matter, we are told, or the observance of general laws, or some such reason, is the sole cause, which controlled the power and benevolence of Jupiter, and obliged him to create mankind and every sensible creature so imperfect and so unhappy. These attributes, then, are, it seems, beforehand, taken for granted, in their greatest latitude. And upon that supposition, I own, that such conjectures may, perhaps, be admitted as plausible solutions of the ill phænomena. But still I ask; Why take these attributes for granted, or why ascribe to the cause any qualities but what actually appear in the effect? Why torture your brain to justify the course of nature upon suppositions, which, for aught you know, may be entirely imaginary, and of which there are to be found no traces in the course of nature?
      <br>&emsp;The religious hypothesis, therefore, must be considered only as a particular method of accounting for the visible phænomena of the universe: But no just reasoner will ever presume to infer from it any single fact, and alter or add to the phænomena, in any single particular. If you think, that the appearances of things prove such causes, it is allowable for you to draw an inference concerning the existence of these causes. In such complicated and sublime subjects, every one should be indulged in the liberty of conjecture and argument. But here you ought to rest. If you come backward, and arguing from your inferred causes, conclude, that any other fact has existed, or will exist, in the course of nature, which may serve as a fuller display of particular attributes; I must admonish you, that you have departed from the method of reasoning, attached to the present subject, and have certainly added something to the attributes of the cause, beyond what appears in the effect; otherwise you could never, with tolerable sense or propriety, add any thing to the effect, in order to render it more worthy of the cause.
      <br>&emsp;Where, then, is the odiousness of that doctrine, which I teach in my school, or rather, which I examine in my gardens? Or what do you find in this whole question, wherein the security of good morals, or the peace and order of society is in the least concerned?
      <br>&emsp;I deny a providence, you say, and supreme governour of the world, who guides the course of events, and punishes the vicious with infamy and disappointment, and rewards the virtuous with honour and success, in all their undertakings. But surely, I deny not the course itself of events, which lies open to every one's enquiry and examination. I acknowledge, that, in the present order of things, virtue is attended with more peace of mind than vice, and meets with a more favourable reception from the world. I am sensible, that, according to the past experience of mankind, friendship is the chief joy of human life, and moderation the only source of tranquillity and happiness. I never balance between the virtuous and the vicious course of life; but am sensible, that, to a well disposed mind, every advantage is on the side of the former. And what can you say more, allowing all your suppositions and reasonings? You tell me, indeed, that this disposition of things proceeds from intelligence and design. But whatever it proceeds from, the disposition itself, on which depends our happiness or misery, and consequently our conduct and deportment in life, is still the same. It is still open for me, as well as you, to regulate my behaviour, by my experience of past events. And if you affirm, that, while a divine providence is allowed, and a supreme distributive justice in the universe, I ought to expect some more particular reward of the good, and punishment of the bad, beyond the ordinary course of events; I here find the same fallacy, which I have before endeavoured to detect. You persist in imagining, that, if we grant that divine existence, for which you so earnestly contend, you may safely infer consequences from it, and add something to the experienced order of nature, by arguing from the attributes which you ascribe to your gods. You seem not to remember, that all your reasonings on this subject can only be drawn from effects to causes; and that every argument, deduced from causes to effects, must of necessity be a gross sophism; since it is impossible for you to know any thing of the cause, but what you have antecedently, not inferred, but discovered to the full, in the effect.
      <br>&emsp;But what must a philosopher think of those vain reasoners, who, instead of regarding the present scene of things as the sole object of their contemplation, so far reverse the whole course of nature, as to render this life merely a passage to something farther; a porch, which leads to a greater, and vastly different building; a prologue, which serves only to introduce the piece, and give it more grace and propriety? Whence, do you think, can such philosophers derive their idea of the gods? From their own conceit and imagination surely. For if they derived it from the present phænomena, it would never point to any thing farther, but must be exactly adjusted to them. That the divinity may possibly be endowed with attributes, which we have never seen exerted; may be governed by principles of action, which we cannot discover to be satisfied: All this will freely be allowed. But still this is mere possibility and hypothesis. We never can have reason to infer any attributes, or any principles of action in him, but so far as we know them to have been exerted and satisfied.
      <br>&emsp;Are there any marks of a distributive justice in the world? If you answer in the affirmative, I conclude, that, since justice here exerts itself, it is satisfied. If you reply in the negative, I conclude, that you have then no reason to ascribe justice, in our sense of it, to the gods. If you hold a medium between affirmation and negation, by saying, that the justice of the gods, at present, exerts itself in part, but not in its full extent; I answer, that you have no reason to give it any particular extent, but only so far as you see it, at present, exert itself.
      <br>&emsp;Thus I bring the dispute, O Athenians, to a short issue with my antagonists. The course of nature lies open to my contemplation as well as to theirs. The experienced train of events is the great standard, by which we all regulate our conduct. Nothing else can be appealed to in the field, or in the senate. Nothing else ought ever to be heard of in the school, or in the closet. In vain would our limited understanding break through those boundaries, which are too narrow for our fond imagination. While we argue from the course of nature, and infer a particular intelligent cause, which first bestowed, and still preserves order in the universe, we embrace a principle, which is both uncertain and useless. It is uncertain; because the subject lies entirely beyond the reach of human experience. It is useless; because our knowledge of this cause being derived entirely from the course of nature, we can never, according to the rules of just reasoning, return back from the cause with any new inference, or making additions to the common and experienced course of nature, establish any new principles of conduct and behaviour.
      <br>&emsp;I observe (said I, finding he had finished his harangue) that you neglect not the artifice of the demagogues of old; and as you were pleased to make me stand for the people, you insinuate yourself into my favour by embracing those principles, to which, you know, I have always expressed a particular attachment. But allowing you to make experience (as indeed I think you ought) the only standard of our judgment concerning this, and all other questions of fact; I doubt not but, from the very same experience, to which you appeal, it may be possible to refute this reasoning, which you have put into the mouth of Epicurus. If you saw, for instance, a half-finished building, surrounded with heaps of brick and stone and mortar, and all the instruments of masonry; could you not infer from the effect, that it was a work of design and contrivance? And could you not return again, from this inferred cause, to infer new additions to the effect, and conclude, that the building would soon be finished, and receive all the further improvements, which art could bestow upon it? If you saw upon the sea-shore the print of one human foot, you would conclude, that a man had passed that way, and that he had also left the traces of the other foot, though effaced by the rolling of the sands or inundation of the waters. Why then do you refuse to admit the same method of reasoning with regard to the order of nature? Consider the world and the present life only as an imperfect building, from which you can infer a superior intelligence; and arguing from that superior intelligence, which can leave nothing imperfect; why may you not infer a more finished scheme or plan, which will receive its completion in some distant point of space or time? Are not these methods of reasoning exactly similar? And under what pretence can you embrace the one, while you reject the other?
      <br>&emsp;The infinite difference of the subjects, replied he, is a sufficient foundation for this difference in my conclusions. In works of human art and contrivance, it is allowable to advance from the effect to the cause, and returning back from the cause, to form new inferences concerning the effect, and examine the alterations, which it has probably undergone, or may still undergo. But what is the foundation of this method of reasoning? Plainly this; that man is a being, whom we know by experience, whose motives and designs we are acquainted with, and whose projects and inclinations have a certain connexion and coherence, according to the laws which nature has established for the government of such a creature. When, therefore, we find, that any work has proceeded from the skill and industry of man; as we are otherwise acquainted with the nature of the animal, we can draw a hundred inferences concerning what may be expected from him; and these inferences will all be founded in experience and observation. But did we know man only from the single work or production which we examine, it were impossible for us to argue in this manner; because our knowledge of all the qualities, which we ascribe to him, being in that case derived from the production, it is impossible they could point to any thing farther, or be the foundation of any new inference. The print of a foot in the sand can only prove, when considered alone, that there was some figure adapted to it, by which it was produced: But the print of a human foot proves likewise, from our other experience, that there was probably another foot, which also left its impression, though effaced by time or other accidents. Here we mount from the effect to the cause; and descending again from the cause, infer alterations in the effect; but this is not a continuation of the same simple chain of reasoning. We comprehend in this case a hundred other experiences and observations, concerning the usual figure and members of that species of animal, without which this method of argument must be considered as fallacious and sophistical.
      <br>&emsp;The case is not the same with our reasonings from the works of nature. The Deity is known to us only by his productions, and is a single being in the universe, not comprehended under any species or genus, from whose experienced attributes or qualities, we can, by analogy, infer any attribute or quality in him. As the universe shews wisdom and goodness, we infer wisdom and goodness. As it shews a particular degree of these perfections, we infer a particular degree of them, precisely adapted to the effect which we examine. But farther attributes or farther degrees of the same attributes, we can never be authorised to infer or suppose, by any rules of just reasoning. Now, without some such licence of supposition, it is impossible for us to argue from the cause, or infer any alteration in the effect, beyond what has immediately fallen under our observation. Greater good produced by this Being must still prove a greater degree of goodness: A more impartial distribution of rewards and punishments must proceed from a greater regard to justice and equity. Every supposed addition to the works of nature makes an addition to the attributes of the Author of nature; and consequently, being entirely unsupported by any reason or argument, can never be admitted but as mere conjecture and hypothesis.
      <br>&emsp;The great source of our mistake in this subject, and of the unbounded licence of conjecture, which we indulge, is, that we tacitly consider ourselves, as in the place of the Supreme Being, and conclude, that he will, on every occasion, observe the same conduct, which we ourselves, in his situation, would have embraced as reasonable and eligible. But, besides that the ordinary course of nature may convince us, that almost every thing is regulated by principles and maxims very different from ours; besides this, I say, it must evidently appear contrary to all rules of analogy to reason, from the intentions and projects of men, to those of a Being so different, and so much superior. In human nature, there is a certain experienced coherence of designs and inclinations; so that when, from any fact, we have discovered one intention of any man, it may often be reasonable, from experience, to infer another, and draw a long chain of conclusions concerning his past or future conduct. But this method of reasoning can never have place with regard to a Being, so remote and incomprehensible, who bears much less analogy to any other being in the universe than the sun to a waxen taper, and who discovers himself only by some faint traces or outlines, beyond which we have no authority to ascribe to him any attribute or perfection. What we imagine to be a superior perfection, may really be a defect. Or were it ever so much a perfection, the ascribing of it to the Supreme Being, where it appears not to have been really exerted, to the full, in his works, savours more of flattery and panegyric, than of just reasoning and sound philosophy. All the philosophy, therefore, in the world, and all the religion, which is nothing but a species of philosophy, will never be able to carry us beyond the usual course of experience, or give us measures of conduct and behaviour different from those which are furnished by reflections on common life. No new fact can ever be inferred from the religious hypothesis; no event foreseen or foretold; no reward or punishment expected or dreaded, beyond what is already known by practice and observation. So that my apology for Epicurus will still appear solid and satisfactory; nor have the political interests of society any connexion with the philosophical disputes concerning metaphysics and religion.
      <br>&emsp;There is still one circumstance, replied I, which you seem to have overlooked. Though I should allow your premises, I must deny your conclusion. You conclude, that religious doctrines and reasonings can have no influence on life, because they ought to have no influence; never considering, that men reason not in the same manner you do, but draw many consequences from the belief of a divine Existence, and suppose that the Deity will inflict punishments on vice, and bestow rewards on virtue, beyond what appear in the ordinary course of nature. Whether this reasoning of theirs be just or not, is no matter. Its influence on their life and conduct must still be the same. And, those, who attempt to disabuse them of such prejudices, may, for aught I know, be good reasoners, but I cannot allow them to be good citizens and politicians; since they free men from one restraint upon their passions, and make the infringement of the laws of society, in one respect, more easy and secure.
      <br>&emsp;After all, I may, perhaps, agree to your general conclusion in favour of liberty, though upon different premises from those, on which you endeavour to found it. I think, that the state ought to tolerate every principle of philosophy; nor is there an instance, that any government has suffered in its political interests by such indulgence. There is no enthusiasm among philosophers; their doctrines are not very alluring to the people; and no restraint can be put upon their reasonings, but what must be of dangerous consequence to the sciences, and even to the state, by paving the way for persecution and oppression in points, where the generality of mankind are more deeply interested and concerned.
      <br>&emsp;But there occurs to me (continued I) with regard to your main topic, a difficulty, which I shall just propose to you, without insisting on it; lest it lead into reasonings of too nice and delicate a nature. In a word, I much doubt whether it be possible for a cause to be known only by its effect (as you have all along supposed) or to be of so singular and particular a nature as to have no parallel and no similarity with any other cause or object, that has ever fallen under our observation. It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other; and were an effect presented, which was entirely singular, and could not be comprehended under any known species, I do not see, that we could form any conjecture or inference at all concerning its cause. If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inferences of this nature; both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects and causes, which we know, and which we have found, in many instances, to be conjoined with each other. I leave it to your own reflection to pursue the consequences of this principle. I shall just observe, that, as the antagonists of Epicurus always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled; your reasonings, upon that supposition, seem, at least, to merit our attention. There is, I own, some difficulty, how we can ever return from the cause to the effect, and, reasoning from our ideas of the former, infer any alteration on the latter, or any addition to it.

      There is not a greater number of philosophical reasonings, displayed upon any subject, than those, which prove the existence of a Deity, and refute the fallacies of Atheists; and yet the most religious philosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist. How shall we reconcile these contradictions? The knights-errant, who wandered about to clear the world of dragons and giants, never entertained the least doubt with regard to the existence of these monsters.
      <br>&emsp;The Sceptic is another enemy of religion, who naturally provokes the indignation of all divines and graver philosophers; though it is certain, that no man ever met with any such absurd creature, or conversed with a man, who had no opinion or principle concerning any subject, either of action or speculation. This begets a very natural question; What is meant by a sceptic? And how far it is possible to push these philosophical principles of doubt and uncertainty?
      <br>&emsp;There is a species of scepticism, antecedent to all study and philosophy, which is much inculcated by Des Cartes and others, as a sovereign preservative against error and precipitate judgment. It recommends an universal doubt, not only of all our former opinions and principles, but also of our very faculties; of whose veracity, say they, we must assure ourselves, by a chain of reasoning, deduced from some original principle, which cannot possibly be fallacious or deceitful. But neither is there any such original principle, which has a prerogative above others, that are self-evident and convincing: Or if there were, could we advance a step beyond it, but by the use of those very faculties, of which we are supposed to be already diffident. The Cartesian doubt, therefore, were it ever possible to be attained by any human creature (as it plainly is not) would be entirely incurable; and no reasoning could ever bring us to a state of assurance and conviction upon any subject.
      <br>&emsp;It must, however, be confessed, that this species of scepticism, when more moderate, may be understood in a very reasonable sense, and is a necessary preparative to the study of philosophy, by preserving a proper impartiality in our judgments, and weaning our mind from all those prejudices, which we may have imbibed from education or rash opinion. To begin with clear and self-evident principles, to advance by timorous and sure steps, to review frequently our conclusions, and examine accurately all their consequences; though by these means we shall make both a slow and a short progress in our systems; are the only methods, by which we can ever hope to reach truth, and attain a proper stability and certainty in our determinations.
      <br>&emsp;There is another species of scepticism, consequent to science and enquiry, when men are supposed to have discovered, either the absolute fallaciousness of their mental faculties, or their unfitness to reach any fixed determination in all those curious subjects of speculation, about which they are commonly employed. Even our very senses are brought into dispute, by a certain species of philosophers; and the maxims of common life are subjected to the same doubt as the most profound principles or conclusions of metaphysics and theology. As these paradoxical tenets (if they may be called tenets) are to be met with in some philosophers, and the refutation of them in several, they naturally excite our curiosity, and make us enquire into the arguments, on which they may be founded.
      <br>&emsp;I need not insist upon the more trite topics, employed by the sceptics in all ages, against the evidence of sense; such as those which are derived from the imperfection and fallaciousness of our organs, on numberless occasions; the crooked appearance of an oar in water; the various aspects of objects, according to their different distances; the double images which arise from the pressing one eye; with many other appearances of a like nature. These sceptical topics, indeed, are only sufficient to prove, that the senses alone are not implicitly to be depended on; but that we must correct their evidence by reason, and by considerations, derived from the nature of the medium, the distance of the object, and the disposition of the organ, in order to render them, within their sphere, the proper criteria of truth and falsehood. There are other more profound arguments against the senses, which admit not of so easy a solution.
      <br>&emsp;It seems evident, that men are carried, by a natural instinct or prepossession, to repose faith in their senses; and that, without any reasoning, or even almost before the use of reason, we always suppose an external universe, which depends not on our perception, but would exist, though we and every sensible creature were absent or annihilated. Even the animal creation are governed by a like opinion, and preserve this belief of external objects, in all their thoughts, designs, and actions.
      <br>&emsp;It seems also evident, that, when men follow this blind and powerful instinct of nature, they always suppose the very images, presented by the senses, to be the external objects, and never entertain any suspicion, that the one are nothing but representations of the other. This very table, which we see white, and which we feel hard, is believed to exist, independent of our perception, and to be something external to our mind, which perceives it. Our presence bestows not being on it: Our absence does not annihilate it. It preserves its existence uniform and entire, independent of the situation of intelligent beings, who perceive or contemplate it.
      <br>&emsp;But this universal and primary opinion of all men is soon destroyed by the slightest philosophy, which teaches us, that nothing can ever be present to the mind but an image or perception, and that the senses are only the inlets, through which these images are conveyed, without being able to produce any immediate intercourse between the mind and the object. The table, which we see, seems to diminish, as we remove farther from it: But the real table, which exists independent of us, suffers no alteration: It was, therefore, nothing but its image, which was present to the mind. These are the obvious dictates of reason; and no man, who reflects, ever doubted, that the existences, which we consider, when we say, this house and that tree, are nothing but perceptions in the mind, and fleeting copies or representations of other existences, which remain uniform and independent.
      <br>&emsp;So far, then, are we necessitated by reasoning to contradict or depart from the primary instincts of nature, and to embrace a new system with regard to the evidence of our senses. But here philosophy finds herself extremely embarrassed, when she would justify this new system, and obviate the cavils and objections of the sceptics. She can no longer plead the infallible and irresistible instinct of nature: For that led us to a quite different system, which is acknowledged fallible and even erroneous. And to justify this pretended philosophical system, by a chain of clear and convincing argument, or even any appearance of argument, exceeds the power of all human capacity.
      <br>&emsp;By what argument can it be proved, that the perceptions of the mind must be caused by external objects, entirely different from them, though resembling them (if that be possible) and could not arise either from the energy of the mind itself, or from the suggestion of some invisible and unknown spirit, or from some other cause still more unknown to us? It is acknowledged, that, in fact, many of these perceptions arise not from any thing external, as in dreams, madness, and other diseases. And nothing can be more inexplicable than the manner, in which body should so operate upon mind as ever to convey an image of itself to a substance, supposed of so different, and even contrary a nature.
      <br>&emsp;It is a question of fact, whether the perceptions of the senses be produced by external objects, resembling them: How shall this question be determined? By experience surely; as all other questions of a like nature. But here experience is, and must be entirely silent. The mind has never any thing present to it but the perceptions, and cannot possibly reach any experience of their connexion with objects. The supposition of such a connexion is, therefore, without any foundation in reasoning.
      <br>&emsp;To have recourse to the veracity of the supreme Being, in order to prove the veracity of our senses, is surely making a very unexpected circuit. If his veracity were at all concerned in this matter, our senses would be entirely infallible; because it is not possible that he can ever deceive. Not to mention, that, if the external world be once called in question, we shall be at a loss to find arguments, by which we may prove the existence of that Being or any of his attributes.
      <br>&emsp;This is a topic, therefore, in which the profounder and more philosophical sceptics will always triumph, when they endeavour to introduce an universal doubt into all subjects of human knowledge and enquiry. Do you follow the instincts and propensities of nature, may they say, in assenting to the veracity of sense? But these lead you to believe, that the very perception or sensible image is the external object. Do you disclaim this principle, in order to embrace a more rational opinion, that the perceptions are only representations of something external? You here depart from your natural propensities and more obvious sentiments; and yet are not able to satisfy your reason, which can never find any convincing argument from experience to prove, that the perceptions are connected with any external objects.
      <br>&emsp;There is another sceptical topic of a like nature, derived from the most profound philosophy; which might merit our attention, were it requisite to dive so deep, in order to discover arguments and reasonings, which can so little serve to any serious purpose. It is universally allowed by modern enquirers, that all the sensible qualities of objects, such as hard, soft, hot, cold, white, black, &c. are merely secondary, and exist not in the objects themselves, but are perceptions of the mind, without any external archetype or model, which they represent. If this be allowed, with regard to secondary qualities, it must also follow, with regard to the supposed primary qualities of extension and solidity; nor can the latter be any more entitled to that denomination than the former. The idea of extension is entirely acquired from the senses of sight and feeling; and if all the qualities, perceived by the senses, be in the mind, not in the object, the same conclusion must reach the idea of extension, which is wholly dependent on the sensible ideas or the ideas of secondary qualities. Nothing can save us from this conclusion, but the asserting, that the ideas of those primary qualities are attained by Abstraction; an opinion, which, if we examine it accurately, we shall find to be unintelligible, and even absurd. An extension, that is neither tangible nor visible, cannot possibly be conceived: And a tangible or visible extension, which is neither hard nor soft, black nor white, is equally beyond the reach of human conception. Let any man try to conceive a triangle in general, which is neither Isosceles nor Scalenum, nor has any particular length or proportion of sides; and he will soon perceive the absurdity of all the scholastic notions with regard to abstraction and general ideas.
      <br>&emsp;Thus the first philosophical objection to the evidence of sense or to the opinion of external existence consists in this, that such an opinion, if rested on natural instinct, is contrary to reason, and if referred to reason, is contrary to natural instinct, and at the same time carries no rational evidence with it, to convince an impartial enquirer. The second objection goes farther, and represents this opinion as contrary to reason: at least, if it be a principle of reason, that all sensible qualities are in the mind, not in the object. Bereave matter of all its intelligible qualities, both primary and secondary, you in a manner annihilate it, and leave only a certain unknown, inexplicable something, as the cause of our perceptions; a notion so imperfect, that no sceptic will think it worth while to contend against it.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden" id="acadmeicPhilosophy2">
      It may seem a very extravagant attempt of the sceptics to destroy reason by argument and ratiocination; yet is this the grand scope of all their enquiries and disputes. They endeavour to find objections, both to our abstract reasonings, and to those which regard matter of fact and existence.
      <br>&emsp;The chief objection against all abstract reasonings is derived from the ideas of space and time; ideas, which, in common life and to a careless view, are very clear and intelligible, but when they pass through the scrutiny of the profound sciences (and they are the chief object of these sciences) afford principles, which seem full of absurdity and contradiction. No priestly dogmas, invented on purpose to tame and subdue the rebellious reason of mankind, ever shocked common sense more than the doctrine of the infinite divisibility of extension, with its consequences; as they are pompously displayed by all geometricians and metaphysicians, with a kind of triumph and exultation. A real quantity, infinitely less than any finite quantity, containing quantities infinitely less than itself, and so on in infinitum; this is an edifice so bold and prodigious, that it is too weighty for any pretended demonstration to support, because it shocks the clearest and most natural principles of human reason. But what renders the matter more extraordinary, is, that these seemingly absurd opinions are supported by a chain of reasoning, the clearest and most natural; nor is it possible for us to allow the premises without admitting the consequences. Nothing can be more convincing and satisfactory than all the conclusions concerning the properties of circles and triangles; and yet, when these are once received, how can we deny, that the angle of contact between a circle and its tangent is infinitely less than any rectilineal angle, that as you may increase the diameter of the circle in infinitum, this angle of contact becomes still less, even in infinitum, and that the angle of contact between other curves and their tangents may be infinitely less than those between any circle and its tangent, and so on, in infinitum? The demonstration of these principles seems as unexceptionable as that which proves the three angles of a triangle to be equal to two right ones, though the latter opinion be natural and easy, and the former big with contradiction and absurdity. Reason here seems to be thrown into a kind of amazement and suspence, which, without the suggestions of any sceptic, gives her a diffidence of herself, and of the ground on which she treads. She sees a full light, which illuminates certain places; but that light borders upon the most profound darkness. And between these she is so dazzled and confounded, that she scarcely can pronounce with certainty and assurance concerning any one object.
      <br>&emsp;The absurdity of these bold determinations of the abstract sciences seems to become, if possible, still more palpable with regard to time than extension. An infinite number of real parts of time, passing in succession, and exhausted one after another, appears so evident a contradiction, that no man, one should think, whose judgment is not corrupted, instead of being improved, by the sciences, would ever be able to admit of it.
      <br>&emsp;Yet still reason must remain restless, and unquiet, even with regard to that scepticism, to which she is driven by these seeming absurdities and contradictions. How any clear, distinct idea can contain circumstances, contradictory to itself, or to any other clear, distinct idea, is absolutely incomprehensible; and is, perhaps, as absurd as any proposition, which can be formed. So that nothing can be more sceptical, or more full of doubt and hesitation, than this scepticism itself, which arises from some of the paradoxical conclusions of geometry or the science of quantity.
      <br>&emsp;The sceptical objections to moral evidence, or to the reasonings concerning matter of fact, are either popular or philosophical. The popular objections are derived from the natural weakness of human understanding; the contradictory opinions, which have been entertained in different ages and nations; the variations of our judgment in sickness and health, youth and old age, prosperity and adversity; the perpetual contradiction of each particular man's opinions and sentiments; with many other topics of that kind. It is needless to insist farther on this head. These objections are but weak. For as, in common life, we reason every moment concerning fact and existence, and cannot possibly subsist, without continually employing this species of argument, any popular objections, derived from thence, must be insufficient to destroy that evidence. The great subverter of Pyrrhonism or the excessive principles of scepticism, is action, and employment, and the occupations of common life. These principles may flourish and triumph in the schools; where it is, indeed, difficult, if not impossible, to refute them. But as soon as they leave the shade, and by the presence of the real objects, which actuate our passions and sentiments, are put in opposition to the more powerful principles of our nature, they vanish like smoke, and leave the most determined sceptic in the same condition as other mortals.
      <br>&emsp;The sceptic, therefore, had better keep within his proper sphere, and display those philosophical objections, which arise from more profound researches. Here he seems to have ample matter of triumph; while he justly insists, that all our evidence for any matter of fact, which lies beyond the testimony of sense or memory, is derived entirely from the relation of cause and effect; that we have no other idea of this relation than that of two objects, which have been frequently conjoined together; that we have no argument to convince us, that objects, which have, in our experience, been frequently conjoined, will likewise, in other instances, be conjoined in the same manner; and that nothing leads us to this inference but custom or a certain instinct of our nature; which it is indeed difficult to resist, but which, like other instincts, may be fallacious and deceitful. While the sceptic insists upon these topics, he shews his force, or rather, indeed, his own and our weakness; and seems, for the time at least, to destroy all assurance and conviction. These arguments might be displayed at greater length, if any durable good or benefit to society could ever be expected to result from them.
      <br>&emsp;For here is the chief and most confounding objection to excessive scepticism, that no durable good can ever result from it; while it remains in its full force and vigour. We need only ask such a sceptic, What his meaning is? And what he proposes by all these curious researches? He is immediately at a loss, and knows not what to answer. A Copernican or Ptolemaic, who supports each his different system of astronomy, may hope to produce a conviction, which will remain constant and durable, with his audience. A Stoic or Epicurean displays principles, which may not only be durable, but which have an effect on conduct and behaviour. But a Pyrrhonian cannot expect, that his philosophy will have any constant influence on the mind: Or if it had, that its influence would be beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must acknowledge, if he will acknowledge any thing, that all human life must perish, were his principles universally and steadily to prevail. All discourse, all action would immediately cease; and men remain in a total lethargy, till the necessities of nature, unsatisfied, put an end to their miserable existence. It is true; so fatal an event is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always too strong for principle. And though a Pyrrhonian may throw himself or others into a momentary amazement and confusion by his profound reasonings; the first and most trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubts and scruples, and leave him the same, in every point of action and speculation, with the philosophers of every other sect, or with those who never concerned themselves in any philosophical researches. When he awakes from his dream, he will be the first to join in the laugh against himself, and to confess, that all his objections are mere amusement, and can have no other tendency than to show the whimsical condition of mankind, who must act and reason and believe; though they are not able, by their most diligent enquiry, to satisfy themselves concerning the foundation of these operations, or to remove the objections, which may be raised against them.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden" id="academicphilosphy3">
      There is, indeed, a more mitigated scepticism or academical philosophy, which may be both durable and useful, and which may, in part, be the result of this Pyrrhonism, or excessive scepticism, when its undistinguished doubts are, in some measure, corrected by common sense and reflection. The greater part of mankind are naturally apt to be affirmative and dogmatical in their opinions; and while they see objects only on one side, and have no idea of any counterpoising argument, they throw themselves precipitately into the principles, to which they are inclined; nor have they any indulgence for those who entertain opposite sentiments. To hesitate or balance perplexes their understanding, checks their passion, and suspends their action. They are, therefore, impatient till they escape from a state, which to them is so uneasy; and they think, that they can never remove themselves far enough from it, by the violence of their affirmations and obstinacy of their belief. But could such dogmatical reasoners become sensible of the strange infirmities of human understanding, even in its most perfect state, and when most accurate and cautious in its determinations; such a reflection would naturally inspire them with more modesty and reserve, and diminish their fond opinion of themselves, and their prejudice against antagonists. The illiterate may reflect on the disposition of the learned, who, amidst all the advantages of study and reflection, are commonly still diffident in their determinations: And if any of the learned be inclined, from their natural temper, to haughtiness and obstinacy, a small tincture of Pyrrhonism might abate their pride, by shewing them, that the few advantages, which they may have attained over their fellows, are but inconsiderable, if compared with the universal perplexity and confusion, which is inherent in human nature. In general, there is a degree of doubt, and caution, and modesty, which, in all kinds of scrutiny and decision, ought for ever to accompany a just reasoner.
      <br>&emsp;Another species of mitigated scepticism, which may be of advantage to mankind, and which may be the natural result of the Pyrrhonian doubts and scruples, is the limitation of our enquiries to such subjects as are best adapted to the narrow capacity of human understanding. The imagination of man is naturally sublime, delighted with whatever is remote and extraordinary, and running, without controul, into the most distant parts of space and time in order to avoid the objects, which custom has rendered too familiar to it. A correct Judgment observes a contrary method, and avoiding all distant and high enquiries, confines itself to common life, and to such subjects as fall under daily practice and experience; leaving the more sublime topics to the embellishment of poets and orators, or to the arts of priests and politicians. To bring us to so salutary a determination, nothing can be more serviceable, than to be once thoroughly convinced of the force of the Pyrrhonian doubt, and of the impossibility, that any thing, but the strong power of natural instinct, could free us from it. Those who have a propensity to philosophy, will still continue their researches; because they reflect, that, besides the immediate pleasure, attending such an occupation, philosophical decisions are nothing but the reflections of common life, methodized and corrected. But they will never be tempted to go beyond common life, so long as they consider the imperfection of those faculties which they employ, their narrow reach, and their inaccurate operations. While we cannot give a satisfactory reason, why we believe, after a thousand experiments, that a stone will fall, or fire burn; can we ever satisfy ourselves concerning any determination, which we may form, with regard to the origin of worlds, and the situation of nature, from, and to eternity?
      <br>&emsp;This narrow limitation, indeed, of our enquiries, is, in every respect, so reasonable, that it suffices to make the slightest examination into the natural powers of the human mind, and to compare them with their objects, in order to recommend it to us. We shall then find what are the proper subjects of science and enquiry.
      <br>&emsp;It seems to me, that the only objects of the abstract sciences or of demonstration are quantity and number, and that all attempts to extend this more perfect species of knowledge beyond these bounds are mere sophistry and illusion. As the component parts of quantity and number are entirely similar, their relations become intricate and involved; and nothing can be more curious, as well as useful, than to trace, by a variety of mediums, their equality or inequality, through their different appearances. But as all other ideas are clearly distinct and different from each other, we can never advance farther, by our outmost scrutiny, than to observe this diversity, and, by an obvious reflection, pronounce one thing not to be another. Or if there be any difficulty in these decisions, it proceeds entirely from the undeterminate meaning of words, which is corrected by juster definitions. That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides, cannot be known, let the terms be ever so exactly defined, without a train of reasoning and enquiry. But to convince us of this proposition, that where there is no property, there can be no injustice, it is only necessary to define the terms, and explain injustice to be a violation of property. This proposition is, indeed, nothing but a more imperfect definition. It is the same case with all those pretended syllogistical reasonings, which may be found in every other branch of learning, except the sciences of quantity and number; and these may safely, I think, be pronounced the only proper objects of knowledge and demonstration.
      <br>&emsp;All other enquiries of men regard only matter of fact and existence; and these are evidently incapable of demonstration. Whatever is may not be. No negation of a fact can involve a contradiction. The non-existence of any being, without exception, is as clear and distinct an idea as its existence. The proposition, which affirms it not to be, however false, is no less conceivable and intelligible, than that which affirms it to be. The case is different with the sciences, properly so called. Every proposition, which is not true, is there confused and unintelligible. That the cube root of 64 is equal to the half of 10, is a false proposition, and can never be distinctly conceived. But that Cæsar, or the angel Gabriel, or any being never existed, may be a false proposition, but still is perfectly conceivable, and implies no contradiction.
      <br>&emsp;The existence, therefore, of any being can only be proved by arguments from its cause or its effect; and these arguments are founded entirely on experience. If we reason à priori, any thing may appear able to produce any thing. The falling of a pebble may, for ought we know, extinguish the sun; or the wish of a man controul the planets in their orbits. It is only experience, which teaches us the nature and bounds of cause and effect, and enables us to infer the existence of one object from that of another. Such is the foundation of moral reasoning, which forms the greater part of human knowledge, and is the source of all human action and behaviour.
      <br>&emsp;Moral reasonings are either concerning particular or general facts. All deliberations in life regard the former; as also all disquisitions in history, chronology, geography, and astronomy.
      <br>&emsp;The sciences, which treat of general facts, are politics, natural philosophy, physic, chymistry, &c. where the qualities, causes and effects of a whole species of objects are enquired into.
      <br>&emsp;Divinity or Theology, as it proves the existence of a Deity, and the immortality of souls, is composed partly of reasonings concerning particular, partly concerning general facts. It has a foundation in reason, so far as it is supported by experience. But its best and most solid foundation is faith and divine revelation.
      <br>&emsp;When we run over libraries, persuaded of these principles, what havoc must we make? If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: For it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

      Every one will readily allow, that there is a considerable difference between the perceptions of the mind, when a man feels the pain of excessive heat, or the pleasure of moderate warmth, and when he afterwards recalls to his memory this sensation, or anticipates it by his imagination. These faculties may mimic or copy the perceptions of the senses; but they never can entirely reach the force and vivacity of the original sentiment. The utmost we say of them, even when they operate with greatest vigour, is, that they represent their object in so lively a manner, that we could almost say we feel or see it: But, except the mind be disordered by disease or madness, they never can arrive at such a pitch of vivacity, as to render these perceptions altogether undistinguishable. All the colours of poetry, however splendid, can never paint natural objects in such a manner as to make the description be taken for a real landskip. The most lively thought is still inferior to the dullest sensation.
      <br>&emsp;We may observe a like distinction to run through all the other perceptions of the mind. A man in a fit of anger, is actuated in a very different manner from one who only thinks of that emotion. If you tell me, that any person is in love, I easily understand your meaning, and form a just conception of his situation; but never can mistake that conception for the real disorders and agitations of the passion. When we reflect on our past sentiments and affections, our thought is a faithful mirror, and copies its objects truly; but the colours which it employs are faint and dull, in comparison of those in which our original perceptions were clothed. It requires no nice discernment or metaphysical head to mark the distinction between them.
      <br>&emsp;Here therefore we may divide all the perceptions of the mind into two classes or species, which are distinguished by their different degrees of force and vivacity. The less forcible and lively are commonly denominated Thoughts or Ideas. The other species want a name in our language, and in most others; I suppose, because it was not requisite for any, but philosophical purposes, to rank them under a general term or appellation. Let us, therefore, use a little freedom, and call them Impressions; employing that word in a sense somewhat different from the usual. By the term impression, then, I mean all our more lively perceptions, when we hear, or see, or feel, or love, or hate, or desire, or will. And impressions are distinguished from ideas, which are the less lively perceptions, of which we are conscious, when we reflect on any of those sensations or movements above mentioned.
      <br>&emsp;Nothing, at first view, may seem more unbounded than the thought of man, which not only escapes all human power and authority, but is not even restrained within the limits of nature and reality. To form monsters, and join incongruous shapes and appearances, costs the imagination no more trouble than to conceive the most natural and familiar objects. And while the body is confined to one planet, along which it creeps with pain and difficulty; the thought can in an instant transport us into the most distant regions of the universe; or even beyond the universe, into the unbounded chaos, where nature is supposed to lie in total confusion. What never was seen, or heard of, may yet be conceived; nor is any thing beyond the power of thought, except what implies an absolute contradiction.
      <br>&emsp;But though our thought seems to possess this unbounded liberty, we shall find, upon a nearer examination, that it is really confined within very narrow limits, and that all this creative power of the mind amounts to no more than the faculty of compounding, transposing, augmenting, or diminishing the materials afforded us by the senses and experience. When we think of a golden mountain, we only join two consistent ideas, gold, and mountain, with which we were formerly acquainted. A virtuous horse we can conceive; because, from our own feeling, we can conceive virtue; and this we may unite to the figure and shape of a horse, which is an animal familiar to us. In short, all the materials of thinking are derived either from our outward or inward sentiment: The mixture and composition of these belongs alone to the mind and will. Or, to express myself in philosophical language, all our ideas or more feeble perceptions are copies of our impressions or more lively ones.
      <br>&emsp;To prove this, the two following arguments will, I hope, be sufficient. First, when we analyse our thoughts or ideas, however compounded or sublime, we always find, that they resolve themselves into such simple ideas as were copied from a precedent feeling or sentiment. Even those ideas, which, at first view, seem the most wide of this origin, are found, upon a nearer scrutiny, to be derived from it. The idea of God, as meaning an infinitely intelligent, wise, and good Being, arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and augmenting, without limit, those qualities of goodness and wisdom. We may prosecute this enquiry to what length we please; where we shall always find, that every idea which we examine is copied from a similar impression. Those who would assert, that this position is not universally true nor without exception, have only one, and that an easy method of refuting it; by producing that idea, which, in their opinion, is not derived from this source. It will then be incumbent on us, if we would maintain our doctrine, to produce the impression or lively perception, which corresponds to it.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly. If it happen, from a defect of the organ, that a man is not susceptible of any species of sensation, we always find, that he is as little susceptible of the correspondent ideas. A blind man can form no notion of colours; a deaf man of sounds. Restore either of them that sense, in which he is deficient; by opening this new inlet for his sensations, you also open an inlet for the ideas; and he finds no difficulty in conceiving these objects. The case is the same, if the object, proper for exciting any sensation, has never been applied to the organ. A Laplander or Negroe has no notion of the relish of wine. And though there are few or no instances of a like deficiency in the mind, where a person has never felt or is wholly incapable of a sentiment or passion, that belongs to his species; yet we find the same observation to take place in a less degree. A man of mild manners can form no idea of inveterate revenge or cruelty; nor can a selfish heart easily conceive the heights of friendship and generosity. It is readily allowed, that other beings may possess many senses of which we can have no conception; because the ideas of them have never been introduced to us, in the only manner, by which an idea can have access to the mind, to wit, by the actual feeling and sensation.
      <br>&emsp;There is, however, one contradictory phænomenon, which may prove, that it is not absolutely impossible for ideas to arise, independent of their correspondent impressions. I believe it will readily be allowed, that the several distinct ideas of colour, which enter by the eye, or those of sound, which are conveyed by the ear, are really different from each other; though, at the same time, resembling. Now if this be true of different colours, it must be no less so of the different shades of the same colour; and each shade produces a distinct idea, independent of the rest. For if this should be denied, it is possible, by the continual gradation of shades, to run a colour insensibly into what is most remote from it; and if you will not allow any of the means to be different, you cannot, without absurdity, deny the extremes to be the same. Suppose, therefore, a person to have enjoyed his sight for thirty years, and to have become perfectly acquainted with colours of all kinds, except one particular shade of blue, for instance, which it never has been his fortune to meet with. Let all the different shades of that colour, except that single one, be placed before him, descending gradually from the deepest to the lightest; it is plain, that he will perceive a blank, where that shade is wanting, and will be sensible, that there is a greater distance in that place between the contiguous colours than in any other. Now I ask, whether it be possible for him, from his own imagination, to supply this deficiency, and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade, though it had never been conveyed to him by his senses? I believe there are few but will be of opinion that he can: And this may serve as a proof, that the simple ideas are not always, in every instance, derived from the correspondent impressions; though this instance is so singular, that it is scarcely worth our observing, and does not merit, that for it alone we should alter our general maxim.
      <br>&emsp;Here, therefore, is a proposition, which not only seems, in itself, simple and intelligible; but, if a proper use were made of it, might render every dispute equally intelligible, and banish all that jargon, which has so long taken possession of metaphysical reasonings, and drawn disgrace upon them. All ideas, especially abstract ones, are naturally faint and obscure: The mind has but a slender hold of them: They are apt to be confounded with other resembling ideas; and when we have often employed any term, though without a distinct meaning, we are apt to imagine it has a determinate idea, annexed to it. On the contrary, all impressions, that is, all sensations, either outward or inward, are strong and vivid: The limits between them are more exactly determined: Nor is it easy to fall into any error or mistake with regard to them. When we entertain, therefore, any suspicion, that a philosophical term is employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we need but enquire, from what impression is that supposed idea derived? And if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our suspicion. By bringing ideas into so clear a light, we may reasonably hope to remove all dispute, which may arise, concerning their nature and reality.
      <br>&emsp;It is probable that no more was meant by those, who denied innate ideas, than that all ideas were copies of our impressions; though it must be confessed, that the terms, which they employed, were not chosen with such caution, nor so exactly defined, as to prevent all mistakes about their doctrine. For what is meant by innate? If innate be equivalent to natural, then all the perceptions and ideas of the mind must be allowed to be innate or natural, in whatever sense we take the latter word, whether in opposition to what is uncommon, artificial, or miraculous. If by innate be meant, contemporary to our birth, the dispute seems to be frivolous; nor is it worth while to enquire at what time thinking begins, whether before, at, or after our birth. Again, the word idea, seems to be commonly taken in a very loose sense, by Locke and others; as standing for any of our perceptions, our sensations and passions, as well as thoughts. Now in this sense, I should desire to know, what can be meant by asserting, that self-love, or resentment of injuries, or the passion between the sexes is not innate?
      <br>&emsp;But admitting these terms, impressions and ideas, in the sense above explained, and understanding by innate, what is original or copied from no precedent perception, then may we assert, that all our impressions are innate, and our ideas not innate.
      <br>&emsp;To be ingenuous, I must own it to be my opinion, that Locke was betrayed into this question by the schoolmen, who, making use of undefined terms, draw out their disputes to a tedious length, without ever touching the point in question. A like ambiguity and circumlocution seem to run through that philosopher's reasonings on this as well as most other subjects.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="AssociationIdeas">
      It is evident, that there is a principle of connexion between the different thoughts or ideas of the mind, and that, in their appearance to the memory or imagination, they introduce each other with a certain degree of method and regularity. In our more serious thinking or discourse, this is so observable, that any particular thought, which breaks in upon the regular tract or chain of ideas, is immediately remarked and rejected. And even in our wildest and most wandering reveries, nay in our very dreams, we shall find, if we reflect, that the imagination ran not altogether at adventures, but that there was still a connexion upheld among the different ideas, which succeeded each other. Were the loosest and freest conversation to be transcribed, there would immediately be observed something, which connected it in all its transitions. Or where this is wanting, the person, who broke the thread of discourse, might still inform you, that there had secretly revolved in his mind a succession of thought, which had gradually led him from the subject of conversation. Among different languages, even where we cannot suspect the least connexion or communication, it is found, that the words, expressive of ideas, the most compounded, do yet nearly correspond to each other: A certain proof, that the simple ideas, comprehended in the compound ones, were bound together by some universal principle, which had an equal influence on all mankind.
      <br>&emsp;Though it be too obvious to escape observation, that different ideas are connected together; I do not find, that any philosopher has attempted to enumerate or class all the principles of association; a subject, however, that seems worthy of curiosity. To me, there appear to be only three principles of connexion among ideas, namely, Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause or Effect.
      <br>&emsp;That these principles serve to connect ideas will not, I believe, be much doubted. A picture naturally leads our thoughts to the original: The mention of one apartment in a building naturally introduces an enquiry or discourse concerning the others: And if we think of a wound, we can scarcely forbear reflecting on the pain which follows it. But that this enumeration is compleat, and that there are no other principles of association, except these, may be difficult to prove to the satisfaction of the reader, or even to a man's own satisfaction. All we can do, in such cases, is to run over several instances, and examine carefully the principle, which binds the different thoughts to each other, never stopping till we render the principle as general as possible. The more instances we examine, and the more care we employ, the more assurance shall we acquire, that the enumeration, which we form from the whole, is compleat and entire.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="ScepticalUnderstanding">
      All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact. Of the first kind are the sciences of Geometry, Algebra, and Arithmetic; and in short, every affirmation, which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain. That the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the square of the two sides, is a proposition, which expresses a relation between these figures. That three times five is equal to the half of thirty, expresses a relation between these numbers. Propositions of this kind are discoverable by the mere operation of thought, without dependence on what is any where existent in the universe. Though there never were a circle or triangle in nature, the truths, demonstrated by Euclid, would for ever retain their certainty and evidence.
      <br>&emsp;Matters of fact, which are the second objects of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing. The contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a contradiction, and is conceived by the mind with the same facility and distinctness, as if ever so conformable to reality. That the sun will not rise to-morrow is no less intelligible a proposition, and implies no more contradiction, than the affirmation, that it will rise. We should in vain, therefore, attempt to demonstrate its falsehood. Were it demonstratively false, it would imply a contradiction, and could never be distinctly conceived by the mind.
      <br>&emsp;It may, therefore, be a subject worthy of curiosity, to enquire what is the nature of that evidence, which assures us of any real existence and matter of fact, beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the records of our memory. This part of philosophy, it is observable, has been little cultivated, either by the ancients or moderns; and therefore our doubts and errors, in the prosecution of so important an enquiry, may be the more excusable; while we march through such difficult paths, without any guide or direction. They may even prove useful, by exciting curiosity, and destroying that implicit faith and security, which is the bane of all reasoning and free enquiry. The discovery of defects in the common philosophy, if any such there be, will not, I presume, be a discouragement, but rather an incitement, as is usual, to attempt something more full and satisfactory, than has yet been proposed to the public.
      <br>&emsp;All reasonings concerning matter of fact seem to be founded on the relation of Cause and Effect. By means of that relation alone we can go beyond the evidence of our memory and senses. If you were to ask a man, why he believes any matter of fact, which is absent; for instance, that his friend is in the country, or in France; he would give you a reason; and this reason would be some other fact; as a letter received from him, or the knowledge of his former resolutions and promises. A man, finding a watch or any other machine in a desart island, would conclude, that there had once been men in that island. All our reasonings concerning fact are of the same nature. And here it is constantly supposed, that there is a connexion between the present fact and that which is inferred from it. Were there nothing to bind them together, the inference would be entirely precarious. The hearing of an articulate voice and rational discourse in the dark assures us of the presence of some person: Why? because these are the effects of the human make and fabric, and closely connected with it. If we anatomize all the other reasonings of this nature, we shall find, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect, and that this relation is either near or remote, direct or collateral. Heat and light are collateral effects of fire, and the one effect may justly be inferred from the other.
      <br>&emsp;If we would satisfy ourselves, therefore, concerning the nature of that evidence, which assures us of matters of fact, we must enquire how we arrive at the knowledge of cause and effect.
      <br>&emsp;I shall venture to affirm, as a general proposition, which admits of no exception, that the knowledge of this relation is not, in any instance, attained by reasonings à priori; but arises entirely from experience, when we find, that any particular objects are constantly conjoined with each other. Let an object be presented to a man of ever so strong natural reason and abilities; if that object be entirely new to him, he will not be able, by the most accurate examination of its sensible qualities, to discover any of its causes or effects. Adam, though his rational faculties be supposed, at the very first, entirely perfect, could not have inferred from the fluidity, and transparency of water, that it would suffocate him, or from the light and warmth of fire, that it would consume him. No object ever discovers, by the qualities which appear to the senses, either the causes which produced it, or the effects which will arise from it; nor can our reason, unassisted by experience, ever draw any inference concerning real existence and matter of fact.
      <br>&emsp;This proposition, that causes and effects are discoverable, not by reason, but by experience, will readily be admitted with regard to such objects, as we remember to have once been altogether unknown to us; since we must be conscious of the utter inability, which we then lay under, of foretelling, what would arise from them. Present two smooth pieces of marble to a man, who has no tincture of natural philosophy; he will never discover, that they will adhere together, in such a manner as to require great force to separate them in a direct line, while they make so small a resistance to a lateral pressure. Such events, as bear little analogy to the common course of nature, are also readily confessed to be known only by experience; nor does any man imagine that the explosion of gunpowder, or the attraction of a loadstone, could ever be discovered by arguments à priori. In like manner, when an effect is supposed to depend upon an intricate machinery or secret structure of parts, we make no difficulty in attributing all our knowledge of it to experience. Who will assert, that he can give the ultimate reason, why milk or bread is proper nourishment for a man, not for a lion or a tyger?
      <br>&emsp;But the same truth may not appear, at first sight, to have the same evidence with regard to events, which have become familiar to us from our first appearance in the world, which bear a close analogy to the whole course of nature, and which are supposed to depend on the simple qualities of objects, without any secret structure of parts. We are apt to imagine, that we could discover these effects by the mere operation of our reason, without experience. We fancy, that were we brought, on a sudden, into this world, we could at first have inferred, that one Billiard-ball would communicate motion to another upon impulse; and that we needed not to have waited for the event, in order to pronounce with certainty concerning it. Such is the influence of custom, that, where it is strongest, it not only covers our natural ignorance, but even conceals itself, and seems not to take place, merely because it is found in the highest degree.
      <br>&emsp;But to convince us, that all the laws of nature, and all the operations of bodies without exception, are known only by experience, the following reflections may, perhaps, suffice. Were any object presented to us, and were we required to pronounce concerning the effect, which will result from it, without consulting past observation; after what manner, I beseech you, must the mind proceed in this operation? It must invent or imagine some event, which it ascribes to the object as its effect; and it is plain that this invention must be entirely arbitrary. The mind can never possibly find the effect in the supposed cause, by the most accurate scrutiny and examination. For the effect is totally different from the cause, and consequently can never be discovered in it. Motion in the second Billiard-ball is a quite distinct event from motion in the first; nor is there any thing in the one to suggest the smallest hint of the other. A stone or piece of metal raised into the air, and left without any support, immediately falls: But to consider the matter à priori, is there any thing we discover in this situation, which can beget the idea of a downward, rather than an upward, or any other motion, in the stone or metal?
      <br>&emsp;And as the first imagination or invention of a particular effect, in all natural operations, is arbitrary, where we consult not experience; so must we also esteem the supposed tye or connexion between the cause and effect, which binds them together, and renders it impossible, that any other effect could result from the operation of that cause. When I see, for instance, a Billiard-ball moving in a straight line towards another; even suppose motion in the second ball should by accident be suggested to me, as the result of their contact or impulse; may I not conceive, that a hundred different events might as well follow from that cause? May not both these balls remain at absolute rest? May not the first ball return in a straight line, or leap off from the second in any line or direction? All these suppositions are consistent and conceivable. Why then should we give the preference to one, which is no more consistent or conceivable than the rest? All our reasonings à priori will never be able to shew us any foundation for this preference.
      <br>&emsp;In a word, then, every effect is a distinct event from its cause. It could not, therefore, be discovered in the cause, and the first invention or conception of it, à priori, must be entirely arbitrary. And even after it is suggested, the conjunction of it with the cause must appear equally arbitrary; since there are always many other effects, which, to reason, must seem fully as consistent and natural. In vain, therefore, should we pretend to determine any single event, or infer any cause or effect, without the assistance of observation and experience.
      <br>&emsp;Hence we may discover the reason, why no philosopher, who is rational and modest, has ever pretended to assign the ultimate cause of any natural operation, or to show distinctly the action of that power, which produces any single effect in the universe. It is confessed, that the utmost effort of human reason is, to reduce the principles, productive of natural phænomena, to a greater simplicity, and to resolve the many particular effects into a few general causes, by means of reasonings from analogy, experience, and observation. But as to the causes of these general causes, we should in vain attempt their discovery; nor shall we ever be able to satisfy ourselves, by any particular explication of them. These ultimate springs and principles are totally shut up from human curiosity and enquiry. Elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts, communication of motion by impulse; these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which we shall ever discover in nature; and we may esteem ourselves sufficiently happy, if, by accurate enquiry and reasoning, we can trace up the particular phænomena to, or near to, these general principles. The most perfect philosophy of the natural kind only staves off our ignorance a little longer: As perhaps the most perfect philosophy of the moral or metaphysical kind serves only to discover larger portions of it. Thus the observation of human blindness and weakness is the result of all philosophy, and meets us, at every turn, in spite of our endeavours to elude or avoid it.
      <br>&emsp;Nor is geometry, when taken into the assistance of natural philosophy, ever able to remedy this defect, or lead us into the knowledge of ultimate causes, by all that accuracy of reasoning, for which it is so justly celebrated. Every part of mixed mathematics proceeds upon the supposition, that certain laws are established by nature in her operations; and abstract reasonings are employed, either to assist experience in the discovery of these laws, or to determine their influence in particular instances, where it depends upon any precise degree of distance and quantity. Thus, it is a law of motion, discovered by experience, that the moment or force of any body in motion is in the compound ratio or proportion of its solid contents and its velocity; and consequently, that a small force may remove the greatest obstacle or raise the greatest weight, if, by any contrivance or machinery, we can encrease the velocity of that force, so as to make it an overmatch for its antagonist. Geometry assists us in the application of this law, by giving us the just dimensions of all the parts and figures, which can enter into any species of machine; but still the discovery of the law itself is owing merely to experience, and all the abstract reasonings in the world could never lead us one step towards the knowledge of it. When we reason à priori, and consider merely any object or cause, as it appears to the mind, independent of all observation, it never could suggest to us the notion of any distinct object, such as its effect; much less, shew us the inseparable and inviolable connexion between them. A man must be very sagacious, who could discover by reasoning, that crystal is the effect of heat, and ice of cold, without being previously acquainted with the operation of these qualities.
      <br>&emsp;Part Ii.
      <br>&emsp;But we have not, yet, attained any tolerable satisfaction with regard to the question first proposed. Each solution still gives rise to a new question as difficult as the foregoing, and leads us on to farther enquiries. When it is asked, What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, Experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humour, and ask, What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication. Philosophers, that give themselves airs of superior wisdom and sufficiency, have a hard task, when they encounter persons of inquisitive dispositions, who push them from every corner, to which they retreat, and who are sure at last to bring them to some dangerous dilemma. The best expedient to prevent this confusion, is to be modest in our pretensions; and even to discover the difficulty ourselves before it is objected to us. By this means, we may make a kind of merit of our very ignorance.
      <br>&emsp;I shall content myself, in this section, with an easy task, and shall pretend only to give a negative answer to the question here proposed. I say then, that, even after we have experience of the operations of cause and effect, our conclusions from that experience are not founded on reasoning, or any process of the understanding. This answer we must endeavour, both to explain and to defend.
      <br>&emsp;It must certainly be allowed, that nature has kept us at a great distance from all her secrets, and has afforded us only the knowledge of a few superficial qualities of objects; while she conceals from us those powers and principles, on which the influence of these objects entirely depends. Our senses inform us of the colour, weight, and consistence of bread; but neither sense nor reason can ever inform us of those qualities, which fit it for the nourishment and support of a human body. Sight or feeling conveys an idea of the actual motion of bodies; but as to that wonderful force or power, which would carry on a moving body for ever in a continued change of place, and which bodies never lose but by communicating it to others; of this we cannot form the most distant conception. But notwithstanding this ignorance of natural powers and principles, we always presume, when we see like sensible qualities, that they have like secret powers, and expect, that effects, similar to those which we have experienced, will follow from them. If a body of like colour and consistence with that bread, which we have formerly eat, be presented to us, we make no scruple of repeating the experiment, and foresee, with certainty, like nourishment and support. Now this is a process of the mind or thought, of which I would willingly know the foundation. It is allowed on all hands, that there is no known connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers; and consequently, that the mind is not led to form such a conclusion concerning their constant and regular conjunction, by any thing which it knows of their nature. As to past Experience, it can be allowed to give direct and certain information of those precise objects only, and that precise period of time, which fell under its cognizance: But why this experience should be extended to future times, and to other objects, which for aught we know, may be only in appearance similar; this is the main question on which I would insist. The bread, which I formerly eat, nourished me; that is, a body of such sensible qualities, was, at that time, endued with such secret powers: But does it follow, that other bread must also nourish me at another time, and that like sensible qualities must always be attended with like secret powers? The consequence seems nowise necessary. At least, it must be acknowledged, that there is here a consequence drawn by the mind; that there is a certain step taken; a process of thought, and an inference, which wants to be explained. These two propositions are far from being the same, I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect, and I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance, similar, will be attended with similar effects. I shall allow, if you please, that the one proposition may justly be inferred from the other: I know in fact, that it always is inferred. But if you insist, that the inference is made by a chain of reasoning, I desire you to produce that reasoning. The connexion between these propositions is not intuitive. There is required a medium, which may enable the mind to draw such an inference, if indeed it be drawn by reasoning and argument. What that medium is, I must confess, passes my comprehension; and it is incumbent on those to produce it, who assert, that it really exists, and is the origin of all our conclusions concerning matter of fact.
      <br>&emsp;This negative argument must certainly, in process of time, become altogether convincing, if many penetrating and able philosophers shall turn their enquiries this way; and no one be ever able to discover any connecting proposition or intermediate step, which supports the understanding in this conclusion. But as the question is yet new, every reader may not trust so far to his own penetration, as to conclude, because an argument escapes his enquiry, that therefore it does not really exist. For this reason it may be requisite to venture upon a more difficult task; and enumerating all the branches of human knowledge, endeavour to shew, that none of them can afford such an argument.
      <br>&emsp;All reasonings may be divided into two kinds, namely demonstrative reasoning, or that concerning relations of ideas, and moral reasoning, or that concerning matter of fact and existence. That there are no demonstrative arguments in the case, seems evident; since it implies no contradiction, that the course of nature may change, and that an object, seemingly like those which we have experienced, may be attended with different or contrary effects. May I not clearly and distinctly conceive, that a body, falling from the clouds, and which, in all other respects, resembles snow, has yet the taste of salt or feeling of fire? Is there any more intelligible proposition than to affirm, that all the trees will flourish in December and January, and decay in May and June? Now whatever is intelligible, and can be distinctly conceived, implies no contradiction, and can never be proved false by any demonstrative argument or abstract reasoning à priori.
      <br>&emsp;If we be, therefore, engaged by arguments to put trust in past experience, and make it the standard of our future judgment, these arguments must be probable only, or such as regard matter of fact and real existence, according to the division above mentioned. But that there is no argument of this kind, must appear, if our explication of that species of reasoning be admitted as solid and satisfactory. We have said, that all arguments concerning existence are founded on the relation of cause and effect; that our knowledge of that relation is derived entirely from experience; and that all our experimental conclusions proceed upon the supposition, that the future will be conformable to the past. To endeavour, therefore, the proof of this last supposition by probable arguments, or arguments regarding existence, must be evidently going in a circle, and taking that for granted, which is the very point in question.
      <br>&emsp;In reality, all arguments from experience are founded on the similarity, which we discover among natural objects, and by which we are induced to expect effects similar to those, which we have found to follow from such objects. And though none but a fool or madman will ever pretend to dispute the authority of experience, or to reject that great guide of human life; it may surely be allowed a philosopher to have so much curiosity at least, as to examine the principle of human nature, which gives this mighty authority to experience, and makes us draw advantage from that similarity, which nature has placed among different objects. From causes, which appear similar, we expect similar effects. This is the sum of all our experimental conclusions. Now it seems evident, that, if this conclusion were formed by reason, it would be as perfect at first, and upon one instance, as after ever so long a course of experience. But the case is far otherwise. Nothing so like as eggs; yet no one, on account of this appearing similarity, expects the same taste and relish in all of them. It is only after a long course of uniform experiments in any kind, that we attain a firm reliance and security with regard to a particular event. Now where is that process of reasoning, which, from one instance, draws a conclusion, so different from that which it infers from a hundred instances, that are nowise different from that single one? This question I propose as much for the sake of information, as with an intention of raising difficulties. I cannot find, I cannot imagine any such reasoning. But I keep my mind still open to instruction, if any one will vouchsafe to bestow it on me.
      <br>&emsp;Should it be said, that, from a number of uniform experiments, we infer a connexion between the sensible qualities and the secret powers; this, I must confess, seems the same difficulty, couched in different terms. The question still recurs, on what process of argument this inference is founded? Where is the medium, the interposing ideas, which join propositions so very wide of each other? It is confessed, that the colour, consistence, and other sensible qualities of bread appear not, of themselves, to have any connexion with the secret powers of nourishment and support. For otherwise we could infer these secret powers from the first appearance of these sensible qualities, without the aid of experience; contrary to the sentiment of all philosophers, and contrary to plain matter of fact. Here then is our natural state of ignorance with regard to the powers and influence of all objects. How is this remedied by experience? It only shews us a number of uniform effects, resulting from certain objects, and teaches us, that those particular objects, at that particular time, were endowed with such powers and forces. When a new object, endowed with similar sensible qualities, is produced, we expect similar powers and forces, and look for a like effect. From a body of like colour and consistence with bread, we expect like nourishment and support. But this surely is a step or progress of the mind, which wants to be explained. When a man says, I have found, in all past instances, such sensible qualities conjoined with such secret powers: And when he says, similar sensible qualities will always be conjoined with similar secret powers; he is not guilty of a tautology, nor are these propositions in any respect the same. You say that the one proposition is an inference from the other. But you must confess that the inference is not intuitive; neither is it demonstrative: Of what nature is it then? To say it is experimental, is begging the question. For all inferences from experience suppose, as their foundation, that the future will resemble the past, and that similar powers will be conjoined with similar sensible qualities. If there be any suspicion, that the course of nature may change, and that the past may be no rule for the future, all experience becomes useless, and can give rise to no inference or conclusion. It is impossible, therefore, that any arguments from experience can prove this resemblance of the past to the future; since all these arguments are founded on the supposition of that resemblance. Let the course of things be allowed hitherto ever so regular; that alone, without some new argument or inference, proves not, that, for the future, it will continue so. In vain do you pretend to have learned the nature of bodies from your past experience. Their secret nature, and consequently, all their effects and influence, may change, without any change in their sensible qualities. This happens sometimes, and with regard to some objects: Why may it not happen always, and with regard to all objects? What logic, what process of argument secures you against this supposition? My practice, you say, refutes my doubts. But you mistake the purport of my question. As an agent, I am quite satisfied in the point; but as a philosopher, who has some share of curiosity, I will not say scepticism, I want to learn the foundation of this inference. No reading, no enquiry has yet been able to remove my difficulty, or give me satisfaction in a matter of such importance. Can I do better than propose the difficulty to the public, even though, perhaps, I have small hopes of obtaining a solution? We shall at least, by this means, be sensible of our ignorance, if we do not augment our knowledge.
      <br>&emsp;I must confess, that a man is guilty of unpardonable arrogance, who concludes, because an argument has escaped his own investigation, that therefore it does not really exist. I must also confess, that, though all the learned, for several ages, should have employed themselves in fruitless search upon any subject, it may still, perhaps, be rash to conclude positively, that the subject must, therefore, pass all human comprehension. Even though we examine all the sources of our knowledge, and conclude them unfit for such a subject, there may still remain a suspicion, that the enumeration is not compleat, or the examination not accurate. But with regard to the present subject, there are some considerations, which seem to remove all this accusation of arrogance or suspicion of mistake.
      <br>&emsp;It is certain, that the most ignorant and stupid peasants, nay infants, nay even brute beasts, improve by experience, and learn the qualities of natural objects, by observing the effects, which result from them. When a child has felt the sensation of pain from touching the flame of a candle, he will be careful not to put his hand near any candle; but will expect a similar effect from a cause, which is similar in its sensible qualities and appearance. If you assert, therefore, that the understanding of the child is led into this conclusion by any process of argument or ratiocination, I may justly require you to produce that argument; nor have you any pretence to refuse so equitable a demand. You cannot say, that the argument is abstruse, and may possibly escape your enquiry; since you confess, that it is obvious to the capacity of a mere infant. If you hesitate, therefore, a moment, or if, after reflection, you produce any intricate or profound argument, you, in a manner, give up the question, and confess, that it is not reasoning which engages us to suppose the past resembling the future, and to expect similar effects from causes, which are, to appearance, similar. This is the proposition which I intended to enforce in the present section. If I be right, I pretend not to have made any mighty discovery. And if I be wrong, I must acknowledge myself to be indeed a very backward scholar; since I cannot now discover an argument, which, it seems, was perfectly familiar to me, long before I was out of my cradle.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="SolutionDoubts">
      The passion for philosophy, like that for religion, seems liable to this inconvenience, that, though it aims at the correction of our manners, and extirpation of our vices, it may only serve, by imprudent management, to foster a predominant inclination, and push the mind, with more determined resolution, towards that side, which already draws too much, by the biass and propensity of the natural temper. It is certain, that, while we aspire to the magnanimous firmness of the philosophic sage, and endeavour to confine our pleasures altogether within our own minds, we may, at last, render our philosophy like that of Epictetus, and other Stoics, only a more refined system of selfishness, and reason ourselves out of all virtue, as well as social enjoyment. While we study with attention the vanity of human life, and turn all our thoughts towards the empty and transitory nature of riches and honours, we are, perhaps, all the while, flattering our natural indolence, which, hating the bustle of the world, and drudgery of business, seeks a pretence of reason, to give itself a full and uncontrouled indulgence. There is, however, one species of philosophy, which seems little liable to this inconvenience, and that because it strikes in with no disorderly passion of the human mind, nor can mingle itself with any natural affection or propensity; and that is the Academic or Sceptical philosophy. The academics always talk of doubt and suspense of judgment, of danger in hasty determinations, of confining to very narrow bounds the enquiries of the understanding, and of renouncing all speculations which lie not within the limits of common life and practice. Nothing, therefore, can be more contrary than such a philosophy to the supine indolence of the mind, its rash arrogance, its lofty pretensions, and its superstitious credulity. Every passion is mortified by it, except the love of truth; and that passion never is, nor can be carried to too high a degree. It is surprising, therefore, that this philosophy, which, in almost every instance, must be harmless and innocent, should be the subject of so much groundless reproach and obloquy. But, perhaps, the very circumstance, which renders it so innocent, is what chiefly exposes it to the public hatred and resentment. By flattering no irregular passion, it gains few partizans: By opposing so many vices and follies, it raises to itself abundance of enemies, who stigmatize it as libertine, profane, and irreligious.
      <br>&emsp;Nor need we fear, that this philosophy, while it endeavours to limit our enquiries to common life, should ever undermine the reasonings of common life, and carry its doubts so far as to destroy all action, as well as speculation. Nature will always maintain her rights, and prevail in the end over any abstract reasoning whatsoever. Though we should conclude, for instance, as in the foregoing section, that, in all reasonings from experience, there is a step taken by the mind, which is not supported by any argument or process of the understanding; there is no danger, that these reasonings, on which almost all knowledge depends, will ever be affected by such a discovery. If the mind be not engaged by argument to make this step, it must be induced by some other principle of equal weight and authority; and that principle will preserve its influence as long as human nature remains the same. What that principle is, may well be worth the pains of enquiry.
      <br>&emsp;Suppose a person, though endowed with the strongest faculties of reason and reflection, to be brought on a sudden into this world; he would, indeed, immediately observe a continual succession of objects, and one event following another; but he would not be able to discover any thing farther. He would not, at first, by any reasoning, be able to reach the idea of cause and effect; since the particular powers, by which all natural operations are performed, never appear to the senses; nor is it reasonable to conclude, merely because one event, in one instance, precedes another, that therefore the one is the cause, the other the effect. Their conjunction may be arbitrary and casual. There may be no reason to infer the existence of one from the appearance of the other. And in a word, such a person, without more experience, could never employ his conjecture or reasoning concerning any matter of fact, or be assured of any thing beyond what was immediately present to his memory and senses.
      <br>&emsp;Suppose again, that he has acquired more experience, and has lived so long in the world as to have observed similar objects or events to be constantly conjoined together; what is the consequence of this experience? He immediately infers the existence of one object from the appearance of the other. Yet he has not, by all his experience, acquired any idea or knowledge of the secret power, by which the one object produces the other; nor is it, by any process of reasoning, he is engaged to draw this inference. But still he finds himself determined to draw it: And though he should be convinced, that his understanding has no part in the operation, he would nevertheless continue in the same course of thinking. There is some other principle, which determines him to form such a conclusion.
      <br>&emsp;This principle is Custom or Habit. For wherever the repetition of any particular act or operation produces a propensity to renew the same act or operation, without being impelled by any reasoning or process of the understanding; we always say, that this propensity is the effect of Custom. By employing that word, we pretend not to have given the ultimate reason of such a propensity. We only point out a principle of human nature, which is universally acknowledged, and which is well known by its effects. Perhaps, we can push our enquiries no farther, or pretend to give the cause of this cause; but must rest contented with it as the ultimate principle, which we can assign, of all our conclusions from experience. It is sufficient satisfaction, that we can go so far; without repining at the narrowness of our faculties, because they will carry us no farther. And it is certain we here advance a very intelligible proposition at least, if not a true one, when we assert, that, after the constant conjunction of two objects, heat and flame, for instance, weight and solidity, we are determined by custom alone to expect the one from the appearance of the other. This hypothesis seems even the only one, which explains the difficulty, why we draw, from a thousand instances, an inference, which we are not able to draw from one instance, that is, in no respect, different from them. Reason is incapable of any such variation. The conclusions, which it draws from considering one circle, are the same which it would form upon surveying all the circles in the universe. But no man, having seen only one body move after being impelled by another, could infer, that every other body will move after a like impulse. All inferences from experience, therefore, are effects of custom, not of reasoning.
      <br>&emsp;Custom, then, is the great guide of human life. It is that principle alone, which renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past. Without the influence of custom, we should be entirely ignorant of every matter of fact, beyond what is immediately present to the memory and senses. We should never know how to adjust means to ends, or to employ our natural powers in the production of any effect. There would be an end at once of all action, as well as of the chief part of speculation.
      <br>&emsp;But here it may be proper to remark, that though our conclusions from experience carry us beyond our memory and senses, and assure us of matters of fact, which happened in the most distant places and most remote ages; yet some fact must always be present to the senses or memory, from which we may first proceed in drawing these conclusions. A man, who should find in a desert country the remains of pompous buildings, would conclude, that the country had, in ancient times, been cultivated by civilized inhabitants; but did nothing of this nature occur to him, he could never form such an inference. We learn the events of former ages from history; but then we must peruse the volumes, in which this instruction is contained, and thence carry up our inferences from one testimony to another, till we arrive at the eye-witnesses and spectators of these distant events. In a word, if we proceed not upon some fact, present to the memory or senses, our reasonings would be merely hypothetical; and however the particular links might be connected with each other, the whole chain of inferences would have nothing to support it, nor could we ever, by its means, arrive at the knowledge of any real existence. If I ask, why you believe any particular matter of fact, which you relate, you must tell me some reason; and this reason will be some other fact, connected with it. But as you cannot proceed after this manner, in infinitum, you must at last terminate in some fact, which is present to your memory or senses; or must allow that your belief is entirely without foundation.
      <br>&emsp;What then is the conclusion of the whole matter? A simple one; though, it must be confessed, pretty remote from the common theories of philosophy. All belief of matter of fact or real existence is derived merely from some object, present to the memory or senses, and a customary conjunction between that and some other object. Or in other words; having found, in many instances, that any two kinds of objects, flame and heat, snow and cold, have always been conjoined together; if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind is carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and to believe, that such a quality does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer approach. This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in such circumstances. It is an operation of the soul, when we are so situated, as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love, when we receive benefits; or hatred, when we meet with injuries. All these operations are a species of natural instincts, which no reasoning or process of the thought and understanding is able, either to produce, or to prevent.
      <br>&emsp;At this point, it would be very allowable for us to stop our philosophical researches. In most questions, we can never make a single step farther; and in all questions, we must terminate here at last, after our most restless and curious enquiries. But still our curiosity will be pardonable, perhaps commendable, if it carry us on to still farther researches, and make us examine more accurately the nature of this belief, and of the customary conjunction, whence it is derived. By this means we may meet with some explications and analogies, that will give satisfaction; at least to such as love the abstract sciences, and can be entertained with speculations, which, however accurate, may still retain a degree of doubt and uncertainty. As to readers of a different taste; the remaining part of this section is not calculated for them, and the following enquiries may well be understood, though it be neglected.
      <br>&emsp;Part Ii.
      <br>&emsp;Nothing is more free than the imagination of man; and though it cannot exceed that original stock of ideas, furnished by the internal and external senses, it has unlimited power of mixing, compounding, separating, and dividing these ideas, in all the varieties of fiction and vision. It can feign a train of events, with all the appearance of reality, ascribe to them a particular time and place, conceive them as existent, and paint them out to itself with every circumstance, that belongs to any historical fact, which it believes with the greatest certainty. Wherein, therefore, consists the difference between such a fiction and belief? It lies not merely in any peculiar idea, which is annexed to such a conception as commands our assent, and which is wanting to every known fiction. For as the mind has authority over all its ideas, it could voluntarily annex this particular idea to any fiction, and consequently be able to believe whatever it pleases; contrary to what we find by daily experience. We can, in our conception, join the head of a man to the body of a horse; but it is not in our power to believe, that such an animal has ever really existed.
      <br>&emsp;It follows, therefore, that the difference between fiction and belief lies in some sentiment or feeling, which is annexed to the latter, not to the former, and which depends not on the will, nor can be commanded at pleasure. It must be excited by nature, like all other sentiments; and must arise from the particular situation, in which the mind is placed at any particular juncture. Whenever any object is presented to the memory or senses, it immediately, by the force of custom, carries the imagination to conceive that object, which is usually conjoined to it; and this conception is attended with a feeling or sentiment, different from the loose reveries of the fancy. In this consists the whole nature of belief. For as there is no matter of fact which we believe so firmly, that we cannot conceive the contrary, there would be no difference between the conception assented to, and that which is rejected, were it not for some sentiment, which distinguishes the one from the other. If I see a billiard-ball moving towards another, on a smooth table, I can easily conceive it to stop upon contact. This conception implies no contradiction; but still it feels very differently from that conception, by which I represent to myself the impulse, and the communication of motion from one ball to another.
      <br>&emsp;Were we to attempt a definition of this sentiment, we should, perhaps, find it a very difficult, if not an impossible task; in the same manner as if we should endeavour to define the feeling of cold or passion of anger, to a creature who never had any experience of these sentiments. Belief is the true and proper name of this feeling; and no one is ever at a loss to know the meaning of that term; because every man is every moment conscious of the sentiment represented by it. It may not, however, be improper to attempt a description of this sentiment; in hopes we may, by that means, arrive at some analogies, which may afford a more perfect explication of it. I say then, that belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain. This variety of terms, which may seem so unphilosophical, is intended only to express that act of the mind, which renders realities, or what is taken for such, more present to us than fictions, causes them to weigh more in the thought, and gives them a superior influence on the passions and imagination. Provided we agree about the thing, it is needless to dispute about the terms. The imagination has the command over all its ideas, and can join and mix and vary them, in all the ways possible. It may conceive fictitious objects with all the circumstances of place and time. It may set them, in a manner, before our eyes, in their true colours, just as they might have existed. But as it is impossible, that this faculty of imagination can ever, of itself, reach belief, it is evident, that belief consists not in the peculiar nature or order of ideas, but in the manner of their conception, and in their feeling to the mind. I confess, that it is impossible perfectly to explain this feeling or manner of conception. We may make use of words, which express something near it. But its true and proper name, as we observed before, is belief; which is a term, that every one sufficiently understands in common life. And in philosophy, we can go no farther than assert, that belief is something felt by the mind, which distinguishes the ideas of the judgment from the fictions of the imagination. It gives them more weight and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; inforces them in the mind; and renders them the governing principle of our actions. I hear at present, for instance, a person's voice, with whom I am acquainted; and the sound comes as from the next room. This impression of my senses immediately conveys my thought to the person, together with all the surrounding objects. I paint them out to myself as existing at present, with the same qualities and relations, of which I formerly knew them possessed. These ideas take faster hold of my mind, than ideas of an enchanted castle. They are very different to the feeling, and have a much greater influence of every kind, either to give pleasure or pain, joy or sorrow.
      <br>&emsp;Let us, then, take in the whole compass of this doctrine, and allow, that the sentiment of belief is nothing but a conception more intense and steady than what attends the mere fictions of the imagination, and that this manner of conception arises from a customary conjunction of the object with something present to the memory or senses: I believe that it will not be difficult, upon these suppositions, to find other operations of the mind analogous to it, and to trace up these phænomena to principles still more general.
      <br>&emsp;We have already observed, that nature has established connexions among particular ideas, and that no sooner one idea occurs to our thoughts than it introduces its correlative, and carries our attention towards it, by a gentle and insensible movement. These principles of connexion or association we have reduced to three, namely, Resemblance, Contiguity, and Causation; which are the only bonds, that unite our thoughts together, and beget that regular train of reflection or discourse, which, in a greater or less degree, takes place among all mankind. Now here arises a question, on which the solution of the present difficulty will depend. Does it happen, in all these relations, that, when one of the objects is presented to the senses or memory, the mind is not only carried to the conception of the correlative, but reaches a steadier and stronger conception of it than what otherwise it would have been able to attain? This seems to be the case with that belief, which arises from the relation of cause and effect. And if the case be the same with the other relations or principles of association, this may be established as a general law, which takes place in all the operations of the mind.
      <br>&emsp;We may, therefore, observe, as the first experiment to our present purpose, that, upon the appearance of the picture of an absent friend, our idea of him is evidently enlivened by the resemblance, and that every passion, which that idea occasions, whether of joy or sorrow, acquires new force and vigour. In producing this effect, there concur both a relation and a present impression. Where the picture bears him no resemblance, at least was not intended for him, it never so much as conveys our thought to him: And where it is absent, as well as the person; though the mind may pass from the thought of the one to that of the other; it feels its idea to be rather weakened than enlivened by that transition. We take a pleasure in viewing the picture of a friend, when it is set before us; but when it is removed, rather chuse to consider him directly, than by reflection in an image, which is equally distant and obscure.
      <br>&emsp;The ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion may be considered as instances of the same nature. The devotees of that superstition usually plead in excuse for the mummeries, with which they are upbraided, that they feel the good effect of those external motions, and postures, and actions, in enlivening their devotion and quickening their fervour, which otherwise would decay, if directed entirely to distant and immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith, say they, in sensible types and images, and render them more present to us by the immediate presence of these types, than it is possible for us to do, merely by an intellectual view and contemplation. Sensible objects have always a greater influence on the fancy than any other; and this influence they readily convey to those ideas, to which they are related, and which they resemble. I shall only infer from these practices, and this reasoning, that the effect of resemblance in enlivening the ideas is very common; and as in every case a resemblance and a present impression must concur, we are abundantly supplied with experiments to prove the reality of the foregoing principle.
      <br>&emsp;We may add force to these experiments by others of a different kind, in considering the effects of contiguity as well as of resemblance. It is certain, that distance diminishes the force of every idea, and that, upon our approach to any object; though it does not discover itself to our senses; it operates upon the mind with an influence, which imitates an immediate impression. The thinking on any object readily transports the mind to what is contiguous; but it is only the actual presence of an object, that transports it with a superior vivacity. When I am a few miles from home, whatever relates to it touches me more nearly than when I am two hundred leagues distant; though even at that distance the reflecting on any thing in the neighbourhood of my friends or family naturally produces an idea of them. But as in this latter case, both the objects of the mind are ideas; notwithstanding there is an easy transition between them; that transition alone is not able to give a superior vivacity to any of the ideas, for want of some immediate impression.
      <br>&emsp;No one can doubt but causation has the same influence as the other two relations of resemblance and contiguity. Superstitious people are fond of the reliques of saints and holy men, for the same reason, that they seek after types or images, in order to enliven their devotion, and give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary lives, which they desire to imitate. Now it is evident, that one of the best reliques, which a devotee could procure, would be the handywork of a saint; and if his cloaths and furniture are ever to be considered in this light, it is because they were once at his disposal, and were moved and affected by him; in which respect they are to be considered as imperfect effects, and as connected with him by a shorter chain of consequences than any of those, by which we learn the reality of his existence.
      <br>&emsp;Suppose, that the son of a friend, who had been long dead or absent, were presented to us; it is evident, that this object would instantly revive its correlative idea, and recal to our thoughts all past intimacies and familiarities, in more lively colours than they would otherwise have appeared to us. This is another phænomenon, which seems to prove the principle above-mentioned.
      <br>&emsp;We may observe, that, in these phænomena, the belief of the correlative object is always presupposed; without which the relation could have no effect. The influence of the picture supposes, that we believe our friend to have once existed. Contiguity to home can never excite our ideas of home, unless we believe that it really exists. Now I assert, that this belief, where it reaches beyond the memory or senses, is of a similar nature, and arises from similar causes, with the transition of thought and vivacity of conception here explained. When I throw a piece of dry wood into a fire, my mind is immediately carried to conceive, that it augments, not extinguishes the flame. This transition of thought from the cause to the effect proceeds not from reason. It derives its origin altogether from custom and experience. And as it first begins from an object, present to the senses, it renders the idea or conception of flame more strong and lively than any loose, floating reverie of the imagination. That idea arises immediately. The thought moves instantly towards it, and conveys to it all that force of conception, which is derived from the impression present to the senses. When a sword is levelled at my breast, does not the idea of wound and pain strike me more strongly, than when a glass of wine is presented to me, even though by accident this idea should occur after the appearance of the latter object? But what is there in this whole matter to cause such a strong conception, except only a present object and a customary transition to the idea of another object, which we have been accustomed to conjoin with the former? This is the whole operation of the mind, in all our conclusions concerning matter of fact and existence; and it is a satisfaction to find some analogies, by which it may be explained. The transition from a present object does in all cases give strength and solidity to the related idea.
      <br>&emsp;Here, then, is a kind of pre-established harmony between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas; and though the powers and forces, by which the former is governed, be wholly unknown to us; yet our thoughts and conceptions have still, we find, gone on in the same train with the other works of nature. Custom is that principle, by which this correspondence has been effected; so necessary to the subsistence of our species, and the regulation of our conduct, in every circumstance and occurrence of human life. Had not the presence of an object instantly excited the idea of those objects, commonly conjoined with it, all our knowledge must have been limited to the narrow sphere of our memory and senses; and we should never have been able to adjust means to ends, or employ our natural powers, either to the producing of good, or avoiding of evil. Those, who delight in the discovery and contemplation of final causes, have here ample subject to employ their wonder and admiration.
      <br>&emsp;I shall add, for a further confirmation of the foregoing theory, that, as this operation of the mind, by which we infer like effects from like causes, and vice versa, is so essential to the subsistence of all human creatures, it is not probable, that it could be trusted to the fallacious deductions of our reason, which is slow in its operations; appears not, in any degree, during the first years of infancy; and at best is, in every age and period of human life, extremely liable to error and mistake. It is more conformable to the ordinary wisdom of nature to secure so necessary an act of the mind, by some instinct or mechanical tendency, which may be infallible in its operations, may discover itself at the first appearance of life and thought, and may be independent of all the laboured deductions of the understanding. As nature has taught us the use of our limbs, without giving us the knowledge of the muscles and nerves, by which they are actuated; so has she implanted in us an instinct, which carries forward the thought in a correspondent course to that which she has established among external objects; though we are ignorant of those powers and forces, on which this regular course and succession of objects totally depends.
      <br>&emsp;Nothing is more usual than for writers, even, on moral, political, or physical subjects, to distinguish between reason and experience, and to suppose, that these species of argumentation are entirely different from each other. The former are taken for the mere result of our intellectual faculties, which, by considering à priori the nature of things, and examining the effects, that must follow from their operation, establish particular principles of science and philosophy. The latter are supposed to be derived entirely from sense and observation, by which we learn what has actually resulted from the operation of particular objects, and are thence able to infer, what will, for the future, result from them. Thus, for instance, the limitations and restraints of civil government, and a legal constitution, may be defended, either from reason, which reflecting on the great frailty and corruption of human nature, teaches, that no man can safely be trusted with unlimited authority; or from experience and history, which inform us of the enormous abuses, that ambition, in every age and country, has been found to make of so imprudent a confidence.
      <br>&emsp;The same distinction between reason and experience is maintained in all our deliberations concerning the conduct of life; while the experienced statesman, general, physician, or merchant is trusted and followed; and the unpractised novice, with whatever natural talents endowed, neglected and despised. Though it be allowed, that reason may form very plausible conjectures with regard to the consequences of such a particular conduct in such particular circumstances; it is still supposed imperfect, without the assistance of experience, which is alone able to give stability and certainty to the maxims, derived from study and reflection.
      <br>&emsp;But notwithstanding that this distinction be thus universally received, both in the active and speculative scenes of life, I shall not scruple to pronounce, that it is, at bottom, erroneous, at least, superficial.
      <br>&emsp;If we examine those arguments, which, in any of the sciences above-mentioned, are supposed to be the mere effects of reasoning and reflection, they will be found to terminate, at last, in some general principle or conclusion, for which we can assign no reason but observation and experience. The only difference between them and those maxims, which are vulgarly esteemed the result of pure experience, is, that the former cannot be established without some process of thought, and some reflection on what we have observed, in order to distinguish its circumstances, and trace its consequences: Whereas in the latter, the experienced event is exactly and fully similar to that which we infer as the result of any particular situation. The history of a Tiberius or a Nero makes us dread a like tyranny, were our monarchs freed from the restraints of laws and senates: But the observation of any fraud or cruelty in private life is sufficient, with the aid of a little thought, to give us the same apprehension; while it serves as an instance of the general corruption of human nature, and shews us the danger which we must incur by reposing an entire confidence in mankind. In both cases, it is experience which is ultimately the foundation of our inference and conclusion.
      <br>&emsp;There is no man so young and unexperienced, as not to have formed, from observation, many general and just maxims concerning human affairs and the conduct of life; but it must be confessed, that, when a man comes to put these in practice, he will be extremely liable to error, till time and farther experience both enlarge these maxims, and teach him their proper use and application. In every situation or incident, there are many particular and seemingly minute circumstances, which the man of greatest talents is, at first, apt to overlook, though on them the justness of his conclusions, and consequently the prudence of his conduct, entirely depend. Not to mention, that, to a young beginner, the general observations and maxims occur not always on the proper occasions, nor can be immediately applied with due calmness and distinction. The truth is, an unexperienced reasoner could be no reasoner at all, were he absolutely unexperienced; and when we assign that character to any one, we mean it only in a comparative sense, and suppose him possessed of experience, in a smaller and more imperfect degree.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="Probability">
      Though there be no such thing as Chance in the world; our ignorance of the real cause of any event has the same influence on the understanding, and begets a like species of belief or opinion.
      <br>&emsp;There is certainly a probability, which arises from a superiority of chances on any side; and according as this superiority encreases, and surpasses the opposite chances, the probability receives a proportionable encrease, and begets still a higher degree of belief or assent to that side, in which we discover the superiority. If a dye were marked with one figure or number of spots on four sides, and with another figure or number of spots on the two remaining sides, it would be more probable, that the former would turn up than the latter; though, if it had a thousand sides marked in the same manner, and only one side different, the probability would be much higher, and our belief or expectation of the event more steady and secure. This process of the thought or reasoning may seem trivial and obvious; but to those who consider it more narrowly, it may, perhaps, afford matter for curious speculation.
      <br>&emsp;It seems evident, that, when the mind looks forward to discover the event, which may result from the throw of such a dye, it considers the turning up of each particular side as alike probable; and this is the very nature of chance, to render all the particular events, comprehended in it, entirely equal. But finding a greater number of sides concur in the one event than in the other, the mind is carried more frequently to that event, and meets it oftener, in revolving the various possibilities or chances, on which the ultimate result depends. This concurrence of several views in one particular event begets immediately, by an inexplicable contrivance of nature, the sentiment of belief, and gives that event the advantage over its antagonist, which is supported by a smaller number of views, and recurs less frequently to the mind. If we allow, that belief is nothing but a firmer and stronger conception of an object than what attends the mere fictions of the imagination, this operation may, perhaps, in some measure, be accounted for. The concurrence of these several views or glimpses imprints the idea more strongly on the imagination; gives it superior force and vigour; renders its influence on the passions and affections more sensible; and in a word, begets that reliance or security, which constitutes the nature of belief and opinion.
      <br>&emsp;The case is the same with the probability of causes, as with that of chance. There are some causes, which are entirely uniform and constant in producing a particular effect; and no instance has ever yet been found of any failure or irregularity in their operation. Fire has always burned, and water suffocated every human creature: The production of motion by impulse and gravity is an universal law, which has hitherto admitted of no exception. But there are other causes, which have been found more irregular and uncertain; nor has rhubarb always proved a purge, or opium a soporific to every one, who has taken these medicines. It is true, when any cause fails of producing its usual effect, philosophers ascribe not this to any irregularity in nature; but suppose, that some secret causes, in the particular structure of parts, have prevented the operation. Our reasonings, however, and conclusions concerning the event are the same as if this principle had no place. Being determined by custom to transfer the past to the future, in all our inferences; where the past has been entirely regular and uniform, we expect the event with the greatest assurance, and leave no room for any contrary supposition. But where different effects have been found to follow from causes, which are to appearance exactly similar, all these various effects must occur to the mind in transferring the past to the future, and enter into our consideration, when we determine the probability of the event. Though we give the preference to that which has been found most usual, and believe that this effect will exist, we must not overlook the other effects, but must assign to each of them a particular weight and authority, in proportion as we have found it to be more or less frequent. It is more probable, in almost every country of Europe, that there will be frost sometime in January, than that the weather will continue open throughout that whole month; though this probability varies according to the different climates, and approaches to a certainty in the more northern kingdoms. Here then it seems evident, that, when we transfer the past to the future, in order to determine the effect, which will result from any cause, we transfer all the different events, in the same proportion as they have appeared in the past, and conceive one to have existed a hundred times, for instance, another ten times, and another once. As a great number of views do here concur in one event, they fortify and confirm it to the imagination, beget that sentiment which we call belief, and give its object the preference above the contrary event, which is not supported by an equal number of experiments, and recurs not so frequently to the thought in transferring the past to the future. Let any one try to account for this operation of the mind upon any of the received systems of philosophy, and he will be sensible of the difficulty. For my part, I shall think it sufficient, if the present hints excite the curiosity of philosophers, and make them sensible how defective all common theories are in treating of such curious and such sublime subjects.

      The great advantage of the mathematical sciences above the moral consists in this, that the ideas of the former, being sensible, are always clear and determinate, the smallest distinction between them is immediately perceptible, and the same terms are still expressive of the same ideas, without ambiguity or variation. An oval is never mistaken for a circle, nor an hyperbola for an ellipsis. The isosceles and scalenum are distinguished by boundaries more exact than vice and virtue, right and wrong. If any term be defined in geometry, the mind readily, of itself, substitutes, on all occasions, the definition for the term defined: Or even when no definition is employed, the object itself may be presented to the senses, and by that means be steadily and clearly apprehended. But the finer sentiments of the mind, the operations of the understanding, the various agitations of the passions, though really in themselves distinct, easily escape us, when surveyed by reflection; nor is it in our power to recal the original object, as often as we have occasion to contemplate it. Ambiguity, by this means, is gradually introduced into our reasonings: Similar objects are readily taken to be the same: And the conclusion becomes at last very wide of the premises.
      <br>&emsp;One may safely, however, affirm, that, if we consider these sciences in a proper light, their advantages and disadvantages nearly compensate each other, and reduce both of them to a state of equality. If the mind, with greater facility, retains the ideas of geometry clear and determinate, it must carry on a much longer and more intricate chain of reasoning, and compare ideas much wider of each other, in order to reach the abstruser truths of that science. And if moral ideas are apt, without extreme care, to fall into obscurity and confusion, the inferences are always much shorter in these disquisitions, and the intermediate steps, which lead to the conclusion, much fewer than in the sciences which treat of quantity and number. In reality, there is scarcely a proposition in Euclid so simple, as not to consist of more parts, than are to be found in any moral reasoning which runs not into chimera and conceit. Where we trace the principles of the human mind through a few steps, we may be very well satisfied with our progress; considering how soon nature throws a bar to all our enquiries concerning causes, and reduces us to an acknowledgment of our ignorance. The chief obstacle, therefore, to our improvement in the moral or metaphysical sciences is the obscurity of the ideas, and ambiguity of the terms. The principal difficulty in the mathematics is the length of inferences and compass of thought, requisite to the forming of any conclusion. And, perhaps, our progress in natural philosophy is chiefly retarded by the want of proper experiments and phænomena, which are often discovered by chance, and cannot always be found, when requisite, even by the most diligent and prudent enquiry. As moral philosophy seems hitherto to have received less improvement than either geometry or physics, we may conclude, that, if there be any difference in this respect among these sciences, the difficulties, which obstruct the progress of the former, require superior care and capacity to be surmounted.
      <br>&emsp;There are no ideas, which occur in metaphysics, more obscure and uncertain, than those of power, force, energy, or necessary connexion, of which it is every moment necessary for us to treat in all our disquisitions. We shall, therefore, endeavour, in this section, to fix, if possible, the precise meaning of these terms, and thereby remove some part of that obscurity, which is so much complained of in this species of philosophy.
      <br>&emsp;It seems a proposition, which will not admit of much dispute, that all our ideas are nothing but copies of our impressions, or, in other words, that it is impossible for us to think of any thing, which we have not antecedently felt, either by our external or internal senses. I have endeavoured to explain and prove this proposition, and have expressed my hopes, that, by a proper application of it, men may reach a greater clearness and precision in philosophical reasonings, than what they have hitherto been able to attain. Complex ideas may, perhaps, be well known by definition, which is nothing but an enumeration of those parts or simple ideas, that compose them. But when we have pushed up definitions to the most simple ideas, and find still some ambiguity and obscurity; what resource are we then possessed of? By what invention can we throw light upon these ideas, and render them altogether precise and determinate to our intellectual view? Produce the impressions or original sentiments, from which the ideas are copied. These impressions are all strong and sensible. They admit not of ambiguity. They are not only placed in a full light themselves, but may throw light on their correspondent ideas, which lie in obscurity. And by this means, we may, perhaps, attain a new microscope or species of optics, by which, in the moral sciences, the most minute, and most simple ideas may be so enlarged as to fall readily under our apprehension, and be equally known with the grossest and most sensible ideas, that can be the object of our enquiry.
      <br>&emsp;To be fully acquainted, therefore, with the idea of power or necessary connexion, let us examine its impression; and in order to find the impression with greater certainty, let us search for it in all the sources, from which it may possibly be derived.
      <br>&emsp;When we look about us towards external objects, and consider the operation of causes, we are never able, in a single instance, to discover any power or necessary connexion; any quality, which binds the effect to the cause, and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other. We only find, that the one does actually, in fact, follow the other. The impulse of one billiard-ball is attended with motion in the second. This is the whole that appears to the outward senses. The mind feels no sentiment or inward impression from this succession of objects: Consequently, there is not, in any single, particular instance of cause and effect, any thing which can suggest the idea of power or necessary connexion.
      <br>&emsp;From the first appearance of an object, we never can conjecture what effect will result from it. But were the power or energy of any cause discoverable by the mind, we could foresee the effect, even without experience; and might, at first, pronounce with certainty concerning it, by the mere dint of thought and reasoning.
      <br>&emsp;In reality, there is no part of matter, that does ever, by its sensible qualities, discover any power or energy, or give us ground to imagine, that it could produce any thing, or be followed by any other object, which we could denominate its effect. Solidity, extension, motion; these qualities are all complete in themselves, and never point out any other event which may result from them. The scenes of the universe are continually shifting, and one object follows another in an uninterrupted succession; but the power or force, which actuates the whole machine, is entirely concealed from us, and never discovers itself in any of the sensible qualities of body. We know, that, in fact, heat is a constant attendant of flame; but what is the connexion between them, we have no room so much as to conjecture or imagine. It is impossible, therefore, that the idea of power can be derived from the contemplation of bodies, in single instances of their operation; because no bodies ever discover any power, which can be the original of this idea.
      <br>&emsp;Since, therefore, external objects as they appear to the senses, give us no idea of power or necessary connexion, by their operation in particular instances, let us see, whether this idea be derived from reflection on the operations of our own minds, and be copied from any internal impression. It may be said, that we are every moment conscious of internal power; while we feel, that, by the simple command of our will, we can move the organs of our body, or direct the faculties of our mind. An act of volition produces motion in our limbs, or raises a new idea in our imagination. This influence of the will we know by consciousness. Hence we acquire the idea of power or energy; and are certain, that we ourselves and all other intelligent beings are possessed of power. This idea, then, is an idea of reflection, since it arises from reflecting on the operations of our own mind, and on the command which is exercised by will, both over the organs of the body and faculties of the soul.
      <br>&emsp;We shall proceed to examine this pretension; and first with regard to the influence of volition over the organs of the body. This influence, we may observe, is a fact, which, like all other natural events, can be known only by experience, and can never be foreseen from any apparent energy or power in the cause, which connects it with the effect, and renders the one an infallible consequence of the other. The motion of our body follows upon the command of our will. Of this we are every moment conscious. But the means, by which this is effected; the energy, by which the will performs so extraordinary an operation; of this we are so far from being immediately conscious, that it must for ever escape our most diligent enquiry.
      <br>&emsp;For first; is there any principle in all nature more mysterious than the union of soul with body; by which a supposed spiritual substance acquires such an influence over a material one, that the most refined thought is able to actuate the grossest matter? Were we empowered, by a secret wish, to remove mountains, or control the planets in their orbit; this extensive authority would not be more extraordinary, nor more beyond our comprehension. But if by consciousness we perceived any power or energy in the will, we must know this power; we must know its connexion with the effect; we must know the secret union of soul and body, and the nature of both these substances; by which the one is able to operate, in so many instances, upon the other.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly, We are not able to move all the organs of the body with a like authority; though we cannot assign any reason besides experience, for so remarkable a difference between one and the other. Why has the will an influence over the tongue and fingers, not over the heart or liver? This question would never embarrass us, were we conscious of a power in the former case, not in the latter. We should then perceive, independent of experience, why the authority of will over the organs of the body is circumscribed within such particular limits. Being in that case fully acquainted with the power or force, by which it operates, we should also know, why its influence reaches precisely to such boundaries, and no farther.
      <br>&emsp;A man, suddenly struck with a palsy in the leg or arm, or who had newly lost those members, frequently endeavours, at first, to move them, and employ them in their usual offices. Here he is as much conscious of power to command such limbs, as a man in perfect health is conscious of power to actuate any member which remains in its natural state and condition. But consciousness never deceives. Consequently, neither in the one case nor in the other, are we ever conscious of any power. We learn the influence of our will from experience alone. And experience only teaches us, how one event constantly follows another; without instructing us in the secret connexion, which binds them together, and renders them inseparable.
      <br>&emsp;Thirdly, We learn from anatomy, that the immediate object of power in voluntary motion, is not the member itself which is moved, but certain muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits, and, perhaps, something still more minute and more unknown, through which the motion is successively propagated, ere it reach the member itself whose motion is the immediate object of volition. Can there be a more certain proof, that the power, by which this whole operation is performed, so far from being directly and fully known by an inward sentiment or consciousness, is, to the last degree, mysterious and unintelligible? Here the mind wills a certain event: Immediately another event, unknown to ourselves, and totally different from the one intended, is produced: This event produces another, equally unknown: Till at last, through a long succession, the desired event is produced. But if the original power were felt, it must be known: Were it known, its effect must also be known; since all power is relative to its effect. And vice versa, if the effect be not known, the power cannot be known nor felt. How indeed can we be conscious of a power to move our limbs, when we have no such power; but only that to move certain animal spirits, which, though they produce at last the motion of our limbs, yet operate in such a manner as is wholly beyond our comprehension?
      <br>&emsp;We may, therefore, conclude from the whole, I hope, without any temerity, though with assurance; that our idea of power is not copied from any sentiment or consciousness of power within ourselves, when we give rise to animal motion, or apply our limbs to their proper use and office. That their motion follows the command of the will is a matter of common experience, like other natural events: But the power or energy by which this is effected, like that in other natural events, is unknown and inconceivable.
      <br>&emsp;Shall we then assert, that we are conscious of a power or energy in our own minds, when, by an act or command of our will, we raise up a new idea, fix the mind to the contemplation of it, turn it on all sides, and at last dismiss it for some other idea, when we think that we have surveyed it with sufficient accuracy? I believe the same arguments will prove, that even this command of the will gives us no real idea of force or energy.
      <br>&emsp;First, It must be allowed, that, when we know a power, we know that very circumstance in the cause, by which it is enabled to produce the effect: For these are supposed to be synonimous. We must, therefore, know both the cause and effect, and the relation between them. But do we pretend to be acquainted with the nature of the human soul and the nature of an idea, or the aptitude of the one to produce the other? This is a real creation; a production of something out of nothing: Which implies a power so great, that it may seem, at first sight, beyond the reach of any being, less than infinite. At least it must be owned, that such a power is not felt, nor known, nor even conceivable by the mind. We only feel the event, namely, the existence of an idea, consequent to a command of the will: But the manner, in which this operation is performed; the power, by which it is produced; is entirely beyond our comprehension.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly, The command of the mind over itself is limited, as well as its command over the body; and these limits are not known by reason, or any acquaintance with the nature of cause and effect; but only by experience and observation, as in all other natural events and in the operation of external objects. Our authority over our sentiments and passions is much weaker than that over our ideas; and even the latter authority is circumscribed within very narrow boundaries. Will any one pretend to assign the ultimate reason of these boundaries, or show why the power is deficient in one case not in another.
      <br>&emsp;Thirdly, This self-command is very different at different times. A man in health possesses more of it, than one languishing with sickness. We are more master of our thoughts in the morning than in the evening: Fasting, than after a full meal. Can we give any reason for these variations, except experience? Where then is the power, of which we pretend to be conscious? Is there not here, either in a spiritual or material substance, or both, some secret mechanism or structure of parts, upon which the effect depends, and which, being entirely unknown to us, renders the power or energy of the will equally unknown and incomprehensible?
      <br>&emsp;Volition is surely an act of the mind, with which we are sufficiently acquainted. Reflect upon it. Consider it on all sides. Do you find any thing in it like this creative power, by which it raises from nothing a new idea, and with a kind of Fiat, imitates the omnipotence of its Maker, if I may be allowed so to speak, who called forth into existence all the various scenes of nature? So far from being conscious of this energy in the will, it requires as certain experience, as that of which we are possessed, to convince us, that such extraordinary effects do ever result from a simple act of volition.
      <br>&emsp;The generality of mankind never find any difficulty in accounting for the more common and familiar operations of nature; such as the descent of heavy bodies, the growth of plants, the generation of animals, or the nourishment of bodies by food: But suppose, that, in all these cases, they perceive the very force or energy of the cause, by which it is connected with its effect, and is for ever infallible in its operation. They acquire, by long habit, such a turn of mind, that, upon the appearance of the cause, they immediately expect with assurance its usual attendant, and hardly conceive it possible, that any other event could result from it. It is only on the discovery of extraordinary phænomena, such as earthquakes, pestilence, and prodigies of any kind, that they find themselves at a loss to assign a proper cause, and to explain the manner, in which the effect is produced by it. It is usual for men, in such difficulties, to have recourse to some invisible intelligent principle, as the immediate cause of that event, which surprises them, and which, they think, cannot be accounted for from the common powers of nature. But philosophers, who carry their scrutiny a little farther, immediately perceive, that, even in the most familiar events, the energy of the cause is as unintelligible as in the most unusual, and that we only learn by experience the frequent Conjunction of objects, without being ever able to comprehend any thing like Connection between them. Here then, many philosophers think themselves obliged by reason to have recourse, on all occasions, to the same principle, which the vulgar never appeal to but in cases, that appear miraculous and supernatural. They acknowledge mind and intelligence to be, not only the ultimate and original cause of all things, but the immediate and sole cause of every event, which appears in nature. They pretend, that those objects, which are commonly denominated causes, are in reality nothing but occasions; and that the true and direct principle of every effect is not any power or force in nature, but a volition of the Supreme Being, who wills, that such particular objects should, for ever, be conjoined with each other. Instead of saying, that one billiard-ball moves another, by a force, which it has derived from the author of nature; it is the Deity himself, they say, who, by a particular volition, moves the second ball, being determined to this operation by the impulse of the first ball; in consequence of those general laws, which he has laid down to himself in the government of the universe. But philosophers advancing still in their enquiries, discover, that, as we are totally ignorant of the power, on which depends the mutual operation of bodies, we are no less ignorant of that power, on which depends the operation of mind on body, or of body on mind; nor are we able, either from our senses or consciousness, to assign the ultimate principle in one case, more than in the other. The same ignorance, therefore, reduces them to the same conclusion. They assert, that the Deity is the immediate cause of the union between soul and body; and that they are not the organs of sense, which, being agitated by external objects, produce sensations in the mind; but that it is a particular volition of our omnipotent Maker, which excites such a sensation, in consequence of such a motion in the organ. In like manner, it is not any energy in the will, that produces local motion in our members: It is God himself, who is pleased to second our will, in itself impotent, and to command that motion, which we erroneously attribute to our own power and efficacy. Nor do philosophers stop at this conclusion. They sometimes extend the same inference to the mind itself, in its internal operations. Our mental vision or conception of ideas is nothing but a revelation made to us by our Maker. When we voluntarily turn our thoughts to any object, and raise up its image in the fancy; it is not the will which creates that idea: It is the universal Creator, who discovers it to the mind, and renders it present to us.
      <br>&emsp;Thus, according to these philosophers, every thing is full of God. Not content with the principle, that nothing exists but by his will, that nothing possesses any power but by his concession: They rob nature, and all created beings, of every power, in order to render their dependence on the Deity still more sensible and immediate. They consider not, that, by this theory, they diminish, instead of magnifying, the grandeur of those attributes, which they affect so much to celebrate. It argues surely more power in the Deity to delegate a certain degree of power to inferior creatures, than to produce every thing by his own immediate volition. It argues more wisdom to contrive at first the fabric of the world with such perfect foresight, that, of itself, and by its proper operation, it may serve all the purposes of providence, than if the great Creator were obliged every moment to adjust its parts, and animate by his breath all the wheels of that stupendous machine.
      <br>&emsp;But if we would have a more philosophical confutation of this theory, perhaps the two following reflections may suffice.
      <br>&emsp;First, It seems to me, that this theory of the universal energy and operation of the Supreme Being, is too bold ever to carry conviction with it to a man, sufficiently apprized of the weakness of human reason, and the narrow limits, to which it is confined in all its operations. Though the chain of arguments, which conduct to it, were ever so logical, there must arise a strong suspicion, if not an absolute assurance, that it has carried us quite beyond the reach of our faculties, when it leads to conclusions so extraordinary, and so remote from common life and experience. We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory; and there we have no reason to trust our common methods of argument, or to think that our usual analogies and probabilities have any authority. Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses. And however we may flatter ourselves, that we are guided, in every step which we take, by a kind of verisimilitude and experience; we may be assured, that this fancied experience has no authority, when we thus apply it to subjects, that lie entirely out of the sphere of experience. But on this we shall have occasion to touch afterwards.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly, I cannot perceive any force in the arguments, on which this theory is founded. We are ignorant, it is true, of the manner in which bodies operate on each other: Their force or energy is entirely incomprehensible: But are we not equally ignorant of the manner or force by which a mind, even the supreme mind, operates either on itself or on body? Whence, I beseech you, do we acquire any idea of it? We have no sentiment or consciousness of this power in ourselves. We have no idea of the Supreme Being but what we learn from reflection on our own faculties. Were our ignorance, therefore, a good reason for rejecting any thing, we should be led into that principle of denying all energy in the Supreme Being as much as in the grossest matter. We surely comprehend as little the operations of one as of the other. Is it more difficult to conceive, that motion may arise from impulse, than that it may arise from volition? All we know is our profound ignorance in both cases.
      <br>&emsp;Part Ii.
      <br>&emsp;But to hasten to a conclusion of this argument, which is already drawn out to too great a length: We have sought in vain for an idea of power or necessary connexion, in all the sources from which we could suppose it to be derived. It appears, that, in single instances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost scrutiny, discover any thing but one event following another; without being able to comprehend any force or power, by which the cause operates, or any connexion between it and its supposed effect. The same difficulty occurs in contemplating the operations of mind on body; where we observe the motion of the latter to follow upon the volition of the former; but are not able to observe or conceive the tye, which binds together the motion and volition, or the energy by which the mind produces this effect. The authority of the will over its own faculties and ideas is not a whit more comprehensible: So that, upon the whole, there appears not, throughout all nature, any one instance of connexion, which is conceivable by us. All events seem entirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never can observe any tye between them. They seem conjoined, but never connected. And as we can have no idea of any thing, which never appeared to our outward sense or inward sentiment, the necessary conclusion seems to be, that we have no idea of connexion or power at all, and that these words are absolutely without any meaning, when employed either in philosophical reasonings, or common life.
      <br>&emsp;But there still remains one method of avoiding this conclusion, and one source which we have not yet examined. When any natural object or event is presented, it is impossible for us, by any sagacity or penetration, to discover, or even conjecture, without experience, what event will result from it, or to carry our foresight beyond that object, which is immediately present to the memory and senses. Even after one instance or experiment, where we have observed a particular event to follow upon another, we are not entitled to form a general rule, or foretel what will happen in like cases; it being justly esteemed an unpardonable temerity to judge of the whole course of nature from one single experiment, however accurate or certain. But when one particular species of event has always, in all instances, been conjoined with another, we make no longer any scruple of foretelling one upon the appearance of the other, and of employing that reasoning, which can alone assure us of any matter of fact or existence. We then call the one object, Cause; the other, Effect. We suppose, that there is some connexion between them; some power in the one, by which it infallibly produces the other, and operates with the greatest certainty and strongest necessity.
      <br>&emsp;It appears, then, that this idea of a necessary connexion among events arises from a number of similar instances which occur, of the constant conjunction of these events; nor can that idea ever be suggested by any one of these instances, surveyed in all possible lights and positions. But there is nothing in a number of instances, different from every single instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar; except only, that after a repetition of similar instances, the mind is carried by habit, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its usual attendant, and to believe, that it will exist. This connexion, therefore, which we feel in the mind, this customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant, is the sentiment or impression, from which we form the idea of power or necessary connexion. Nothing farther is in the case. Contemplate the subject on all sides; you will never find any other origin of that idea. This is the sole difference between one instance, from which we can never receive the idea of connexion, and a number of similar instances, by which it is suggested. The first time a man saw the communication of motion by impulse, as by the shock of two billiard-balls, he could not pronounce that the one event was connected: but only that it was conjoined with the other. After he has observed several instances of this nature, he then pronounces them to be connected. What alteration has happened to give rise to this new idea of connexion? Nothing but that he now feels these events to be connected in his imagination, and can readily foretel the existence of one from the appearance of the other. When we say, therefore, that one object is connected with another, we mean only, that they have acquired a connexion in our thought, and give rise to this inference, by which they become proofs of each other's existence: A conclusion, which is somewhat extraordinary; but which seems founded on sufficient evidence. Nor will its evidence be weakened by any general diffidence of the understanding, or sceptical suspicion concerning every conclusion, which is new and extraordinary. No conclusions can be more agreeable to scepticism than such as make discoveries concerning the weakness and narrow limits of human reason and capacity.
      <br>&emsp;And what stronger instance can be produced of the surprising ignorance and weakness of the understanding, than the present? For surely, if there be any relation among objects, which it imports to us to know perfectly, it is that of cause and effect. On this are founded all our reasonings concerning matter of fact or existence. By means of it alone we attain any assurance concerning objects, which are removed from the present testimony of our memory and senses. The only immediate utility of all sciences, is to teach us, how to control and regulate future events by their causes. Our thoughts and enquiries are, therefore, every moment, employed about this relation: Yet so imperfect are the ideas which we form concerning it, that it is impossible to give any just definition of cause, except what is drawn from something extraneous and foreign to it. Similar objects are always conjoined with similar. Of this we have experience. Suitably to this experience, therefore, we may define a cause to be an object, followed by another, and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second. Or in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed. The appearance of a cause always conveys the mind, by a customary transition, to the idea of the effect. Of this also we have experience. We may, therefore, suitably to this experience, form another definition of cause; and call it, an object followed by another, and whose appearance always conveys the thought to that other. But though both these definitions be drawn from circumstances foreign to the cause, we cannot remedy this inconvenience, or attain any more perfect definition, which may point out that circumstance in the cause, which gives it a connexion with its effect. We have no idea of this connexion; nor even any distinct notion what it is we desire to know, when we endeavour at a conception of it. We say, for instance, that the vibration of this string is the cause of this particular sound. But what do we mean by that affirmation? We either mean, that this vibration is followed by this sound, and that all similar vibrations have been followed by similar sounds: Or, that this vibration is followed by this sound, and that upon the appearance of one, the mind anticipates the senses, and forms immediately an idea of the other. We may consider the relation of cause and effect in either of these two lights; but beyond these, we have no idea of it.
      <br>&emsp;To recapitulate, therefore, the reasonings of this section: Every idea is copied from some preceding impression or sentiment; and where we cannot find any impression, we may be certain that there is no idea. In all single instances of the operation of bodies or minds, there is nothing that produces any impression, nor consequently can suggest any idea, of power or necessary connexion. But when many uniform instances appear, and the same object is always followed by the same event; we then begin to entertain the notion of cause and connexion. We then feel a new sentiment or impression, to wit, a customary connexion in the thought or imagination between one object and its usual attendant; and this sentiment is the original of that idea which we seek for. For as this idea arises from a number of similar instances, and not from any single instance; it must arise from that circumstance, in which the number of instances differ from every individual instance. But this customary connexion or transition of the imagination is the only circumstance, in which they differ. In every other particular they are alike. The first instance which we saw of motion, communicated by the shock of two billiard-balls (to return to this obvious illustration) is exactly similar to any instance that may, at present, occur to us; except only, that we could not, at first, infer one event from the other; which we are enabled to do at present, after so long a course of uniform experience. I know not, whether the reader will readily apprehend this reasoning. I am afraid, that, should I multiply words about it, or throw it into a greater variety of lights, it would only become more obscure and intricate. In all abstract reasonings, there is one point of view, which, if we can happily hit, we shall go farther towards illustrating the subject, than by all the eloquence and copious expression in the world. This point of view we should endeavour to reach, and reserve the flowers of rhetoric for subjects which are more adapted to them.
      
      <br>&emsp;Section Ii.
      <br>&emsp;Mr. Locke, in his chapter of power, says, that, finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power. But no reasoning can ever give us a new, original, simple idea; as this philosopher himself confesses. This, therefore, can never be the origin of that idea.
      <br>&emsp;It may be pretended, that the resistance which we meet with in bodies, obliging us frequently to exert our force, and call up all our power, this gives us the idea of force and power. It is this nisus or strong endeavour, of which we are conscious, that is the original impression from which this idea is copied. But, first, we attribute power to a vast number of objects, where we never can suppose this resistance or exertion of force to take place; to the Supreme Being, who never meets with any resistance; to the mind in its command over its ideas and limbs, in common thinking and motion, where the effect follows immediately upon the will, without any exertion or summoning up of force; to inanimate matter, which is not capable of this sentiment. Secondly, This sentiment of an endeavour to overcome resistance has no known connexion with any event: What follows it, we know by experience; but could not know it à priori. It must, however, be confessed, that the animal nisus, which we experience, though it can afford no accurate precise idea of power, enters very much into that vulgar, inaccurate idea, which is formed of it.
      <br>&emsp;Ineed not examine at length the vis inertiæ which is so much talked of in the new philosophy, and which is ascribed to matter. We find by experience, that a body at rest or in motion continues for ever in its present state, till put from it by some new cause; and that a body impelled takes as much motion from the impelling body as it acquires itself. These are facts. When we call this a vis inertiæ, we only mark these facts, without pretending to have any idea of the inert power; in the same manner as, when we talk of gravity, we mean certain effects, without comprehending that active power. It was never the meaning of Sir Isaac Newton to rob second causes of all force or energy; though some of his followers have endeavoured to establish that theory upon his authority. On the contrary, that great philosopher had recourse to an etherial active fluid to explain his universal attraction; though he was so cautious and modest as to allow, that it was a mere hypothesis, not to be insisted on, without more experiments. I must confess, that there is something in the fate of opinions a little extraordinary. Des Cartes insinuated that doctrine of the universal and sole efficacy of the Deity, without insisting on it. Malebranche and other Cartesians made it the foundation of all their philosophy. It had, however, no authority in England. Locke, Clarke, and Cudworth, never so much as take notice of it, but suppose all along, that matter has a real, though subordinate and derived power. By what means has it become so prevalent among our modern metaphysicians?
      <br>&emsp;According to these explications and definitions, the idea of power is relative as much as that of cause; and both have a reference to an effect, or some other event constantly conjoined with the former. When we consider the unknown circumstance of an object, by which the degree or quantity of its effect is fixed and determined, we call that its power: And accordingly, it is allowed by all philosophers, that the effect is the measure of the power. But if they had any idea of power, as it is in itself, why could not they measure it in itself? The dispute whether the force of a body in motion be as its velocity, or the square of its velocity; this dispute, I say, needed not be decided by comparing its effects in equal or unequal times; but by a direct mensuration and comparison.
      <br>&emsp;As to the frequent use of the words, Force, Power, Energy, &c. which every where occur in common conversation, as well as in philosophy; that is no proof, that we are acquainted, in any instance, with the connecting principle between cause and effect, or can account ultimately for the production of one thing by another. These words, as commonly used, have very loose meanings annexed to them; and their ideas are very uncertain and confused. No animal can put external bodies in motion without the sentiment of a nisus or endeavour; and every animal has a sentiment or feeling from the stroke or blow of an external object, that is in motion. These sensations, which are merely animal, and from which we can à priori draw no inference, we are apt to transfer to inanimate objects, and to suppose, that they have some such feelings, whenever they transfer or receive motion. With regard to energies, which are exerted, without our annexing to them any idea of communicated motion, we consider only the constant experienced conjunction of the events; and as we feel a customary connexion between the ideas, we transfer that feeling to the objects; as nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies every internal sensation, which they occasion.

      It might reasonably be expected, in questions, which have been canvassed and disputed with great eagerness, since the first origin of science and philosophy, that the meaning of all the terms, at least, should have been agreed upon among the disputants; and our enquiries, in the course of two thousand years, been able to pass from words to the true and real subject of the controversy. For how easy may it seem to give exact definitions of the terms employed in reasoning, and make these definitions, not the mere sound of words, the object of future scrutiny and examination? But if we consider the matter more narrowly, we shall be apt to draw a quite opposite conclusion. From this circumstance alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot, and remains still undecided, we may presume, that there is some ambiguity in the expression, and that the disputants affix different ideas to the terms employed in the controversy. For as the faculties of the mind are supposed to be naturally alike in every individual; otherwise nothing could be more fruitless than to reason or dispute together; it were impossible, if men affix the same ideas to their terms, that they could so long form different opinions of the same subject; especially when they communicate their views, and each party turn themselves on all sides, in search of arguments, which may give them the victory over their antagonists. It is true; if men attempt the discussion of questions, which lie entirely beyond the reach of human capacity, such as those concerning the origin of worlds, or the œconomy of the intellectual system or region of spirits, they may long beat the air in their fruitless contests, and never arrive at any determinate conclusion. But if the question regard any subject of common life and experience; nothing, one would think, could preserve the dispute so long undecided, but some ambiguous expressions, which keep the antagonists still at a distance, and hinder them from grappling with each other.
      <br>&emsp;This has been the case in the long disputed question concerning liberty and necessity; and to so remarkable a degree, that, if I be not much mistaken, we shall find, that all mankind, both learned and ignorant, have always been of the same opinion with regard to this subject, and that a few intelligible definitions would immediately have put an end to the whole controversy. I own, that this dispute has been so much canvassed on all hands, and has led philosophers into such a labyrinth of obscure sophistry, that it is no wonder, if a sensible reader indulge his ease so far as to turn a deaf ear to the proposal of such a question, from which he can expect neither instruction nor entertainment. But the state of the argument here proposed may, perhaps, serve to renew his attention; as it has more novelty, promises at least some decision of the controversy, and will not much disturb his ease by any intricate or obscure reasoning.
      <br>&emsp;I hope, therefore, to make it appear, that all men have ever agreed in the doctrine both of necessity and of liberty, according to any reasonable sense, which can be put on these terms; and that the whole controversy has hitherto turned merely upon words. We shall begin with examining the doctrine of necessity.
      <br>&emsp;It is universally allowed, that matter, in all its operations, is actuated by a necessary force, and that every natural effect is so precisely determined by the energy of its cause, that no other effect, in such particular circumstances, could possibly have resulted from it. The degree and direction of every motion is, by the laws of nature, prescribed with such exactness, that a living creature may as soon arise from the shock of two bodies, as motion, in any other degree or direction than what is actually produced by it. Would we, therefore, form a just and precise idea of necessity, we must consider whence that idea arises, when we apply it to the operation of bodies.
      <br>&emsp;It seems evident, that, if all the scenes of nature were continually shifted in such a manner, that no two events bore any resemblance to each other, but every object was entirely new, without any similitude to whatever had been seen before, we should never, in that case, have attained the least idea of necessity, or of a connexion among these objects. We might say, upon such a supposition, that one object or event has followed another; not that one was produced by the other. The relation of cause and effect must be utterly unknown to mankind. Inference and reasoning concerning the operations of nature would, from that moment, be at an end; and the memory and senses remain the only canals, by which the knowledge of any real existence could possibly have access to the mind. Our idea, therefore, of necessity and causation arises entirely from the uniformity, observable in the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined together, and the mind is determined by custom to infer the one from the appearance of the other. These two circumstances form the whole of that necessity, which we ascribe to matter. Beyond the constant conjunction of similar objects, and the consequent inference from one to the other, we have no notion of any necessity, or connexion.
      <br>&emsp;If it appear, therefore, that all mankind have ever allowed, without any doubt or hesitation, that these two circumstances take place in the voluntary actions of men, and in the operations of mind; it must follow, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of necessity, and that they have hitherto disputed, merely for not understanding each other.
      <br>&emsp;As to the first circumstance, the constant and regular conjunction of similar events; we may possibly satisfy ourselves by the following considerations. It is universally acknowledged, that there is a great uniformity among the actions of men, in all nations and ages, and that human nature remains still the same, in its principles and operations. The same motives always produce the same actions: The same events follow from the same causes. Ambition, avarice, self-love, vanity, friendship, generosity, public spirit; these passions, mixed in various degrees, and distributed through society, have been, from the beginning of the world, and still are, the source of all the actions and enterprizes, which have ever been observed among mankind. Would you know the sentiments, inclinations, and course of life of the Greeks and Romans? Study well the temper and actions of the French and English: You cannot be much mistaken in transferring to the former most of the observations, which you have made with regard to the latter. Mankind are so much the same, in all times and places, that history informs us of nothing new or strange in this particular. Its chief use is only to discover the constant and universal principles of human nature, by shewing men in all varieties of circumstances and situations, and furnishing us with materials, from which we may form our observations, and become acquainted with the regular springs of human action and behaviour. These records of wars, intrigues, factions, and revolutions, are so many collections of experiments, by which the politician or moral philosopher fixes the principles of his science; in the same manner as the physician or natural philosopher becomes acquainted with the nature of plants, minerals, and other external objects, by the experiments, which he forms concerning them. Nor are the earth, water, and other elements, examined by Aristotle, and Hippocrates, more like to those, which at present lie under our observation, than the men, described by Polybius and Tacitus, are to those who now govern the world.
      <br>&emsp;Should a traveller, returning from a far country, bring us an account of men, wholly different from any, with whom we were ever acquainted; men, who were entirely divested of avarice, ambition, or revenge; who knew no pleasure but friendship, generosity, and public spirit; we should immediately, from these circumstances, detect the falsehood, and prove him a liar, with the same certainty as if he had stuffed his narration with stories of centaurs and dragons, miracles and prodigies. And if we would explode any forgery in history, we cannot make use of a more convincing argument, than to prove, that the actions, ascribed to any person, are directly contrary to the course of nature, and that no human motives, in such circumstances, could ever induce him to such a conduct. The veracity of Quintus Curtius is as much to be suspected, when he describes the supernatural courage of Alexander, by which he was hurried on singly to attack multitudes, as when he describes his supernatural force and activity, by which he was able to resist them. So readily and universally do we acknowledge a uniformity in human motives and actions as well as in the operations of body.
      <br>&emsp;Hence likewise the benefit of that experience, acquired by long life and a variety of business and company, in order to instruct us in the principles of human nature, and regulate our future conduct, as well as speculation. By means of this guide, we mount up to the knowledge of men's inclinations and motives, from their actions, expressions, and even gestures; and again, descend to the interpretation of their actions from our knowledge of their motives and inclinations. The general observations, treasured up by a course of experience, give us the clue of human nature, and teach us to unravel all its intricacies. Pretexts and appearances no longer deceive us. Public declarations pass for the specious colouring of a cause. And though virtue and honour be allowed their proper weight and authority, that perfect disinterestedness, so often pretended to, is never expected in multitudes and parties; seldom in their leaders; and scarcely even in individuals of any rank or station. But were there no uniformity in human actions, and were every experiment, which we could form of this kind, irregular and anomalous, it were impossible to collect any general observations concerning mankind; and no experience, however accurately digested by reflection, would ever serve to any purpose. Why is the aged husbandman more skilful in his calling than the young beginner, but because there is a certain uniformity in the operation of the sun, rain, and earth, towards the production of vegetables; and experience teaches the old practitioner the rules, by which this operation is governed and directed?
      <br>&emsp;We must not, however, expect, that this uniformity of human actions should be carried to such a length, as that all men, in the same circumstances, will always act precisely in the same manner, without making any allowance for the diversity of characters, prejudices, and opinions. Such a uniformity in every particular, is found in no part of nature. On the contrary, from observing the variety of conduct in different men, we are enabled to form a greater variety of maxims, which still suppose a degree of uniformity and regularity.
      <br>&emsp;Are the manners of men different in different ages and countries? We learn thence the great force of custom and education, which mould the human mind from its infancy, and form it into a fixed and established character. Is the behaviour and conduct of the one sex very unlike that of the other? It is thence we become acquainted with the different characters, which nature has impressed upon the sexes, and which she preserves with constancy and regularity. Are the actions of the same person much diversified in the different periods of his life, from infancy to old age? This affords room for many general observations concerning the gradual change of our sentiments and inclinations, and the different maxims, which prevail in the different ages of human creatures. Even the characters, which are peculiar to each individual, have a uniformity in their influence; otherwise our acquaintance with the persons and our observation of their conduct, could never teach us their dispositions, or serve to direct our behaviour with regard to them.
      <br>&emsp;I grant it possible to find some actions, which seem to have no regular connexion with any known motives, and are exceptions to all the measures of conduct, which have ever been established for the government of men. But if we would willingly know, what judgment should be formed of such irregular and extraordinary actions; we may consider the sentiments, commonly entertained with regard to those irregular events, which appear in the course of nature, and the operations of external objects. All causes are not conjoined to their usual effects, with like uniformity. An artificer, who handles only dead matter, may be disappointed of his aim, as well as the politician, who directs the conduct of sensible and intelligent agents.
      <br>&emsp;The vulgar, who take things according to their first appearance, attribute the uncertainty of events to such an uncertainty in the causes as makes the latter often fail of their usual influence; though they meet with no impediment in their operation. But philosophers, observing, that, almost in every part of nature, there is contained a vast variety of springs and principles, which are hid, by reason of their minuteness or remoteness, find, that it is at least possible the contrariety of events may not proceed from any contingency in the cause, but from the secret operation of contrary causes. This possibility is converted into certainty by farther observation; when they remark, that, upon an exact scrutiny, a contrariety of effects always betrays a contrariety of causes, and proceeds from their mutual opposition. A peasant can give no better reason for the stopping of any clock or watch than to say that it does not commonly go right: But an artist easily perceives, that the same force in the spring or pendulum has always the same influence on the wheels; but fails of its usual effect, perhaps by reason of a grain of dust, which puts a stop to the whole movement. From the observation of several parallel instances, philosophers form a maxim, that the connexion between all causes and effects is equally necessary, and that its seeming uncertainty in some instances proceeds from the secret opposition of contrary causes.
      <br>&emsp;Thus for instance, in the human body, when the usual symptoms of health or sickness disappoint our expectation; when medicines operate not with their wonted powers; when irregular events follow from any particular cause; the philosopher and physician are not surprized at the matter, nor are ever tempted to deny, in general, the necessity and uniformity of those principles, by which the animal œconomy is conducted. They know, that a human body is a mighty complicated machine: That many secret powers lurk in it, which are altogether beyond our comprehension: That to us it must often appear very uncertain in its operations: And that therefore the irregular events, which outwardly discover themselves, can be no proof, that the laws of nature are not observed with the greatest regularity in its internal operations and government.
      <br>&emsp;The philosopher, if he be consistent, must apply the same reasoning to the actions and volitions of intelligent agents. The most irregular and unexpected resolutions of men may frequently be accounted for by those, who know every particular circumstance of their character and situation. A person of an obliging disposition gives a peevish answer: But he has the toothake, or has not dined. A stupid fellow discovers an uncommon alacrity in his carriage: But he has met with a sudden piece of good fortune. Or even when an action, as sometimes happens, cannot be particularly accounted for, either by the person himself or by others; we know, in general, that the characters of men are, to a certain degree, inconstant and irregular. This is, in a manner, the constant character of human nature; though it be applicable, in a more particular manner, to some persons, who have no fixed rule for their conduct, but proceed in a continued course of caprice and inconstancy. The internal principles and motives may operate in a uniform manner, notwithstanding these seeming irregularities; in the same manner as the winds, rain, clouds, and other variations of the weather are supposed to be governed by steady principles; though not easily discoverable by human sagacity and enquiry.
      <br>&emsp;Thus it appears, not only that the conjunction between motives and voluntary actions is as regular and uniform, as that between the cause and effect in any part of nature; but also that this regular conjunction has been universally acknowledged among mankind, and has never been the subject of dispute, either in philosophy or common life. Now, as it is from past experience, that we draw all inferences concerning the future, and as we conclude, that objects will always be conjoined together, which we find to have always been conjoined; it may seem superfluous to prove, that this experienced uniformity in human actions is a source, whence we draw inferences concerning them. But in order to throw the argument into a greater variety of lights, we shall also insist, though briefly, on this latter topic.
      <br>&emsp;The mutual dependence of men is so great, in all societies, that scarce any human action is entirely compleat in itself, or is performed without some reference to the actions of others, which are requisite to make it answer fully the intention of the agent. The poorest artificer, who labours alone, expects at least the protection of the magistrate, to ensure him the enjoyment of the fruits of his labour. He also expects, that, when he carries his goods to market, and offers them at a reasonable price, he shall find purchasers; and shall be able, by the money he acquires, to engage others to supply him with those commodities, which are requisite for his subsistence. In proportion as men extend their dealings, and render their intercourse with others more complicated, they always comprehend, in their schemes of life, a greater variety of voluntary actions, which they expect, from the proper motives, to co-operate with their own. In all these conclusions, they take their measures from past experience, in the same manner as in their reasonings concerning external objects; and firmly believe, that men, as well as all the elements, are to continue, in their operations, the same, that they have ever found them. A manufacturer reckons upon the labour of his servants, for the execution of any work, as much as upon the tools, which he employs, and would be equally surprized, were his expectations disappointed. In short, this experimental inference and reasoning concerning the actions of others enters so much into human life, that no man, while awake, is ever a moment without employing it. Have we not reason, therefore, to affirm, that all mankind have always agreed in the doctrine of necessity, according to the foregoing definition and explication of it?
      <br>&emsp;Nor have philosophers ever entertained a different opinion from the people in this particular. For not to mention, that almost every action of their life supposes that opinion; there are even few of the speculative parts of learning, to which it is not essential. What would become of history, had we not a dependence on the veracity of the historian, according to the experience, which we have had of mankind? How could politics be a science, if laws and forms of government had not a uniform influence upon society? Where would be the foundation of morals, if particular characters had no certain or determinate power to produce particular sentiments, and if these sentiments had no constant operation on actions? And with what pretence could we employ our criticism upon any poet or polite author, if we could not pronounce the conduct and sentiments of his actors, either natural or unnatural, to such characters, and in such circumstances? It seems almost impossible, therefore, to engage, either in science or action of any kind, without acknowledging the doctrine of necessity, and this inference from motives to voluntary actions; from characters to conduct.
      <br>&emsp;And indeed, when we consider how aptly natural and moral evidence link together, and form only one chain of argument, we shall make no scruple to allow, that they are of the same nature, and derived from the same principles. A prisoner, who has neither money nor interest, discovers the impossibility of his escape, as well when he considers the obstinacy of the gaoler, as the walls and bars, with which he is surrounded; and, in all attempts for his freedom, chuses rather to work upon the stone and iron of the one, than upon the inflexible nature of the other. The same prisoner, when conducted to the scaffold, foresees his death as certainly from the constancy and fidelity of his guards, as from the operation of the ax or wheel. His mind runs along a certain train of ideas: The refusal of the soldiers to consent to his escape; the action of the executioner; the separation of the head and body; bleeding, convulsive motions, and death. Here is a connected chain of natural causes and voluntary actions; but the mind feels no difference between them, in passing from one link to another: Nor is less certain of the future event than if it were connected with the objects present to the memory or senses, by a train of causes, cemented together by what we are pleased to call a physical necessity. The same experienced union has the same effect on the mind, whether the united objects be motives, volition, and actions; or figure and motion. We may change the names of things; but their nature and their operation on the understanding never change.
      <br>&emsp;Were a man, whom I know to be honest and opulent, and with whom I live in intimate friendship, to come into my house, where I am surrounded with my servants, I rest assured, that he is not to stab me before he leaves it, in order to rob me of my silver standish; and I no more suspect this event, than the falling of the house itself, which is new, and solidly built and founded. — But he may have been seized with a sudden and unknown frenzy. — So may a sudden earthquake arise, and shake and tumble my house about my ears. I shall therefore change the suppositions. I shall say, that I know with certainty, that he is not to put his hand into the fire, and hold it there, till it be consumed: And this event, I think I can foretell with the same assurance, as that, if he throw himself out at the window, and meet with no obstruction, he will not remain a moment suspended in the air. No suspicion of an unknown frenzy can give the least possibility to the former event, which is so contrary to all the known principles of human nature. A man who at noon leaves his purse full of gold on the pavement at Charing-Cross, may as well expect that it will fly away like a feather, as that he will find it untouched an hour after. Above one half of human reasonings contain inferences of a similar nature, attended with more or less degrees of certainty, proportioned to our experience of the usual conduct of mankind in such particular situations.
      <br>&emsp;I have frequently considered, what could possibly be the reason, why all mankind, though they have ever, without hesitation, acknowledged the doctrine of necessity, in their whole practice and reasoning, have yet discovered such a reluctance to acknowledge it in words, and have rather shewn a propensity, in all ages, to profess the contrary opinion. The matter, I think, may be accounted for, after the following manner. If we examine the operations of body, and the production of effects from their causes, we shall find, that all our faculties can never carry us farther in our knowledge of this relation, than barely to observe, that particular objects are constantly conjoined together, and that the mind is carried, by a customary transition, from the appearance of one to the belief of the other. But though this conclusion concerning human ignorance be the result of the strictest scrutiny of this subject, men still entertain a strong propensity to believe, that they penetrate farther into the powers of nature, and perceive something like a necessary connexion between the cause and the effect. When again they turn their reflections towards the operations of their own minds, and feel no such connexion of the motive and the action; they are thence apt to suppose, that there is a difference between the effects, which result from material force, and those which arise from thought and intelligence. But being once convinced, that we know nothing farther of causation of any kind, than merely the constant conjunction of objects, and the consequent inference of the mind from one to another, and finding, that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary actions; we may be more easily led to own the same necessity common to all causes. And though this reasoning may contradict the systems of many philosophers, in ascribing necessity to the determinations of the will, we shall find, upon reflection, that they dissent from it in words only, not in their real sentiment. Necessity, according to the sense, in which it is here taken, has never yet been rejected, nor can ever, I think, be rejected by any philosopher. It may only, perhaps, be pretended, that the mind can perceive, in the operations of matter, some farther connexion between the cause and effect; and a connexion that has not place in the voluntary actions of intelligent beings. Now whether it be so or not, can only appear upon examination; and it is incumbent on these philosophers to make good their assertion, by defining or describing that necessity, and pointing it out to us in the operations of material causes.
      <br>&emsp;It would seem, indeed, that men begin at the wrong end of this question concerning liberty and necessity, when they enter upon it by examining the faculties of the soul, the influence of the understanding, and the operations of the will. Let them first discuss a more simple question, namely, the operations of body and of brute unintelligent matter; and try whether they can there form any idea of causation and necessity, except that of a constant conjunction of objects, and subsequent inference of the mind from one to another. If these circumstances form, in reality, the whole of that necessity, which we conceive in matter, and if these circumstances be also universally acknowledged to take place in the operations of the mind, the dispute is at an end; at least, must be owned to be thenceforth merely verbal. But as long as we will rashly suppose, that we have some farther idea of necessity and causation in the operations of external objects; at the same time, that we can find nothing farther, in the voluntary actions of the mind; there is no possibility of bringing the question to any determinate issue, while we proceed upon so erroneous a supposition. The only method of undeceiving us, is, to mount up higher; to examine the narrow extent of science when applied to material causes; and to convince ourselves, that all we know of them, is, the constant conjunction and inference above mentioned. We may, perhaps, find, that it is with difficulty we are induced to fix such narrow limits to human understanding: But we can afterwards find no difficulty when we come to apply this doctrine to the actions of the will. For as it is evident, that these have a regular conjunction with motives and circumstances and characters, and as we always draw inferences from one to the other, we must be obliged to acknowledge in words, that necessity, which we have already avowed, in every deliberation of our lives, and in every step of our conduct and behaviour.
      <br>&emsp;But to proceed in this reconciling project with regard to the question of liberty and necessity; the most contentious question, of metaphysics, the most contentious science; it will not require many words to prove, that all mankind have ever agreed in the doctrine of liberty as well as in that of necessity, and that the whole dispute, in this respect also, has been hitherto merely verbal. For what is meant by liberty, when applied to voluntary actions? We cannot surely mean, that actions have so little connexion with motives, inclinations, and circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of uniformity from the other, and that one affords no inference by which we can conclude the existence of the other. For these are plain and acknowledged matters of fact. By liberty, then, we can only mean a power of acting or not acting, according to the determinations of the will; that is, if we chuse to remain at rest, we may; if we chuse to move, we also may. Now this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one, who is not a prisoner and in chains. Here then is no subject of dispute.
      <br>&emsp;Whatever definition we may give of liberty, we should be careful to observe two requisite circumstances; first, that it be consistent with plain matter of fact; secondly, that it be consistent with itself. If we observe these circumstances, and render our definition intelligible, I am persuaded that all mankind will be found of one opinion with regard to it.
      <br>&emsp;It is universally allowed, that nothing exists without a cause of its existence, and that chance, when strictly examined, is a mere negative word, and means not any real power, which has any where, a being in nature. But it is pretended, that some causes are necessary, some not necessary. Here then is the advantage of definitions. Let any one define a cause, without comprehending, as a part of the definition, a necessary connexion with its effect; and let him shew distinctly the origin of the idea, expressed by the definition; and I shall readily give up the whole controversy. But if the foregoing explication of the matter be received, this must be absolutely impracticable. Had not objects a regular conjunction with each other, we should never have entertained any notion of cause and effect; and this regular conjunction produces that inference of the understanding, which is the only connexion, that we can have any comprehension of. Whoever attempts a definition of cause, exclusive of these circumstances, will be obliged, either to employ unintelligible terms, or such as are synonimous to the term, which he endeavours to define. And if the definition above mentioned be admitted; liberty, when opposed to necessity, not to constraint, is the same thing with chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence.
      <br>&emsp;Part Ii.
      <br>&emsp;There is no method of reasoning more common, and yet none more blameable, than, in philosophical disputes, to endeavour the refutation of any hypothesis, by a pretence of its dangerous consequences to religion and morality. When any opinion leads to absurdities, it is certainly false; but it is not certain that an opinion is false, because it is of dangerous consequence. Such topics, therefore, ought entirely to be forborne; as serving nothing to the discovery of truth, but only to make the person of an antagonist odious. This I observe in general, without pretending to draw any advantage from it. I frankly submit to an examination of this kind, and shall venture to affirm, that the doctrines, both of necessity and of liberty, as above explained, are not only consistent with morality, but are absolutely essential to its support.
      <br>&emsp;Necessity may be defined two ways, conformably to the two definitions of cause, of which it makes an essential part. It consists either in the constant conjunction of like objects, or in the inference of the understanding from one object to another. Now necessity, in both these senses, (which, indeed, are, at bottom, the same) has universally, though tacitly, in the schools, in the pulpit, and in common life, been allowed to belong to the will of man; and no one has ever pretended to deny, that we can draw inferences concerning human actions, and that those inferences are founded on the experienced union of like actions, with like motives, inclinations, and circumstances. The only particular, in which any one can differ, is, that either, perhaps, he will refuse to give the name of necessity to this property of human actions: But as long as the meaning is understood, I hope the word can do no harm: Or that he will maintain it possible to discover something farther in the operations of matter. But this, it must be acknowledged, can be of no consequence to morality or religion, whatever it may be to natural philosophy or metaphysics. We may here be mistaken in asserting, that there is no idea of any other necessity or connexion in the actions of body: But surely we ascribe nothing to the actions of the mind, but what every one does, and must readily allow of. We change no circumstance in the received orthodox system with regard to the will, but only in that with regard to material objects and causes. Nothing therefore can be more innocent, at least, than this doctrine.
      <br>&emsp;All laws being founded on rewards and punishments, it is supposed as a fundamental principle, that these motives have a regular and uniform influence on the mind, and both produce the good and prevent the evil actions. We may give to this influence what name we please; but, as it is usually conjoined with the action, it must be esteemed a cause, and be looked upon as an instance of that necessity, which we would here establish.
      <br>&emsp;The only proper object of hatred or vengeance, is a person or creature, endowed with thought and consciousness; and when any criminal or injurious actions excite that passion, it is only by their relation to the person, or connexion with him. Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where they proceed not from some cause in the character and disposition of the person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if good; nor infamy, if evil. The actions themselves may be blameable; they may be contrary to all the rules of morality and religion: But the person is not answerable for them; and as they proceeded from nothing in him, that is durable and constant, and leave nothing of that nature behind them, it is impossible he can, upon their account, become the object of punishment or vengeance. According to the principle, therefore, which denies necessity, and consequently causes, a man is as pure and untainted, after having committed the most horrid crime, as at the first moment of his birth, nor is his character any wise concerned in his actions; since they are not derived from it, and the wickedness of the one can never be used as a proof of the depravity of the other.
      <br>&emsp;Men are not blamed for such actions, as they perform ignorantly and casually, whatever may be the consequences. Why? but because the principles of these actions are only momentary, and terminate in them alone. Men are less blamed for such actions as they perform hastily and unpremeditately, than for such as proceed from deliberation. For what reason? but because a hasty temper, though a constant cause or principle in the mind, operates only by intervals, and infects not the whole character. Again, repentance wipes off every crime, if attended with a reformation of life and manners. How is this to be accounted for? but by asserting, that actions render a person criminal, merely as they are proofs of criminal principles in the mind; and when, by an alteration of these principles, they cease to be just proofs, they likewise cease to be criminal. But, except upon the doctrine of necessity, they never were just proofs, and consequently never were criminal.
      <br>&emsp;It will be equally easy to prove, and from the same arguments, that liberty, according to that definition above mentioned, in which all men agree, is also essential to morality, and that no human actions, where it is wanting, are susceptible of any moral qualities, or can be the objects either of approbation or dislike. For as actions are objects of our moral sentiment, so far only as they are indications of the internal character, passions, and affections; it is impossible that they can give rise either to praise or blame, where they proceed not from these principles, but are derived altogether from external violence.
      <br>&emsp;I pretend not to have obviated or removed all objections to this theory, with regard to necessity and liberty. I can foresee other objections, derived from topics, which have not here been treated of. It may be said, for instance, that, if voluntary actions be subjected to the same laws of necessity with the operations of matter, there is a continued chain of necessary causes, pre-ordained and pre-determined, reaching from the original cause of all, to every single volition of every human creature. No contingency any where in the universe; no indifference; no liberty. While we act, we are, at the same time, acted upon. The ultimate Author of all our volitions is the Creator of the world, who first bestowed motion on this immense machine, and placed all beings in that particular position, whence every subsequent event, by an inevitable necessity, must result. Human actions, therefore, either can have no moral turpitude at all, as proceeding from so good a cause; or if they have any turpitude, they must involve our Creator in the same guilt, while he is acknowledged to be their ultimate cause and author. For as a man, who fired a mine, is answerable for all the consequences whether the train he employed be long or short; so wherever a continued chain of necessary causes is fixed, that Being, either finite or infinite, who produces the first, is likewise the author of all the rest, and must both bear the blame and acquire the praise, which belong to them. Our clear and unalterable ideas of morality establish this rule, upon unquestionable reasons, when we examine the consequences of any human action; and these reasons must still have greater force, when applied to the volitions and intentions of a Being, infinitely wise and powerful. Ignorance or impotence may be pleaded for so limited a creature as man; but those imperfections have no place in our Creator. He foresaw, he ordained, he intended all those actions of men, which we so rashly pronounce criminal. And we must therefore conclude, either that they are not criminal, or that the Deity, not man, is accountable for them. But as either of these positions is absurd and impious, it follows, that the doctrine, from which they are deduced, cannot possibly be true, as being liable to all the same objections. An absurd consequence, if necessary, proves the original doctrine to be absurd; in the same manner as criminal actions render criminal the original cause, if the connexion between them be necessary and inevitable.
      <br>&emsp;This objection consists of two parts, which we shall examine separately; First, that, if human actions can be traced up, by a necessary chain, to the Deity, they can never be criminal; on account of the infinite perfection of that Being, from whom they are derived, and who can intend nothing but what is altogether good and laudable. Or, Secondly, if they be criminal, we must retract the attribute of perfection, which we ascribe to the Deity, and must acknowledge him to be the ultimate author of guilt and moral turpitude in all his creatures.
      <br>&emsp;The answer to the first objection seems obvious and convincing. There are many philosophers, who, after an exact scrutiny of all the phænomena of nature, conclude, that the Whole, considered as one system, is, in every period of its existence, ordered with perfect benevolence; and that the utmost possible happiness will, in the end, result to all created beings, without any mixture of positive or absolute ill and misery. Every physical ill, say they, makes an essential part of this benevolent system, and could not possibly be removed, even by the Deity himself, considered as a wise agent, without giving entrance to greater ill, or excluding greater good, which will result from it. From this theory, some philosophers, and the ancient Stoics among the rest, derived a topic of consolation under all afflictions, while they taught their pupils, that those ills, under which they laboured, were, in reality, goods to the universe; and that to an enlarged view, which could comprehend the whole system of nature, every event became an object of joy and exultation. But though this topic be specious and sublime, it was soon found in practice weak and ineffectual. You would surely more irritate, than appease a man, lying under the racking pains of the gout, by preaching up to him the rectitude of those general laws, which produced the malignant humours in his body, and led them through the proper canals, to the sinews and nerves, where they now excite such acute torments. These enlarged views may, for a moment, please the imagination of a speculative man, who is placed in ease and security; but neither can they dwell with constancy on his mind, even though undisturbed by the emotions of pain or passion; much less can they maintain their ground, when attacked by such powerful antagonists. The affections take a narrower and more natural survey of their object; and by an œconomy, more suitable to the infirmity of human minds, regard alone the beings around us, and are actuated by such events as appear good or ill to the private system.
      <br>&emsp;The case is the same with moral as with physical ill. It cannot reasonably be supposed, that those remote considerations, which are found of so little efficacy with regard to one, will have a more powerful influence with regard to the other. The mind of man is so formed by nature, that, upon the appearance of certain characters, dispositions, and actions, it immediately feels the sentiment of approbation or blame; nor are there any emotions more essential to its frame and constitution. The characters, which engage our approbation, are chiefly such as contribute to the peace and security of human society; as the characters, which excite blame, are chiefly such as tend to public detriment and disturbance: Whence it may reasonably be presumed, that the moral sentiments arise, either mediately or immediately, from a reflection on these opposite interests. What though philosophical meditations establish a different opinion or conjecture; that every thing is right with regard to the Whole, and that the qualities, which disturb society, are, in the main, as beneficial, and are as suitable to the primary intention of nature, as those which more directly promote its happiness and welfare? Are such remote and uncertain speculations able to counterbalance the sentiments, which arise from the natural and immediate view of the objects? A man who is robbed of a considerable sum; does he find his vexation for the loss any wise diminished by these sublime reflections? Why then should his moral resentment against the crime be supposed incompatible with them? Or why should not the acknowledgment of a real distinction between vice and virtue be reconcileable to all speculative systems of philosophy, as well as that of a real distinction between personal beauty and deformity? Both these distinctions are founded in the natural sentiments of the human mind: And these sentiments are not to be controuled or altered by any philosophical theory or speculation whatsoever.
      <br>&emsp;The second objection admits not of so easy and satisfactory an answer; nor is it possible to explain distinctly, how the Deity can be the mediate cause of all the actions of men, without being the author of sin and moral turpitude. These are mysteries, which mere natural and unassisted reason is very unfit to handle; and whatever system she embraces, she must find herself involved in inextricable difficulties, and even contradictions, at every step which she takes with regard to such subjects. To reconcile the indifference and contingency of human actions with prescience; or to defend absolute decrees, and yet free the Deity from being the author of sin, has been found hitherto to exceed all the power of philosophy. Happy, if she be thence sensible of her temerity, when she pries into these sublime mysteries; and leaving a scene so full of obscurities and perplexities, return, with suitable modesty, to her true and proper province, the examination of common life; where she will find difficulties enow to employ her enquiries, without launching into so boundless an ocean of doubt, uncertainty, and contradiction!

   <div class="content-text hidden"id="scepticismreason">
      In all demonstrative sciences the rules are certain and infallible; but when we apply them, our fallible and uncertain faculties are very apt to depart from them, and fall into error. We must, therefore, in every reasoning form a new judgment, as a check or controul on our first judgment or belief; and must enlarge our view to comprehend a kind of history of all the instances, wherein our understanding has deceiv'd us, compar'd with those, wherein its testimony was just and true. Our reason must be consider'd as a kind of cause, of which truth is the natural effect; but such-a-one as by the irruption of other causes, and by the inconstancy of our mental powers, may frequently be prevented. By this means all knowledge degenerates into probability; and this probability is greater or less, according to our experience of the veracity or deceitfulness of our understanding, and according to the simplicity or intricacy of the question.
      <br>&emsp;There is no Algebraist nor Mathematician so expert in his science, as to place entire confidence in any truth immediately upon his discovery of it, or regard it as any thing, but a mere probability. Every time he runs over his proofs, his confidence encreases; but still more by the approbation of his friends; and is rais'd to its utmost perfection by the universal assent and applauses of the learned world. Now 'tis evident, that this gradual encrease of assurance is nothing but the addition of new probabilities, and is deriv'd from the constant union of causes and effects, according to past experience and observation.
      <br>&emsp;In accompts of any length or importance, Merchants seldom trust to the infallible certainty of numbers for their security; but by the artificial structure of the accompts, produce a probability beyond what is deriv'd from the skill and experience of the accomptant. For that is plainly of itself some degree of probability; tho' uncertain and variable, according to the degrees of his experience and length of the accompt. Now as none will maintain, that our assurance in a long numeration exceeds probability, I may safely affirm, that there scarce is any proposition concerning numbers, of which we can have a fuller security. For 'tis easily possible, by gradually diminishing the numbers, to reduce the longest series of addition to the most simple question, which can be form'd, to an addition of two single numbers; and upon this supposition we shall find it impracticable to shew the precise limits of knowledge and of probability, or discover that particular number, at which the one ends and the other begins. But knowledge and probability are of such contrary and disagreeing natures, that they cannot well run insensibly into each other, and that because they will not divide, but must be either entirely present, or entirely absent. Besides, if any single addition were certain, every one wou'd be so, and consequently the whole or total sum; unless the whole can be different from all its parts. I had almost said, that this was certain; but I reflect, that it must reduce itself, as well as every other reasoning, and from knowledge degenerate into probability.
      <br>&emsp;Since therefore all knowledge resolves itself into probability, and becomes at last of the same nature with that evidence, which we employ in common life, we must now examine this latter species of reasoning, and see on what foundation it stands.
      <br>&emsp;In every judgment, which we can form concerning probability, as well as concerning knowledge, we ought always to correct the first judgment, deriv'd from the nature of the object, by another judgment, deriv'd from the nature of the understanding. 'Tis certain a man of solid sense and long experience ought to have, and usually has, a greater assurance in his opinions, than one that is foolish and ignorant, and that our sentiments have different degrees of authority, even with ourselves, in proportion to the degrees of our reason and experience. In the man of the best sense and longest experience, this authority is never entire; since even such-a-one must be conscious of many errors in the past, and must still dread the like for the future. Here then arises a new species of probability to correct and regulate the first, and fix its just standard and proportion. As demonstration is subject to the controul of probability, so is probability liable to a new correction by a reflex act of the mind, wherein the nature of our understanding, and our reasoning from the first probability become our objects.
      <br>&emsp;Having thus found in every probability, beside the original uncertainty inherent in the subject, a new uncertainty deriv'd from the weakness of that faculty, which judges, and having adjusted these two together, we are oblig'd by our reason to add a new doubt deriv'd from the possibility of error in the estimation we make of the truth and fidelity of our faculties. This is a doubt, which immediately occurs to us, and of which, if we wou'd closely pursue our reason, we cannot avoid giving a decision. But this decision, tho' it shou'd be favourable to our preceeding judgment, being founded only on probability, must weaken still further our first evidence, and must itself be weaken'd by a fourth doubt of the same kind, and so on in infinitum; till at last there remain nothing of the original probability, however great we may suppose it to have been, and however small the diminution by every new uncertainty. No finite object can subsist under a decrease repeated in infinitum; and even the vastest quantity, which can enter into human imagination, must in this manner be reduc'd to nothing. Let our first belief be never so strong, it must infallibly perish by passing thro' so many new examinations, of which each diminishes somewhat of its force and vigour. When I reflect on the natural fallibility of my judgment, I have less confidence in my opinions, than when I only consider the objects concerning which I reason; and when I proceed still farther, to turn the scrutiny against every successive estimation I make of my faculties, all the rules of logic require a continual diminution, and at last a total extinction of belief and evidence.
      <br>&emsp;Shou'd it here be ask'd me, whether I sincerely assent to this argument, which I seem to take such pains to inculcate, and whether I be really one of those sceptics, who hold that all is uncertain, and that our judgment is not in any thing possest of any measures of truth and falshood; I shou'd reply, that this question is entirely superfluous, and that neither I, nor any other person was ever sincerely and constantly of that opinion. Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and feel; nor can we any more forbear viewing certain objects in a stronger and fuller light, upon account of their customary connexion with a present impression, than we can hinder ourselves from thinking as long as we are awake, or seeing the surrounding bodies, when we turn our eyes towards them in broad sunshine. Whoever has taken the pains to refute the cavils of this total scepticism, has really disputed without an antagonist, and endeavour'd by arguments to establish a faculty, which nature has antecedently implanted in the mind, and render'd unavoidable.
      <br>&emsp;My intention then in displaying so carefully the arguments of that fantastic sect, is only to make the reader sensible of the truth of my hypothesis, that all our reasonings concerning causes and effects are deriv'd from nothing but custom; and that belief is more properly an act of the sensitive, than of the cogitative part of our natures. I have here prov'd, that the very same principles, which make us form a decision upon any subject, and correct that decision by the consideration of our genius and capacity, and of the situation of our mind, when we examin'd that subject; I say, I have prov'd, that these same principles, when carry'd farther, and apply'd to every new reflex judgment, must, by continually diminishing the original evidence, at last reduce it to nothing, and utterly subvert all belief and opinion. If belief, therefore, were a simple act of the thought, without any peculiar manner of conception, or the addition of a force and vivacity, it must infallibly destroy itself, and in every case terminate in a total suspense of judgment. But as experience will sufficiently convince any one, who thinks it worth while to try, that tho' he can find no error in the foregoing arguments, yet he still continues to believe, and think, and reason as usual, he may safely conclude, that his reasoning and belief is some sensation or peculiar manner of conception, which 'tis impossible for mere ideas and reflections to destroy.
      <br>&emsp;But here, perhaps, it may be demanded, how it happens, even upon my hypothesis, that these arguments above-explain'd produce not a total suspense of judgment, and after what manner the mind ever retains a degree of assurance in any subject? For as these new probabilities, which by their repetition perpetually diminish the original evidence, are founded on the very same principles, whether of thought or sensation, as the primary judgment, it may seem unavoidable, that in either case they must equally subvert it, and by the opposition, either of contrary thoughts or sensations, reduce the mind to a total uncertainty. I suppose, there is some question propos'd to me, and that after revolving over the impressions of my memory and senses, and carrying my thoughts from them to such objects, as are commonly conjoin'd with them, I feel a stronger and more forcible conception on the one side, than on the other. This strong conception forms my first decision. I suppose, that afterwards I examine my judgment itself, and observing from experience, that 'tis sometimes just and sometimes erroneous, I consider it as regulated by contrary principles or causes, of which some lead to truth, and some to error; and in ballancing these contrary causes, I diminish by a new probability the assurance of my first decision. This new probability is liable to the same diminution as the foregoing, and so on, in infinitum. 'Tis therefore demanded, how it happens, that even after all we retain a degree of belief, which is sufficient for our purpose, either in philosophy or common life.
      <br>&emsp;I answer, that after the first and second decision; as the action of the mind becomes forc'd and unnatural, and the ideas faint and obscure; tho' the principles of judgment, and the ballancing of opposite causes be the same as at the very beginning; yet their influence on the imagination, and the vigour they add to, or diminish from the thought, is by no means equal. Where the mind reaches not its objects with easiness and facility, the same principles have not the same effect as in a more natural conception of the ideas; nor does the imagination feel a sensation, which holds any proportion with that which arises from its common judgments and opinions. The attention is on the stretch: The posture of the mind is uneasy; and the spirits being diverted from their natural course, are not govern'd in their movements by the same laws, at least not to the same degree, as when they flow in their usual channel.
      <br>&emsp;If we desire similar instances, 'twill not be very difficult to find them. The present subject of metaphysics will supply us abundantly. The same argument, which wou'd have been esteem'd convincing in a reasoning concerning history or politics, has little or no influence in these abstruser subjects, even tho' it be perfectly comprehended; and that because there is requir'd a study and an effort of thought, in order to its being comprehended: And this effort of thought disturbs the operation of our sentiments, on which the belief depends. The case is the same in other subjects. The straining of the imagination always hinders the regular flowing of the passions and sentiments. A tragic poet, that wou'd represent his heroes as very ingenious and witty in their misfortunes, wou'd never touch the passions. As the emotions of the soul prevent any subtile reasoning and reflection, so these latter actions of the mind are equally prejudicial to the former. The mind, as well as the body, seems to be endow'd with a certain precise degree of force and activity, which it never employs in one action, but at the expence of all the rest. This is more evidently true, where the actions are of quite different natures; since in that case the force of the mind is not only diverted, but even the disposition chang'd, so as to render us incapable of a sudden transition from one action to the other, and still more of performing both at once. No wonder, then, the conviction, which arises from a subtile reasoning, diminishes in proportion to the efforts, which the imagination makes to enter into the reasoning, and to conceive it in all its parts. Belief, being a lively conception, can never be entire, where it is not founded on something natural and easy.
      <br>&emsp;This I take to be the true state of the question, and cannot approve of that expeditious way, which some take with the sceptics, to reject at once all their arguments without enquiry or examination. If the sceptical reasonings be strong, say they, 'tis a proof, that reason may have some force and authority: if weak, they can never be sufficient to invalidate all the conclusions of our understanding. This argument is not just; because the sceptical reasonings, were it possible for them to exist, and were they not destroy'd by their subtility, wou'd be successively both strong and weak, according to the successive dispositions of the mind. Reason first appears in possession of the throne, prescribing laws, and imposing maxims, with an absolute sway and authority. Her enemy, therefore, is oblig'd to take shelter under her protection, and by making use of rational arguments to prove the fallaciousness and imbecility of reason, produces, in a manner, a patent under her hand and seal. This patent has at first an authority, proportion'd to the present and immediate authority of reason, from which it is deriv'd. But as it is suppos'd to be contradictory to reason, it gradually diminishes the force of that governing power, and its own at the same time; till at last they both vanish away into nothing, by a regular and just diminution. The sceptical and dogmatical reasons are of the same kind, tho' contrary in their operation and tendency; so that where the latter is strong, it has an enemy of equal force in the former to encounter; and as their forces were at first equal, they still continue so, as long as either of them subsists; nor does one of them lose any force in the contest, without taking as much from its antagonist. 'Tis happy, therefore, that nature breaks the force of all sceptical arguments in time, and keeps them from having any considerable influence on the understanding. Were we to trust entirely to their self-destruction, that can never take place, 'till they have first subverted all conviction, and have totally destroy'd human reason.
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="scepticismsenses">
      Thus the sceptic still continues to reason and believe, even tho' he asserts, that he cannot defend his reason by reason; and by the same rule he must assent to the principle concerning the existence of body, tho' he cannot pretend by any arguments of philosophy to maintain its veracity. Nature has not left this to his choice, and has doubtless esteem'd it an affair of too great importance to be trusted to our uncertain reasonings and speculations. We may well ask, What causes induce us to believe in the existence of body? but 'tis in vain to ask, Whether there be body or not? That is a point, which we must take for granted in all our reasonings.
      <br>&emsp;The subject, then, of our present enquiry is concerning the causes which induce us to believe in the existence of body: And my reasonings on this head I shall begin with a distinction, which at first sight may seem superfluous, but which will contribute very much to the perfect understanding of what follows. We ought to examine apart those two questions, which are commonly confounded together, viz. Why we attribute a continu'd existence to objects, even when they are not present to the senses; and why we suppose them to have an existence distinct from the mind and perception. Under this last head I comprehend their situation as well as relations, their external position as well as the independence of their existence and operation. These two questions concerning the continu'd and distinct existence of body are intimately connected together. For if the objects of our senses continue to exist, even when they are not perceiv'd, their existence is of course independent of and distinct from the perception; and vice versa, if their existence be independent of the perception and distinct from it, they must continue to exist, even tho' they be not perceiv'd. But tho' the decision of the one question decides the other; yet that we may the more easily discover the principles of human nature, from whence the decision arises, we shall carry along with us this distinction, and shall consider, whether it be the senses, reason, or the imagination, that produces the opinion of a continu'd or of a distinct existence. These are the only questions, that are intelligible on the present subject. For as to the notion of external existence, when taken for something specifically different from our perceptions, we have already shewn its absurdity.
      <br>&emsp;To begin with the senses, 'tis evident these faculties are incapable of giving rise to the notion of the continu'd existence of their objects, after they no longer appear to the senses. For that is a contradiction in terms, and supposes that the senses continue to operate, even after they have ceas'd all manner of operation. These faculties, therefore, if they have any influence in the present case, must produce the opinion of a distinct, not of a continu'd existence; and in order to that, must present their impressions either as images and representations, or as these very distinct and external existences.
      <br>&emsp;That our senses offer not their impressions as the images of something distinct, or independent, and external, is evident; because they convey to us nothing but a single perception, and never give us the least intimation of any thing beyond. A single perception can never produce the idea of a double existence, but by some inference either of the reason or imagination. When the mind looks farther than what immediately appears to it, its conclusions can never be put to the account of the senses; and it certainly looks farther, when from a single perception it infers a double existence, and supposes the relations of resemblance and causation betwixt them.
      <br>&emsp;If our senses, therefore, suggest any idea of distinct existences, they must convey the impressions as those very existences, by a kind of fallacy and illusion. Upon this head we may observe, that all sensations are felt by the mind, such as they really are, and that when we doubt, whether they present themselves as distinct objects, or as mere impressions, the difficulty is not concerning their nature, but concerning their relations and situation. Now if the senses presented our impressions as external to, and independent of ourselves, both the objects and ourselves must be obvious to our senses, otherwise they cou'd not be compar'd by these faculties. The difficulty, then, is how far we are ourselves the object of our senses.
      <br>&emsp;'Tis certain there is no question in philosophy more abstruse than that concerning identity, and the nature of the uniting principle, which constitutes a person. So far from being able by our senses merely to determine this question, we must have recourse to the most profound metaphysics to give a satisfactory answer to it; and in common life 'tis evident these ideas of self and person are never very fix'd nor determinate. 'Tis absurd, therefore, to imagine the senses can ever distinguish betwixt ourselves and external objects.
      <br>&emsp;Add to this, that every impression, external and internal, passions, affections, sensations, pains and pleasures, are originally on the same footing; and that whatever other differences we may observe among them, they appear, all of them, in their true colours, as impressions or perceptions. And indeed, if we consider the matter aright, 'tis scarce possible it shou'd be otherwise, nor is it conceivable that our senses shou'd be more capable of deceiving us in the situation and relations, than in the nature of our impressions. For since all actions and sensations of the mind are known to us by consciousness, they must necessarily appear in every particular what they are, and be what they appear. Every thing that enters the mind, being in reality a perception, 'tis impossible any thing shou'd to feeling appear different. This were to suppose, that even where we are most intimately conscious, we might be mistaken.
      <br>&emsp;But not to lose time in examining, whether 'tis possible for our senses to deceive us, and represent our perceptions as distinct from ourselves, that is as external to and independent of us; let us consider whether they really do so, and whether this error proceeds from an immediate sensation, or from some other causes.
      <br>&emsp;To begin with the question concerning external existence, it may perhaps be said, that setting aside the metaphysical question of the identity of a thinking substance, our own body evidently belongs to us; and as several impressions appear exterior to the body, we suppose them also exterior to ourselves. The paper, on which I write at present, is beyond my hand. The table is beyond the paper. The walls of the chamber beyond the table. And in casting my eye towards the window, I perceive a great extent of fields and buildings beyond my chamber. From all this it may be infer'd, that no other faculty is requir'd, beside the senses, to convince us of the external existence of body. But to prevent this inference, we need only weigh the three following considerations. First, That, properly speaking, 'tis not our body we perceive, when we regard our limbs and members, but certain impressions, which enter by the senses; so that the ascribing a real and corporeal existence to these impressions, or to their objects, is an act of the mind as difficult to explain, as that which we examine at present. Secondly, Sounds, and tastes, and smells, tho' commonly regarded by the mind as continu'd independent qualities, appear not to have any existence in extension, and consequently cannot appear to the senses as situated externally to the body. The reason, why we ascribe a place to them, shall be consider'd afterwards. Thirdly, Even our sight informs us not of distance or outness (so to speak) immediately and without a certain reasoning and experience, as is acknowledg'd by the most rational philosophers.
      <br>&emsp;As to the independency of our perceptions on ourselves, this can never be an object of the senses; but any opinion we form concerning it, must be deriv'd from experience and observation: And we shall see afterwards, that our conclusions from experience are far from being favourable to the doctrine of the independency of our perceptions. Mean while we may observe that when we talk of real distinct existences, we have commonly more in our eye their independency than external situation in place, and think an object has a sufficient reality, when its Being is uninterrupted, and independent of the incessant revolutions, which we are conscious of in ourselves.
      <br>&emsp;Thus to resume what I have said concerning the senses; they give us no notion of continu'd existence, because they cannot operate beyond the extent, in which they really operate. They as little produce the opinion of a distinct existence, because they neither can offer it to the mind as represented, nor as original. To offer it as represented, they must present both an object and an image. To make it appear as original, they must convey a falshood; and this falshood must lie in the relations and situation: In order to which they must be able to compare the object with ourselves; and even in that case they do not, nor is it possible they shou'd, deceive us. We may, therefore, conclude with certainty, that the opinion of a continu'd and of a distinct existence never arises from the senses.
      <br>&emsp;To confirm this we may observe, that there are three different kinds of impressions convey'd by the senses. The first are those of the figure, bulk, motion and solidity of bodies. The second those of colours, tastes, smells, sounds, heat and cold. The third are the pains and pleasures, that arise from the application of objects to our bodies, as by the cutting of our flesh with steel, and such like. Both philosophers and the vulgar suppose the first of these to have a distinct continu'd existence. The vulgar only regard the second as on the same footing. Both philosophers and the vulgar, again, esteem the third to be merely perceptions; and consequently interrupted and dependent beings.
      <br>&emsp;Now 'tis evident, that, whatever may be our philosophical opinion, colours, sounds, heat and cold, as far as appears to the senses, exist after the same manner with motion and solidity, and that the difference we make betwixt them in this respect, arises not from the mere perception. So strong is the prejudice for the distinct continu'd existence of the former qualities, that when the contrary opinion is advanc'd by modern philosophers, people imagine they can almost refute it from their feeling and experience, and that their very senses contradict this philosophy. 'Tis also evident, that colours, sounds, &c. are originally on the same footing with the pain that arises from steel, and pleasure that proceeds from a fire; and that the difference betwixt them is founded neither on perception nor reason, but on the imagination. For as they are confest to be, both of them, nothing but perceptions arising from the particular configurations and motions of the parts of body, wherein possibly can their difference consist? Upon the whole, then, we may conclude, that as far as the senses are judges, all perceptions are the same in the manner of their existence.
      <br>&emsp;We may also observe in this instance of sounds and colours, that we can attribute a distinct continu'd existence to objects without ever consulting reason, or weighing our opinions by any philosophical principles. And indeed, whatever convincing arguments philosophers may fancy they can produce to establish the belief of objects independent of the mind, 'tis obvious these arguments are known but to very few, and that 'tis not by them, that children, peasants, and the greatest part of mankind are induc'd to attribute objects to some impressions, and deny them to others. Accordingly we find, that all the conclusions, which the vulgar form on this head, are directly contrary to those, which are confirm'd by philosophy. For philosophy informs us, that every thing, which appears to the mind, is nothing but a perception, and is interrupted, and dependent on the mind; whereas the vulgar confound perceptions and objects, and attribute a distinct continu'd existence to the very things they feel or see. This sentiment, then, as it is entirely unreasonable, must proceed from some other faculty than the understanding. To which we may add, that as long as we take our perceptions and objects to be the same, we can never infer the existence of the one from that of the other, nor form any argument from the relation of cause and effect; which is the only one that can assure us of matter of fact. Even after we distinguish our perceptions from our objects, 'twill appear presently, that we are still incapable of reasoning from the existence of one to that of the other: So that upon the whole our reason neither does, nor is it possible it ever shou'd, upon any supposition, give us an assurance of the continu'd and distinct existence of body. That opinion must be entirely owing to the imagination: which must now be the subject of our enquiry.
      <br>&emsp;Since all impressions are internal and perishing existences, and appear as such, the notion of their distinct and continu'd existence must arise from a concurrence of some of their qualities with the qualities of the imagination; and since this notion does not extend to all of them, it must arise from certain qualities peculiar to some impressions. 'Twill therefore be easy for us to discover these qualities by a comparison of the impressions, to which we attribute a distinct and continu'd existence, with those, which we regard as internal and perishing.
      <br>&emsp;We may observe, then, that 'tis neither upon account of the involuntariness of certain impressions, as is commonly suppos'd, nor of their superior force and violence, that we attribute to them a reality, and continu'd existence, which we refuse to others, that are voluntary or feeble. For 'tis evident our pains and pleasures, our passions and affections, which we never suppose to have any existence beyond our perception, operate with greater violence, and are equally involuntary, as the impressions of figure and extension, colour and sound, which we suppose to be permanent beings. The heat of a fire, when moderate, is suppos'd to exist in the fire; but the pain, which it causes upon a near approach, is not taken to have any being except in the perception.
      <br>&emsp;These vulgar opinions, then, being rejected, we must search for some other hypothesis, by which we may discover those peculiar qualities in our impressions, which makes us attribute to them a distinct and continu'd existence.
      <br>&emsp;After a little examination, we shall find, that all those objects, to which we attribute a continu'd existence, have a peculiar constancy, which distinguishes them from the impressions, whose existence depends upon our perception. Those mountains, and houses, and trees, which lie at present under my eye, have always appear'd to me in the same order; and when I lose sight of them by shutting my eyes or turning my head, I soon after find them return upon me without the least alteration. My bed and table, my books and papers, present themselves in the same uniform manner, and change not upon account of any interruption in my seeing or perceiving them. This is the case with all the impressions, whose objects are suppos'd to have an external existence; and is the case with no other impressions, whether gentle or violent, voluntary or involuntary.
      <br>&emsp;This constancy, however, is not so perfect as not to admit of very considerable exceptions. Bodies often change their position and qualities, and after a little absence or interruption may become hardly knowable. But here 'tis observable, that even in these changes they preserve a coherence, and have a regular dependence on each other; which is the foundation of a kind of reasoning from causation, and produces the opinion of their continu'd existence. When I return to my chamber after an hour's absence, I find not my fire in the same situation, in which I left it: But then I am accustom'd in other instances to see a like alteration produc'd in a like time, whether I am present or absent, near or remote. This coherence, therefore, in their changes is one of the characteristics of external objects, as well as their constancy.
      <br>&emsp;Having found that the opinion of the continu'd existence of body depends on the coherence and constancy of certain impressions, I now proceed to examine after what manner these qualities give rise to so extraordinary an opinion. To begin with the coherence; we may observe, that tho' those internal impressions, which we regard as fleeting and perishing, have also a certain coherence or regularity in their appearances, yet 'tis of somewhat a different nature, from that which we discover in bodies. Our passions are found by experience to have a mutual connexion with and dependance on each other; but on no occasion is it necessary to suppose, that they have existed and operated, when they were not perceiv'd, in order to preserve the same dependance and connexion, of which we have had experience. The case is not the same with relation to external objects. Those require a continu'd existence, or otherwise lose, in a great measure, the regularity of their operation. I am here seated in my chamber with my face to the fire; and all the objects, that strike my senses, are contain'd in a few yards around me. My memory, indeed, informs me of the existence of many objects; but then this information extends not beyond their past existence, nor do either my senses or memory give any testimony to the continuance of their being. When therefore I am thus seated, and revolve over these thoughts, I hear on a sudden a noise as of a door turning upon its hinges; and a little after see a porter, who advances towards me. This gives occasion to many new reflections and reasonings. First, I never have observ'd, that this noise cou'd proceed from any thing but the motion of a door; and therefore conclude, that the present phænomenon is a contradiction to all past experience, unless the door, which I remember on t'other side the chamber, be still in being. Again, I have always found, that a human body was possest of a quality, which I call gravity, and which hinders it from mounting in the air, as this porter must have done to arrive at my chamber, unless the stairs I remember be not annihilated by my absence. But this is not all. I receive a letter, which upon opening it I perceive by the hand-writing and subscription to have come from a friend, who says he is two hundred leagues distant. 'Tis evident I can never account for this phænomenon, conformable to my experience in other instances, without spreading out in my mind the whole sea and continent between us, and supposing the effects and continu'd existence of posts and ferries, according to my memory and observation. To consider these phænomena of the porter and letter in a certain light, they are contradictions to common experience, and may be regarded as objections to those maxims, which we form concerning the connexions of causes and effects. I am accustom'd to hear such a sound, and see such an object in motion at the same time. I have not receiv'd in this particular instance both these perceptions. These observations are contrary, unless I suppose that the door still remains, and that it was open'd without my perceiving it: And this supposition, which was at first entirely arbitrary and hypothetical, acquires a force and evidence by its being the only one, upon which I can reconcile these contradictions. There is scarce a moment of my life, wherein there is not a similar instance presented to me, and I have not occasion to suppose the continu'd existence of objects, in order to connect their past and present appearances, and give them such an union with each other, as I have found by experience to be suitable to their particular natures and circumstances. Here then I am naturally led to regard the world, as something real and durable, and as preserving its existence, even when it is no longer present to my perception.
      <br>&emsp;But tho' this conclusion from the coherence of appearances may seem to be of the same nature with our reasonings concerning causes and effects; as being deriv'd from custom, and regulated by past experience; we shall find upon examination, that they are at the bottom considerably different from each other, and that this inference arises from the understanding, and from custom in an indirect and oblique manner. For 'twill readily be allow'd, that since nothing is ever really present to the mind, besides its own perceptions, 'tis not only impossible, that any habit shou'd ever be acquir'd otherwise than by the regular succession of these perceptions, but also that any habit shou'd ever exceed that degree of regularity. Any degree, therefore, of regularity in our perceptions, can never be a foundation for us to infer a greater degree of regularity in some objects, which are not perceiv'd; since this supposes a contradiction, viz. a habit acquir'd by what was never present to the mind. But 'tis evident, that whenever we infer the continu'd existence of the objects of sense from their coherence, and the frequency of their union, 'tis in order to bestow on the objects a greater regularity than what is observ'd in our mere perceptions. We remark a connexion betwixt two kinds of objects in their past appearance to the senses, but are not able to observe this connexion to be perfectly constant, since the turning about of our head, or the shutting of our eyes is able to break it. What then do we suppose in this case, but that these objects still continue their usual connexion, notwithstanding their apparent interruption, and that the irregular appearances are join'd by something, of which we are insensible? But as all reasoning concerning matters of fact arises only from custom, and custom can only be the effect of repeated perceptions, the extending of custom and reasoning beyond the perceptions can never be the direct and natural effect of the constant repetition and connexion, but must arise from the co-operation of some other principles.
      <br>&emsp;I have already observ'd, in examining the foundation of mathematics, that the imagination, when set into any train of thinking, is apt to continue, even when its object fails it, and like a galley put in motion by the oars, carries on its course without any new impulse. This I have assign'd for the reason, why, after considering several loose standards of equality, and correcting them by each other, we proceed to imagine so correct and exact a standard of that relation, as is not liable to the least error or variation. The same principle makes us easily entertain this opinion of the continu'd existence of body. Objects have a certain coherence even as they appear to our senses; but this coherence is much greater and more uniform, if we suppose the objects to have a continu'd existence; and as the mind is once in the train of observing an uniformity among objects, it naturally continues, till it renders the uniformity as compleat as possible. The simple supposition of their continu'd existence suffices for this purpose, and gives us a notion of a much greater regularity among objects, than what they have when we look no farther than our senses.
      <br>&emsp;But whatever force we may ascribe to this principle, I am afraid 'tis too weak to support alone so vast an edifice, as is that of the continu'd existence of all external bodies; and that we must join the constancy of their appearance to the coherence, in order to give a satisfactory account of that opinion. As the explication of this will lead me into a considerable compass of very profound reasoning; I think it proper, in order to avoid confusion, to give a short sketch or abridgment of my system, and afterwards draw out all its parts in their full compass. This inference from the constancy of our perceptions, like the precedent from their coherence, gives rise to the opinion of the continu'd existence of body, which is prior to that of its distinct existence, and produces that latter principle.
      <br>&emsp;When we have been accustom'd to observe a constancy in certain impressions, and have found, that the perception of the sun or ocean, for instance, returns upon us after an absence or annihilation with like parts and in a like order, as at its first appearance, we are not apt to regard these interrupted perceptions as different, (which they really are) but on the contrary consider them as individually the same, upon account of their resemblance. But as this interruption of their existence is contrary to their perfect identity, and makes us regard the first impression as annihilated, and the second as newly created, we find ourselves somewhat at a loss, and are involv'd in a kind of contradiction. In order to free ourselves from this difficulty, we disguise, as much as possible, the interruption, or rather remove it entirely, by supposing that these interrupted perceptions are connected by a real existence, of which we are insensible. This supposition, or idea of continu'd existence, acquires a force and vivacity from the memory of these broken impressions, and from that propensity, which they give us, to suppose them the same; and according to the precedent reasoning, the very essence of belief consists in the force and vivacity of the conception.
      <br>&emsp;In order to justify this system, there are four things requisite. First, To explain the principium individuationis, or principle of identity. Secondly, Give a reason, why the resemblance of our broken and interrupted perceptions induces us to attribute an identity to them. Thirdly, Account for that propensity, which this illusion gives, to unite these broken appearances by a continu'd existence. Fourthly and lastly, Explain that force and vivacity of conception, which arises from the propensity.
      <br>&emsp;First, As to the principle of individuation; we may observe, that the view of any one object is not sufficient to convey the idea of identity. For in that proposition, an object is the same with itself, if the idea express'd by the word, object, were no ways distinguish'd from that meant by itself; we really shou'd mean nothing, nor wou'd the proposition contain a predicate and a subject, which however are imply'd in this affirmation. One single object conveys the idea of unity, not that of identity.
      <br>&emsp;On the other hand, a multiplicity of objects can never convey this idea, however resembling they may be suppos'd. The mind always pronounces the one not to be the other, and considers them as forming two, three, or any determinate number of objects, whose existences are entirely distinct and independent.
      <br>&emsp;Since then both number and unity are incompatible with the relation of identity, it must lie in something that is neither of them. But to tell the truth, at first sight this seems utterly impossible. Betwixt unity and number there can be no medium; no more than betwixt existence and non-existence. After one object is suppos'd to exist, we must either suppose another also to exist; in which case we have the idea of number: Or we must suppose it not to exist; in which case the first object remains at unity.
      <br>&emsp;To remove this difficulty, let us have recourse to the idea of time or duration. I have already observ'd, that time, in a strict sense, implies succession, and that when we apply its idea to any unchangeable object, 'tis only by a fiction of the imagination, by which the unchangeable object is suppos'd to participate of the changes of the co-existent objects, and in particular of that of our perceptions. This fiction of the imagination almost universally takes place; and 'tis by means of it, that a single object, plac'd before us, and survey'd for any time without our discovering in it any interruption or variation, is able to give us a notion of identity. For when we consider any two points of this time, we may place them in different lights: We may either survey them at the very same instant; in which case they give us the idea of number, both by themselves and by the object; which must be multiply'd, in order to be conceiv'd at once, as existent in these two different points of time: Or on the other hand, we may trace the succession of time by a like succession of ideas, and conceiving first one moment, along with the object then existent, imagine afterwards a change in the time without any variation or interruption in the object; in which case it gives us the idea of unity. Here then is an idea, which is a medium betwixt unity and number; or more properly speaking, is either of them, according to the view, in which we take it: And this idea we call that of identity. We cannot, in any propriety of speech, say, that an object is the same with itself, unless we mean, that the object existent at one time is the same with itself existent at another. By this means we make a difference, betwixt the idea meant by the word, object, and that meant by itself, without going the length of number, and at the same time without restraining ourselves to a strict and absolute unity.
      <br>&emsp;Thus the principle of individuation is nothing but the invariableness and uninterruptedness of any object, thro' a suppos'd variation of time, by which the mind can trace it in the different periods of its existence, without any break of the view, and without being oblig'd to form the idea of multiplicity or number.
      <br>&emsp;I now proceed to explain the second part of my system, and shew why the constancy of our perceptions makes us ascribe to them a perfect numerical identity, tho' there be very long intervals betwixt their appearance, and they have only one of the essential qualities of identity, viz. invariableness. That I may avoid all ambiguity and confusion on this head, I shall observe, that I here account for the opinions and belief of the vulgar with regard to the existence of body; and therefore must entirely conform myself to their manner of thinking and of expressing themselves. Now we have already observ'd, that however philosophers may distinguish betwixt the objects and perceptions of the senses; which they suppose co-existent and resembling; yet this is a distinction, which is not comprehended by the generality of mankind, who as they perceive only one being, can never assent to the opinion of a double existence and representation. Those very sensations, which enter by the eye or ear, are with them the true objects, nor can they readily conceive that this pen or paper, which is immediately perceiv'd, represents another, which is different from, but resembling it. In order, therefore, to accommodate myself to their notions, I shall at first suppose; that there is only a single existence, which I shall call indifferently object or perception, according as it shall seem best to suit my purpose, understanding by both of them what any common man means by a hat, or shoe, or stone, or any other impression, convey'd to him by his senses. I shall be sure to give warning, when I return to a more philosophical way of speaking and thinking.
      <br>&emsp;To enter, therefore, upon the question concerning the source of the error and deception with regard to identity, when we attribute it to our resembling perceptions, notwithstanding their interruption; I must here recal an observation, which I have already prov'd and explain'd. Nothing is more apt to make us mistake one idea for another, than any relation betwixt them, which associates them together in the imagination, and makes it pass with facility from one to the other. Of all relations, that of resemblance is in this respect the most efficacious; and that because it not only causes an association of ideas, but also of dispositions, and makes us conceive the one idea by an act or operation of the mind, similar to that by which we conceive the other. This circumstance I have observ'd to be of great moment; and we may establish it for a general rule, that whatever ideas place the mind in the same disposition or in similar ones, are very apt to be confounded. The mind readily passes from one to the other, and perceives not the change without a strict attention, of which, generally speaking, 'tis wholly incapable.
      <br>&emsp;In order to apply this general maxim, we must first examine the disposition of the mind in viewing any object which preserves a perfect identity, and then find some other object, that is confounded with it, by causing a similar disposition. When we fix our thought on any object, and suppose it to continue the same for some time; 'tis evident we suppose the change to lie only in the time, and never exert ourselves to produce any new image or idea of the object. The faculties of the mind repose themselves in a manner, and take no more exercise, than what is necessary to continue that idea, of which we were formerly possest, and which subsists without variation or interruption. The passage from one moment to another is scarce felt, and distinguishes not itself by a different perception or idea, which may require a different direction of the spirits, in order to its conception.
      <br>&emsp;Now what other objects, beside identical ones, are capable of placing the mind in the same disposition, when it considers them, and of causing the same uninterrupted passage of the imagination from one idea to another? This question is of the last importance. For if we can find any such objects, we may certainly conclude, from the foregoing principle, that they are very naturally confounded with identical ones, and are taken for them in most of our reasonings. But tho' this question be very important, 'tis not very difficult nor doubtful. For I immediately reply, that a succession of related objects places the mind in this disposition, and is consider'd with the same smooth and uninterrupted progress of the imagination, as attends the view of the same invariable object. The very nature and essence of relation is to connect our ideas with each other, and upon the appearance of one, to facilitate the transition to its correlative. The passage betwixt related ideas is, therefore, so smooth and easy, that it produces little alteration on the mind, and seems like the continuation of the same action; and as the continuation of the same action is an effect of the continu'd view of the same object, 'tis for this reason we attribute sameness to every succession of related objects. The thought slides along the succession with equal facility, as if it consider'd only one object; and therefore confounds the succession with the identity.
      <br>&emsp;We shall afterwards see many instances of this tendency of relation to make us ascribe an identity to different objects; but shall here confine ourselves to the present subject. We find by experience, that there is such a constancy in almost all the impressions of the senses, that their interruption produces no alteration on them, and hinders them not from returning the same in appearance and in situation as at their first existence. I survey the furniture of my chamber; I shut my eyes, and afterwards open them; and find the new perceptions to resemble perfectly those, which formerly struck my senses. This resemblance is observ'd in a thousand instances, and naturally connects together our ideas of these interrupted perceptions by the strongest relation, and conveys the mind with an easy transition from one to another. An easy transition or passage of the imagination, along the ideas of these different and interrupted perceptions, is almost the same disposition of mind with that in which we consider one constant and uninterrupted perception. 'Tis therefore very natural for us to mistake the one for the other.
      <br>&emsp;The persons, who entertain this opinion concerning the identity of our resembling perceptions, are in general all the unthinking and unphilosophical part of mankind, (that is, all of us, at one time or other) and consequently such as suppose their perceptions to be their only objects, and never think of a double existence internal and external, representing and represented. The very image, which is present to the senses, is with us the real body; and 'tis to these interrupted images we ascribe a perfect identity. But as the interruption of the appearance seems contrary to the identity, and naturally leads us to regard these resembling perceptions as different from each other, we here find ourselves at a loss how to reconcile such opposite opinions. The smooth passage of the imagination along the ideas of the resembling perceptions makes us ascribe to them a perfect identity. The interrupted manner of their appearance makes us consider them as so many resembling, but still distinct beings, which appear after certain intervals. The perplexity arising from this contradiction produces a propension to unite these broken appearances by the fiction of a continu'd existence, which is the third part of that hypothesis I propos'd to explain.
      <br>&emsp;Nothing is more certain from experience, than that any contradiction either to the sentiments or passions gives a sensible uneasiness, whether it proceeds from without or from within; from the opposition of external objects, or from the combat of internal principles. On the contrary, whatever strikes in with the natural propensities, and either externally forwards their satisfaction, or internally concurs with their movements, is sure to give a sensible pleasure. Now there being here an opposition betwixt the notion of the identity of resembling perceptions, and the interruption of their appearance, the mind must be uneasy in that situation, and will naturally seek relief from the uneasiness. Since the uneasiness arises from the opposition of two contrary principles, it must look for relief by sacrificing the one to the other. But as the smooth passage of our thought along our resembling perceptions makes us ascribe to them an identity, we can never without reluctance yield up that opinion. We must, therefore, turn to the other side, and suppose that our perceptions are no longer interrupted, but preserve a continu'd as well as an invariable existence, and are by that means entirely the same. But here the interruptions in the appearance of these perceptions are so long and frequent, that 'tis impossible to overlook them; and as the appearance of a perception in the mind and its existence seem at first sight entirely the same, it may be doubted, whether we can ever assent to so palpable a contradiction, and suppose a perception to exist without being present to the mind. In order to clear up this matter, and learn how the interruption in the appearance of a perception implies not necessarily an interruption in its existence, 'twill be proper to touch upon some principles, which we shall have occasion to explain more fully afterwards.
      <br>&emsp;We may begin with observing, that the difficulty in the present case is not concerning the matter of fact, or whether the mind forms such a conclusion concerning the continu'd existence of its perceptions, but only concerning the manner in which the conclusion is form'd, and principles from which it is deriv'd. 'Tis certain, that almost all mankind, and even philosophers themselves, for the greatest part of their lives, take their perceptions to be their only objects, and suppose, that the very being, which is intimately present to the mind, is the real body or material existence. 'Tis also certain, that this very perception or object is suppos'd to have a continu'd uninterrupted being, and neither to be annihilated by our absence, nor to be brought into existence by our presence. When we are absent from it, we say it still exists, but that we do not feel, we do not see it. When we are present, we say we feel, or see it. Here then may arise two questions; First, How we can satisfy ourselves in supposing a perception to be absent from the mind without being annihilated. Secondly, After what manner we conceive an object to become present to the mind, without some new creation of a perception or image; and what we mean by this seeing, and feeling, and perceiving.
      <br>&emsp;As to the first question; we may observe, that what we call a mind, is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions, united together by certain relations, and suppos'd, tho' falsely, to be endow'd with a perfect simplicity and identity. Now as every perception is distinguishable from another, and may be consider'd as separately existent; it evidently follows, that there is no absurdity in separating any particular perception from the mind; that is, in breaking off all its relations, with that connected mass of perceptions, which constitute a thinking being.
      <br>&emsp;The same reasoning affords us an answer to the second question. If the name of perception renders not this separation from a mind absurd and contradictory, the name of object, standing for the very same thing, can never render their conjunction impossible. External objects are seen, and felt, and become present to the mind; that is, they acquire such a relation to a connected heap of perceptions, as to influence them very considerably in augmenting their number by present reflections and passions, and in storing the memory with ideas. The same continu'd and uninterrupted Being may, therefore, be sometimes present to the mind, and sometimes absent from it, without any real or essential change in the Being itself. An interrupted appearance to the senses implies not necessarily an interruption in the existence. The supposition of the continu'd existence of sensible objects or perceptions involves no contradiction. We may easily indulge our inclination to that supposition. When the exact resemblance of our perceptions makes us ascribe to them an identity, we may remove the seeming interruption by feigning a continu'd being, which may fill those intervals, and preserve a perfect and entire identity to our perceptions.
      <br>&emsp;But as we here not only feign but believe this continu'd existence, the question is, from whence arises such a belief; and this question leads us to the fourth member of this system. It has been prov'd already, that belief in general consists in nothing, but the vivacity of an idea; and that an idea may acquire this vivacity by its relation to some present impression. Impressions are naturally the most vivid perceptions of the mind; and this quality is in part convey'd by the relation to every connected idea. The relation causes a smooth passage from the impression to the idea, and even gives a propensity to that passage. The mind falls so easily from the one perception to the other, that it scarce perceives the change, but retains in the second a considerable share of the vivacity of the first. It is excited by the lively impression; and this vivacity is convey'd to the related idea, without any great diminution in the passage, by reason of the smooth transition and the propensity of the imagination.
      <br>&emsp;But suppose, that this propensity arises from some other principle, besides that of relation; 'tis evident it must still have the same effect, and convey the vivacity from the impression to the idea. Now this is exactly the present case. Our memory presents us with a vast number of instances of perceptions perfectly resembling each other, that return at different distances of time, and after considerable interruptions. This resemblance gives us a propension to consider these interrupted perceptions as the same; and also a propension to connect them by a continu'd existence, in order to justify this identity, and avoid the contradiction, in which the interrupted appearance of these perceptions seems necessarily to involve us. Here then we have a propensity to feign the continu'd existence of all sensible objects; and as this propensity arises from some lively impressions of the memory, it bestows a vivacity on that fiction; or in other words, makes us believe the continu'd existence of body. If sometimes we ascribe a continu'd existence to objects, which are perfectly new to us, and of whose constancy and coherence we have no experience, 'tis because the manner, in which they present themselves to our senses, resembles that of constant and coherent objects; and this resemblance is a source of reasoning and analogy, and leads us to attribute the same qualities to the similar objects.
      <br>&emsp;I believe an intelligent reader will find less difficulty to assent to this system, than to comprehend it fully and distinctly, and will allow, after a little reflection, that every part carries its own proof along with it. 'Tis indeed evident, that as the vulgar suppose their perceptions to be their only objects, and at the same time believe the continu'd existence of matter, we must account for the origin of the belief upon that supposition. Now upon that supposition, 'tis a false opinion that any of our objects, or perceptions, are identically the same after an interruption; and consequently the opinion of their identity can never arise from reason, but must arise from the imagination. The imagination is seduc'd into such an opinion only by means of the resemblance of certain perceptions; since we find they are only our resembling perceptions, which we have a propension to suppose the same. This propension to bestow an identity on our resembling perceptions, produces the fiction of a continu'd existence; since that fiction, as well as the identity, is really false, as is acknowledg'd by all philosophers, and has no other effect than to remedy the interruption of our perceptions, which is the only circumstance that is contrary to their identity. In the last place this propension causes belief by means of the present impressions of the memory; since without the remembrance of former sensations, 'tis plain we never shou'd have any belief of the continu'd existence of body. Thus in examining all these parts, we find that each of them is supported by the strongest proofs; and that all of them together form a consistent system, which is perfectly convincing. A strong propensity or inclination alone, without any present impression, will sometimes cause a belief or opinion. How much more when aided by that circumstance?
      <br>&emsp;But tho' we are led after this manner, by the natural propensity of the imagination, to ascribe a continu'd existence to those sensible objects or perceptions, which we find to resemble each other in their interrupted appearance; yet a very little reflection and philosophy is sufficient to make us perceive the fallacy of that opinion. I have already observ'd, that there is an intimate connexion betwixt those two principles, of a continu'd and of a distinct or independent existence, and that we no sooner establish the one than the other follows, as a necessary consequence. 'Tis the opinion of a continu'd existence, which first takes place, and without much study or reflection draws the other along with it, wherever the mind follows its first and most natural tendency. But when we compare experiments, and reason a little upon them, we quickly perceive, that the doctrine of the independent existence of our sensible perceptions is contrary to the plainest experience. This leads us backward upon our footsteps to perceive our error in attributing a continu'd existence to our perceptions, and is the origin of many very curious opinions, which we shall here endeavour to account for.
      <br>&emsp;'Twill first be proper to observe a few of those experiments, which convince us, that our perceptions are not possest of any independent existence. When we press one eye with a finger, we immediately perceive all the objects to become double, and one half of them to be remov'd from their common and natural position. But as we do not attribute a continu'd existence to both these perceptions, and as they are both of the same nature, we clearly perceive, that all our perceptions are dependent on our organs, and the disposition of our nerves and animal spirits. This opinion is confirm'd by the seeming encrease and diminution of objects, according to their distance; by the apparent alterations in their figure; by the changes in their colour and other qualities from our sickness and distempers; and by an infinite number of other experiments of the same kind; from all which we learn, that our sensible perceptions are not possest of any distinct or independent existence.
      <br>&emsp;The natural consequence of this reasoning shou'd be, that our perceptions have no more a continu'd than an independent existence; and indeed philosophers have so far run into this opinion, that they change their system, and distinguish, (as we shall do for the future) betwixt perceptions and objects, of which the former are suppos'd to be interrupted, and perishing, and different at every different return; the latter to be uninterrupted, and to preserve a continu'd existence and identity. But however philosophical this new system may be esteem'd, I assert that 'tis only a palliative remedy, and that it contains all the difficulties of the vulgar system, with some others, that are peculiar to itself. There are no principles either of the understanding or fancy, which lead us directly to embrace this opinion of the double existence of perceptions and objects, nor can we arrive at it but by passing thro' the common hypothesis of the identity and continuance of our interrupted perceptions. Were we not first perswaded, that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue to exist even when they no longer make their appearance to the senses, we shou'd never be led to think, that our perceptions and objects are different, and that our objects alone preserve a continu'd existence. The latter hypothesis has no primary recommendation either to reason or the imagination, but acquires all its influence on the imagination from the former. This proposition contains two parts, which we shall endeavour to prove as distinctly and clearly, as such abstruse subjects will permit.
      <br>&emsp;As to the first part of the proposition, that this philosophical hypothesis has no primary recommendation, either to reason or the imagination, we may soon satisfy ourselves with regard to reason by the following reflections. The only existences, of which we are certain, are perceptions, which being immediately present to us by consciousness, command our strongest assent, and are the first foundation of all our conclusions. The only conclusion we can draw from the existence of one thing to that of another, is by means of the relation of cause and effect, which shews, that there is a connexion betwixt them, and that the existence of one is dependent on that of the other. The idea of this relation is deriv'd from past experience, by which we find, that two beings are constantly conjoin'd together, and are always present at once to the mind. But as no beings are ever present to the mind but perceptions; it follows that we may observe a conjunction or a relation of cause and effect between different perceptions, but can never observe it between perceptions and objects. 'Tis impossible, therefore, that from the existence or any of the qualities of the former, we can ever form any conclusion concerning the existence of the latter, or ever satisfy our reason in this particular.
      <br>&emsp;'Tis no less certain, that this philosophical system has no primary recommendation to the imagination, and that that faculty wou'd never, of itself, and by its original tendency, have fallen upon such a principle. I confess it will be somewhat difficult to prove this to the full satisfaction of the reader; because it implies a negative, which in many cases will not admit of any positive proof. If any one wou'd take the pains to examine this question, and wou'd invent a system, to account for the direct origin of this opinion from the imagination, we shou'd be able, by the examination of that system, to pronounce a certain judgment in the present subject. Let it be taken for granted, that our perceptions are broken, and interrupted, and however like, are still different from each other; and let any one upon this supposition shew why the fancy, directly and immediately, proceeds to the belief of another existence, resembling these perceptions in their nature, but yet continu'd, and uninterrupted, and identical; and after he has done this to my satisfaction, I promise to renounce my present opinion. Mean while I cannot forbear concluding, from the very abstractedness and difficulty of the first supposition, that 'tis an improper subject for the fancy to work upon. Whoever wou'd explain the origin of the common opinion concerning the continu'd and distinct existence of body, must take the mind in its common situation, and must proceed upon the supposition, that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue to exist even when they are not perceiv'd. Tho' this opinion be false, 'tis the most natural of any, and has alone any primary recommendation to the fancy.
      <br>&emsp;As to the second part of the proposition, that the philosophical system acquires all its influence on the imagination from the vulgar one; we may observe, that this is a natural and unavoidable consequence of the foregoing conclusion, that it has no primary recommendation to reason or the imagination. For as the philosophical system is found by experience to take hold of many minds, and in particular of all those, who reflect ever so little on this subject, it must derive all its authority from the vulgar system; since it has no original authority of its own. The manner, in which these two systems, tho' directly contrary, are connected together, may be explain'd, as follows.
      <br>&emsp;The imagination naturally runs on in this train of thinking. Our perceptions are our only objects: Resembling perceptions are the same, however broken or uninterrupted in their appearance: This appearing interruption is contrary to the identity: The interruption consequently extends not beyond the appearance, and the perception or object really continues to exist, even when absent from us: Our sensible perceptions have, therefore, a continu'd and uninterrupted existence. But as a little reflection destroys this conclusion, that our perceptions have a continu'd existence, by shewing that they have a dependent one, 'twou'd naturally be expected, that we must altogether reject the opinion, that there is such a thing in nature as a continu'd existence, which is preserv'd even when it no longer appears to the senses. The case, however, is otherwise. Philosophers are so far from rejecting the opinion of a continu'd existence upon rejecting that of the independence and continuance of our sensible perceptions, that tho' all sects agree in the latter sentiment, the former, which is, in a manner, its necessary consequence, has been peculiar to a few extravagant sceptics; who after all maintain'd that opinion in words only, and were never able to bring themselves sincerely to believe it.
      <br>&emsp;There is a great difference betwixt such opinions as we form after a calm and profound reflection, and such as we embrace by a kind of instinct or natural impulse, on account of their suitableness and conformity to the mind. If these opinions become contrary, 'tis not difficult to foresee which of them will have the advantage. As long as our attention is bent upon the subject, the philosophical and study'd principle may prevail; but the moment we relax our thoughts, nature will display herself, and draw us back to our former opinion. Nay she has sometimes such an influence, that she can stop our progress, even in the midst of our most profound reflections, and keep us from running on with all the consequences of any philosophical opinion. Thus tho' we clearly perceive the dependence and interruption of our perceptions, we stop short in our carreer, and never upon that account reject the notion of an independent and continu'd existence. That opinion has taken such deep root in the imagination, that 'tis impossible ever to eradicate it, nor will any strain'd metaphysical conviction of the dependence of our perceptions be sufficient for that purpose.
      <br>&emsp;But tho' our natural and obvious principles here prevail above our study'd reflections, 'tis certain there must be some struggle and opposition in the case; at least so long as these reflections retain any force or vivacity. In order to set ourselves at ease in this particular, we contrive a new hypothesis, which seems to comprehend both these principles of reason and imagination. This hypothesis is the philosophical one of the double existence of perceptions and objects; which pleases our reason, in allowing, that our dependent perceptions are interrupted and different; and at the same time is agreeable to the imagination, in attributing a continu'd existence to something else, which we call objects. This philosophical system, therefore, is the monstrous offspring of two principles, which are contrary to each other, which are both at once embrac'd by the mind, and which are unable mutually to destroy each other. The imagination tells us, that our resembling perceptions have a continu'd and uninterrupted existence, and are not annihilated by their absence. Reflection tells us, that even our resembling perceptions are interrupted in their existence, and different from each other. The contradiction betwixt these opinions we elude by a new fiction, which is conformable to the hypotheses both of reflection and fancy, by ascribing these contrary qualities to different existences; the interruption to perceptions, and the continuance to objects. Nature is obstinate, and will not quit the field, however strongly attack'd by reason; and at the same time reason is so clear in the point, that there is no possibility of disguising her. Not being able to reconcile these two enemies, we endeavour to set ourselves at ease as much as possible, by successively granting to each whatever it demands, and by feigning a double existence, where each may find something, that has all the conditions it desires. Were we fully convinc'd, that our resembling perceptions are continu'd, and identical, and independent, we shou'd never run into this opinion of a double existence; since we shou'd find satisfaction in our first supposition, and wou'd not look beyond. Again, were we fully convinc'd, that our perceptions are dependent, and interrupted, and different, we shou'd be as little inclin'd to embrace the opinion of a double existence; since in that case we shou'd clearly perceive the error of our first supposition of a continu'd existence, and wou'd never regard it any farther. 'Tis therefore from the intermediate situation of the mind, that this opinion arises, and from such an adherence to these two contrary principles, as makes us seek some pretext to justify our receiving both; which happily at last is found in the system of a double existence.
      <br>&emsp;Another advantage of this philosophical system is its similarity to the vulgar one; by which means we can humour our reason for a moment, when it becomes troublesome and sollicitous; and yet upon its least negligence or inattention, can easily return to our vulgar and natural notions. Accordingly we find, that philosophers neglect not this advantage; but immediately upon leaving their closets, mingle with the rest of mankind in those exploded opinions, that our perceptions are our only objects, and continue identically and uninterruptedly the same in all their interrupted appearances.
      <br>&emsp;There are other particulars of this system, wherein we may remark its dependence on the fancy, in a very conspicuous manner. Of these, I shall observe the two following. First, We suppose external objects to resemble internal perceptions. I have already shewn, that the relation of cause and effect can never afford us any just conclusion from the existence or qualities of our perceptions to the existence of external continu'd objects: And I shall farther add, that even tho' they cou'd afford such a conclusion, we shou'd never have any reason to infer, that our objects resemble our perceptions. That opinion, therefore, is deriv'd from nothing but the quality of the fancy above-explain'd, that it borrows all its ideas from some precedent perception. We never can conceive any thing but perceptions, and therefore must make every thing resemble them.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly, As we suppose our objects in general to resemble our perceptions, so we take it for granted, that every particular object resembles that perception, which it causes. The relation of cause and effect determines us to join the other of resemblance; and the ideas of these existences being already united together in the fancy by the former relation, we naturally add the latter to compleat the union. We have a strong propensity to compleat every union by joining new relations to those which we have before observ'd betwixt any ideas, as we shall have occasion to observe presently.
      <br>&emsp;Having thus given an account of all the systems both popular and philosophical, with regard to external existences, I cannot forbear giving vent to a certain sentiment, which arises upon reviewing those systems. I begun this subject with premising, that we ought to have an implicit faith in our senses, and that this wou'd be the conclusion, I shou'd draw from the whole of my reasoning. But to be ingenuous, I feel myself at present of a quite contrary sentiment, and am more inclin'd to repose no faith at all in my senses, or rather imagination, than to place in it such an implicit confidence. I cannot conceive how such trivial qualities of the fancy, conducted by such false suppositions, can ever lead to any solid and rational system. They are the coherence and constancy of our perceptions, which produce the opinion of their continu'd existence; tho' these qualities of perceptions have no perceivable connexion with such an existence. The constancy of our perceptions has the most considerable effect, and yet is attended with the greatest difficulties. 'Tis a gross illusion to suppose, that our resembling perceptions are numerically the same; and 'tis this illusion, which leads us into the opinion, that these perceptions are uninterrupted, and are still existent, even when they are not present to the senses. This is the case with our popular system. And as to our philosophical one, 'tis liable to the same difficulties; and is over-and-above loaded with this absurdity, that it at once denies and establishes the vulgar supposition. Philosophers deny our resembling perceptions to be identically the same, and uninterrupted; and yet have so great a propensity to believe them such, that they arbitrarily invent a new set of perceptions, to which they attribute these qualities. I say, a new set of perceptions: For we may well suppose in general, but 'tis impossible for us distinctly to conceive, objects to be in their nature any thing but exactly the same with perceptions. What then can we look for from this confusion of groundless and extraordinary opinions but error and falshood? And how can we justify to ourselves any belief we repose in them?
      <br>&emsp;This sceptical doubt, both with respect to reason and the senses, is a malady, which can never be radically cur'd, but must return upon us every moment, however we may chace it away, and sometimes may seem entirely free from it. 'Tis impossible upon any system to defend either our understanding or senses; and we but expose them farther when we endeavour to justify them in that manner. As the sceptical doubt arises naturally from a profound and intense reflection on those subjects, it always encreases, the farther we carry our reflections, whether in opposition or conformity to it. Carelessness and in-attention alone can afford us any remedy. For this reason I rely entirely upon them; and take it for granted, whatever may be the reader's opinion at this present moment, that an hour hence he will be persuaded there is both an external and internal world; and going upon that supposition, I intend to examine some general systems both ancient and modern, which have been propos'd of both, before I proceed to a more particular enquiry concerning our impressions. This will not, perhaps, in the end be found foreign to our present purpose.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="antientphilosophy">
      Several moralists have recommended it as an excellent method of becoming acquainted with our own hearts, and knowing our progress in virtue, to recollect our dreams in a morning, and examine them with the same rigour, that we wou'd our most serious and most deliberate actions. Our character is the same throughout, say they, and appears best where artifice, fear, and policy have no place, and men can neither be hypocrites with themselves nor others. The generosity, or baseness of our temper, our meekness or cruelty, our courage or pusilanimity, influence the fictions of the imagination with the most unbounded liberty, and discover themselves in the most glaring colours. In like manner, I am persuaded, there might be several useful discoveries made from a criticism of the fictions of the antient philosophy, concerning substances, and substantial forms, and accidents, and occult qualities; which, however unreasonable and capricious, have a very intimate connexion with the principles of human nature.
      <br>&emsp;'Tis confest by the most judicious philosophers, that our ideas of bodies are nothing but collections form'd by the mind of the ideas of the several distinct sensible qualities, of which objects are compos'd, and which we find to have a constant union with each other. But however these qualities may in themselves be entirely distinct, 'tis certain we commonly regard the compound, which they form, as One thing, and as continuing the Same under very considerable alterations. The acknowledg'd composition is evidently contrary to this suppos'd simplicity, and the variation to the identity. It may, therefore, be worth while to consider the causes, which make us almost universally fall into such evident contradictions, as well as the means by which we endeavour to conceal them.
      <br>&emsp;'Tis evident, that as the ideas of the several distinct successive qualities of objects are united together by a very close relation, the mind, in looking along the succession, must be carry'd from one part of it to another by an easy transition, and will no more perceive the change, than if it contemplated the same unchangeable object. This easy transition is the effect, or rather essence of relation; and as the imagination readily takes one idea for another, where their influence on the mind is similar; hence it proceeds, that any such succession of related qualities is readily consider'd as one continu'd object, existing without any variation. The smooth and uninterrupted progress of the thought, being alike in both cases, readily deceives the mind, and makes us ascribe an identity to the changeable succession of connected qualities.
      <br>&emsp;But when we alter our method of considering the succession, and instead of traceing it gradually thro' the successive points of time, survey at once any two distinct periods of its duration, and compare the different conditions of the successive qualities; in that case the variations, which were insensible when they arose gradually, do now appear of consequence, and seem entirely to destroy the identity. By this means there arises a kind of contrariety in our method of thinking, from the different points of view, in which we survey the object, and from the nearness or remoteness of those instants of time, which we compare together. When we gradually follow an object in its successive changes, the smooth progress of the thought makes us ascribe an identity to the succession; because 'tis by a similar act of the mind we consider an unchangeable object. When we compare its situation after a considerable change the progress of the thought is broke; and consequently we are presented with the idea of diversity: In order to reconcile which contradictions the imagination is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes to continue the same under all these variations; and this unintelligible something it calls a substance, or original and first matter.
      <br>&emsp;We entertain a like notion with regard to the simplicity of substances, and from like causes. Suppose an object perfectly simple and indivisible to be presented, along with another object, whose co-existent parts are connected together by a strong relation, 'tis evident the actions of the mind, in considering these two objects, are not very different. The imagination conceives the simple object at once, with facility, by a single effort of thought, without change or variation. The connexion of parts in the compound object has almost the same effect, and so unites the object within itself, that the fancy feels not the transition in passing from one part to another. Hence the colour, taste, figure, solidity, and other qualities, combin'd in a peach or melon, are conceiv'd to form one thing; and that on account of their close relation, which makes them affect the thought in the same manner, as if perfectly uncompounded. But the mind rests not here. Whenever it views the object in another light, it finds that all these qualities are different, and distinguishable, and separable from each other; which view of things being destructive of its primary and more natural notions, obliges the imagination to feign an unknown something, or original substance and matter, as a principle of union or cohesion among these qualities, and as what may give the compound object a title to be call'd one thing, notwithstanding its diversity and composition.
      <br>&emsp;The peripatetic philosophy asserts the original matter to be perfectly homogeneous in all bodies, and considers fire, water, earth, and air, as of the very same substance; on account of their gradual revolutions and changes into each other. At the same time it assigns to each of these species of objects a distinct substantial form, which it supposes to be the source of all those different qualities they possess, and to be a new foundation of simplicity and identity to each particular species. All depends on our manner of viewing the objects. When we look along the insensible changes of bodies, we suppose all of them to be of the same substance or essence. When we consider their sensible differences, we attribute to each of them a substantial and essential difference. And in order to indulge ourselves in both these ways of considering our objects, we suppose all bodies to have at once a substance and a substantial form.
      <br>&emsp;The notion of accidents is an unavoidable consequence of this method of thinking with regard to substances and substantial forms; nor can we forbear looking upon colours, sounds, tastes, figures, and other properties of bodies, as existences, which cannot subsist apart, but require a subject of inhesion to sustain and support them. For having never discover'd any of these sensible qualities, where, for the reasons above-mention'd, we did not likewise fancy a substance to exist; the same habit, which makes us infer a connexion betwixt cause and effect, makes us here infer a dependance of every quality on the unknown substance. The custom of imagining a dependance has the same effect as the custom of observing it wou'd have. This conceit, however, is no more reasonable than any of the foregoing. Every quality being a distinct thing from another, may be conceiv'd to exist apart, and may exist apart, not only from every other quality, but from that unintelligible chimera of a substance.
      <br>&emsp;But these philosophers carry their fictions still farther in their sentiments concerning occult qualities, and both suppose a substance supporting, which they do not understand, and an accident supported, of which they have as imperfect an idea. The whole system, therefore, is entirely incomprehensible, and yet is deriv'd from principles as natural as any of these above-explain'd.
      <br>&emsp;In considering this subject we may observe a gradation of three opinions, that rise above each other, according as the persons, who form them, acquire new degrees of reason and knowledge. These opinions are that of the vulgar, that of a false philosophy, and that of the true; where we shall find upon enquiry, that the true philosophy approaches nearer to the sentiments of the vulgar, than to those of a mistaken knowledge. 'Tis natural for men, in their common and careless way of thinking, to imagine they perceive a connexion betwixt such objects as they have constantly found united together; and because custom has render'd it difficult to separate the ideas, they are apt to fancy such a separation to be in itself impossible and absurd. But philosophers, who abstract from the effects of custom, and compare the ideas of objects, immediately perceive the falshood of these vulgar sentiments, and discover that there is no known connexion among objects. Every different object appears to them entirely distinct and separate; and they perceive, that 'tis not from a view of the nature and qualities of objects we infer one from another, but only when in several instances we observe them to have been constantly conjoin'd. But these philosophers, instead of drawing a just inference from this observation, and concluding, that we have no idea of power or agency, separate from the mind, and belonging to causes; I say, instead of drawing this conclusion, they frequently search for the qualities, in which this agency consists, and are displeas'd with every system, which their reason suggests to them, in order to explain it. They have sufficient force of genius to free them from the vulgar error, that there is a natural and perceivable connexion betwixt the several sensible qualities and actions of matter; but not sufficient to keep them from ever seeking for this connexion in matter, or causes. Had they fallen upon the just conclusion, they wou'd have return'd back to the situation of the vulgar, and wou'd have regarded all these disquisitions with indolence and indifference. At present they seem to be in a very lamentable condition, and such as the poets have given us but a faint notion of in their descriptions of the punishment of Sisyphus and Tantalus. For what can be imagin'd more tormenting, than to seek with eagerness, what for ever flies us; and seek for it in a place, where 'tis impossible it can ever exist?
      <br>&emsp;But as nature seems to have observ'd a kind of justice and compensation in every thing, she has not neglected philosophers more than the rest of the creation; but has reserv'd them a consolation amid all their disappointments and afflictions. This consolation principally consists in their invention of the words faculty and occult quality. For it being usual, after the frequent use of terms, which are really significant and intelligible, to omit the idea, which we wou'd express by them, and to preserve only the custom, by which we recal the idea at pleasure; so it naturally happens, that after the frequent use of terms, which are wholly insignificant and unintelligible, we fancy them to be on the same footing with the precedent, and to have a secret meaning, which we might discover by reflection. The resemblance of their appearance deceives the mind, as is usual, and makes us imagine a thorough resemblance and conformity. By this means these philosophers set themselves at ease, and arrive at last, by an illusion, at the same indifference, which the people attain by their stupidity, and true philosophers by their moderate scepticism. They need only say, that any phænomenon, which puzzles them, arises from a faculty or an occult quality, and there is an end of all dispute and enquiry upon the matter.
      <br>&emsp;But among all the instances, wherein the Peripatetics have shewn they were guided by every trivial propensity of the imagination, no one is more remarkable than their sympathies, antipathies, and horrors of a vacuum. There is a very remarkable inclination in human nature, to bestow on external objects the same emotions, which it observes in itself; and to find every where those ideas, which are most present to it. This inclination, 'tis true, is suppress'd by a little reflection, and only takes place in children, poets, and the antient philosophers. It appears in children, by their desire of beating the stones, which hurt them: In poets, by their readiness to personify every thing: And in the antient philosophers, by these fictions of sympathy and antipathy. We must pardon children, because of their age; poets, because they profess to follow implicitly the suggestions of their fancy: But what excuse shall we find to justify our philosophers in so signal a weakness?
      </div>
      <div class="content-text hidden"id="modernphilosophy">
      But here it may be objected, that the imagination, according to my own confession, being the ultimate judge of all systems of philosophy, I am unjust in blaming the antient philosophers for makeing use of that faculty, and allowing themselves to be entirely guided by it in their reasonings. In order to justify myself, I must distinguish in the imagination betwixt the principles which are permanent, irresistable, and universal; such as the customary transition from causes to effects, and from effects to causes: And the principles, which are changeable, weak, and irregular; such as those I have just now taken notice of. The former are the foundation of all our thoughts and actions, so that upon their removal human nature must immediately perish and go to ruin. The latter are neither unavoidable to mankind, nor necessary, or so much as useful in the conduct of life; but on the contrary are observ'd only to take place in weak minds, and being opposite to the other principles of custom and reasoning, may easily be subverted by a due contrast and opposition. For this reason the former are received by philosophy, and the latter rejected. One who concludes somebody to be near him, when he hears an articulate voice in the dark, reasons justly and naturally; tho' that conclusion be deriv'd from nothing but custom, which infixes and inlivens the idea of a human creature, on account of his usual conjunction with the present impression. But one, who is tormented he knows not why, with the apprehension of spectres in the dark, may, perhaps, be said to reason, and to reason naturally too: But then it must be in the same sense, that a malady is said to be natural; as arising from natural causes, tho' it be contrary to health, the most agreeable and most natural situation of man.
      <br>&emsp;The opinions of the antient philosophers, their fictions of substance and accident, and their reasonings concerning substantial forms and occult qualities, are like the spectres in the dark, and are deriv'd from principles, which, however common, are neither universal nor unavoidable in human nature. The modern philosophy pretends to be entirely free from this defect, and to arise only from the solid, permanent, and consistent principles of the imagination. Upon what grounds this pretension is founded must now be the subject of our enquiry.
      <br>&emsp;The fundamental principle of that philosophy is the opinion concerning colours, sounds, tastes, smells, heat and cold; which it asserts to be nothing but impressions in the mind, deriv'd from the operation of external objects, and without any resemblance to the qualities of the objects. Upon examination, I find only one of the reasons commonly produc'd for this opinion to be satisfactory, viz. that deriv'd from the variations of those impressions, even while the external object, to all appearance, continues the same. These variations depend upon several circumstances. Upon the different situations of our health: A man in a malady feels a disagreeable taste in meats, which before pleas'd him the most. Upon the different complexions and constitutions of men: That seems bitter to one, which is sweet to another. Upon the difference of their external situation and position: Colours reflected from the clouds change according to the distance of the clouds, and according to the angle they make with the eye and luminous body. Fire also communicates the sensation of pleasure at one distance, and that of pain at another. Instances of this kind are very numerous and frequent.
      <br>&emsp;The conclusion drawn from them, is likewise as satisfactory as can possibly be imagin'd. 'Tis certain, that when different impressions of the same sense arise from any object, every one of these impressions has not a resembling quality existent in the object. For as the same object cannot, at the same time, be endow'd with different qualities of the same sense, and as the same quality cannot resemble impressions entirely different; it evidently follows, that many of our impressions have no external model or archetype. Now from like effects we presume like causes. Many of the impressions of colour, sound, &c. are confest to be nothing but internal existences, and to arise from causes, which no ways resemble them. These impressions are in appearance nothing different from the other impressions of colour, sound, &c. We conclude, therefore, that they are, all of them, deriv'd from a like origin.
      <br>&emsp;This principle being once admitted, all the other doctrines of that philosophy seem to follow by an easy consequence. For upon the removal of sounds, colours, heat, cold, and other sensible qualities, from the rank of continu'd independent existences, we are reduc'd merely to what are called primary qualities, as the only real ones, of which we have any adequate notion. These primary qualities are extension and solidity, with their different mixtures and modifications; figure, motion, gravity, and cohesion. The generation, encrease, decay, and corruption of animals and vegetables, are nothing but changes of figure and motion; as also the operations of all bodies on each other; of fire, of light, water, air, earth, and of all the elements and powers of nature. One figure and motion produces another figure and motion; nor does there remain in the material universe any other principle, either active or passive, of which we can form the most distant idea.
      <br>&emsp;I believe many objections might be made to this system: But at present I shall confine myself to one, which is in my opinion very decisive. I assert, that instead of explaining the operations of external objects by its means, we utterly annihilate all these objects, and reduce ourselves to the opinions of the most extravagant scepticism concerning them. If colours, sounds, tastes, and smells be merely perceptions, nothing we can conceive is possest of a real, continu'd, and independent existence; not even motion, extension and solidity, which are the primary qualities chiefly insisted on.
      <br>&emsp;To begin with the examination of motion; 'tis evident this is a quality altogether inconceivable alone, and without a reference to some other object. The idea of motion necessarily supposes that of a body moving. Now what is our idea of the moving body, without which motion is incomprehensible? It must resolve itself into the idea of extension or of solidity; and consequently the reality of motion depends upon that of these other qualities.
      <br>&emsp;This opinion, which is universally acknowledg'd concerning motion, I have prov'd to be true with regard to extension; and have shewn that 'tis impossible to conceive extension, but as compos'd of parts, endow'd with colour or solidity. The idea of extension is a compound idea; but as it is not compounded of an infinite number of parts or inferior ideas, it must at last resolve itself into such as are perfectly simple and indivisible. These simple and indivisible parts, not being ideas of extension, must be non-entities, unless conceiv'd as colour'd or solid. Colour is excluded from any real existence. The reality, therefore, of our idea of extension depends upon the reality of that of solidity, nor can the former be just while the latter is chimerical. Let us, then, lend our attention to the examination of the idea of solidity.
      <br>&emsp;The idea of solidity is that of two objects, which being impell'd by the utmost force, cannot penetrate each other; but still maintain a separate and distinct existence. Solidity, therefore, is perfectly incomprehensible alone, and without the conception of some bodies, which are solid, and maintain this separate and distinct existence. Now what idea have we of these bodies? The ideas of colours, sounds, and other secondary qualities are excluded. The idea of motion depends on that of extension, and the idea of extension on that of solidity. 'Tis impossible, therefore, that the idea of solidity can depend on either of them. For that wou'd be to run in a circle, and make one idea depend on another, while at the same time the latter depends on the former. Our modern philosophy, therefore, leaves us no just nor satisfactory idea of solidity; nor consequently of matter.
      <br>&emsp;This argument will appear entirely conclusive to every one that comprehends it; but because it may seem abstruse and intricate to the generality of readers, I hope to be excus'd, if I endeavour to render it more obvious by some variation of the expression. In order to form an idea of solidity, we must conceive two bodies pressing on each other without any penetration; and 'tis impossible to arrive at this idea, when we confine ourselves to one object, much more without conceiving any. Two non-entities cannot exclude each other from their places; because they never possess any place, nor can be endow'd with any quality. Now I ask, what idea do we form of these bodies or objects, to which we suppose solidity to belong? To say, that we conceive them merely as solid, is to run on in infinitum. To affirm, that we paint them out to ourselves as extended, either resolves all into a false idea, or returns in a circle. Extension must necessarily be consider'd either as colour'd, which is a false idea; or as solid, which brings us back to the first question. We may make the same observation concerning mobility and figure; and upon the whole must conclude, that after the exclusion of colours, sounds, heat and cold from the rank of external existences, there remains nothing, which can afford us a just and consistent idea of body.
      <br>&emsp;Add to this, that, properly speaking, solidity or impenetrability is nothing, but an impossibility of annihilation, as has been already observ'd: For which reason 'tis the more necessary for us to form some distinct idea of that object, whose annihilation we suppose impossible. An impossibility of being annihilated cannot exist, and can never be conceived to exist, by itself; but necessarily requires some object or real existence, to which it may belong. Now the difficulty still remains, how to form an idea of this object or existence, without having recourse to the secondary and sensible qualities.
      <br>&emsp;Nor must we omit on this occasion our accustom'd method of examining ideas by considering those impressions, from which they are deriv'd. The impressions, which enter by the sight and hearing, the smell and taste, are affirm'd by modern philosophy to be without any resembling objects; and consequently the idea of solidity, which is suppos'd to be real, can never be deriv'd from any of these senses. There remains, therefore, the feeling as the only sense, that can convey the impression, which is original to the idea of solidity; and indeed we naturally imagine, that we feel the solidity of bodies, and need but touch any object in order to perceive this quality. But this method of thinking is more popular than philosophical; as will appear from the following reflections.
      <br>&emsp;First, 'Tis easy to observe, that tho' bodies are felt by means of their solidity, yet the feeling is a quite different thing from the solidity; and that they have not the least resemblance to each other. A man, who has the palsey in one hand, has as perfect an idea of impenetrability, when he observes that hand to be supported by the table, as when he feels the same table with the other hand. An object, that presses upon any of our members, meets with resistance; and that resistance, by the motion it gives to the nerves and animal spirits, conveys a certain sensation to the mind; but it does not follow, that the sensation, motion, and resistance are any ways resembling.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly, The impressions of touch are simple impressions, except when consider'd with regard to their extension; which makes nothing to the present purpose: And from this simplicity I infer, that they neither represent solidity, nor any real object. For let us put two cases, viz. that of a man, who presses a stone, or any solid body, with his hand, and that of two stones, which press each other; 'twill readily be allow'd, that these two cases are not in every respect alike, but that in the former there is conjoin'd with the solidity, a feeling or sensation, of which there is no appearance in the latter. In order, therefore, to make these two cases alike, 'tis necessary to remove some part of the impression, which the man feels by his hand, or organ of sensation; and that being impossible in a simple impression, obliges us to remove the whole, and proves that this whole impression has no archetype or model in external objects. To which we may add, that solidity necessarily supposes two bodies, along with contiguity and impulse; which being a compound object, can never be represented by a simple impression. Not to mention, that tho' solidity continues always invariably the same, the impressions of touch change every moment upon us; which is a clear proof that the latter are not representations of the former.
      <br>&emsp;Thus there is a direct and total opposition betwixt our reason and our senses; or more properly speaking, betwixt those conclusions we form from cause and effect, and those that persuade us of the continu'd and independent existence of body. When we reason from cause and effect, we conclude, that neither colour, sound, taste, nor smell have a continu'd and independent existence. When we exclude these sensible qualities there remains nothing in the universe, which has such an existence.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="immaterialitysoul">
      Having found such contradictions and difficulties in every system concerning external objects, and in the idea of matter, which we fancy so clear and determinate, we shall naturally expect still greater difficulties and contradictions in every hypothesis concerning our internal perceptions, and the nature of the mind, which we are apt to imagine so much more obscure, and uncertain. But in this we shou'd deceive ourselves. The intellectual world, tho' involv'd in infinite obscurities, is not perplex'd with any such contradictions, as those we have discover'd in the natural. What is known concerning it, agrees with itself; and what is unknown, we must be contented to leave so.
      <br>&emsp;'Tis true, wou'd we hearken to certain philosophers, they promise to diminish our ignorance; but I am afraid 'tis at the hazard of running us into contradictions, from which the subject is of itself exempted. These philosophers are the curious reasoners concerning the material or immaterial substances, in which they suppose our perceptions to inhere. In order to put a stop to these endless cavils on both sides, I know no better method, than to ask these philosophers in a few words, What they mean by substance and inhesion? And after they have answer'd this question, 'twill then be reasonable, and not till then, to enter seriously into the dispute.
      <br>&emsp;This question we have found impossible to be answer'd with regard to matter and body: But besides that in the case of the mind, it labours under all the same difficulties, 'tis burthen'd with some additional ones, which are peculiar to that subject. As every idea is deriv'd from a precedent impression, had we any idea of the substance of our minds, we must also have an impression of it; which is very difficult, if not impossible, to be conceiv'd. For how can an impression represent a substance, otherwise than by resembling it? And how can an impression resemble a substance, since, according to this philosophy, it is not a substance, and has none of the peculiar qualities or characteristics of a substance?
      <br>&emsp;But leaving the question of what may or may not be, for that other what actually is, I desire those philosophers, who pretend that we have an idea of the substance of our minds, to point out the impression that produces it, and tell distinctly after what manner that impression operates, and from what object it is deriv'd. Is it an impression of sensation or of reflection? Is it pleasant, or painful, or indifferent? Does it attend us at all times, or does it only return at intervals? If at intervals, at what times principally does it return, and by what causes is it produc'd?
      <br>&emsp;If instead of answering these questions, any one shou'd evade the difficulty, by saying, that the definition of a substance is something which may exist by itself; and that this definition ought to satisfy us: Shou'd this be said, I shou'd observe, that this definition agrees to every thing, that can possibly be conceiv'd; and never will serve to distinguish substance from accident, or the soul from its perceptions. For thus I reason. Whatever is clearly conceiv'd may exist; and whatever is clearly conceiv'd, after any manner, may exist after the same manner. This is one principle, which has been already acknowledg'd. Again, every thing, which is different, is distinguishable, and every thing which is distinguishable, is separable by the imagination. This is another principle. My conclusion from both is, that since all our perceptions are different from each other, and from every thing else in the universe, they are also distinct and separable, and may be consider'd as separately existent, and may exist separately, and have no need of any thing else to support their existence. They are, therefore, substances, as far as this definition explains a substance.
      <br>&emsp;Thus neither by considering the first origin of ideas, nor by means of a definition are we able to arrive at any satisfactory notion of substance; which seems to me a sufficient reason for abandoning utterly that dispute concerning the materiality and immateriality of the soul, and makes me absolutely condemn even the question itself. We have no perfect idea of any thing but of a perception. A substance is entirely different from a perception. We have, therefore, no idea of a substance. Inhesion in something is suppos'd to be requisite to support the existence of our perceptions. Nothing appears requisite to support the existence of a perception. We have, therefore, no idea of inhesion. What possibility then of answering that question, Whether perceptions inhere in a material or immaterial substance, when we do not so much as understand the meaning of the question?
      <br>&emsp;There is one argument commonly employ'd for the immateriality of the soul, which seems to me remarkable. Whatever is extended consists of parts; and whatever consists of parts is divisible, if not in reality, at least in the imagination. But 'tis impossible any thing divisible can be conjoin'd to a thought or perception, which is a being altogether inseparable and indivisible. For supposing such a conjunction, wou'd the indivisible thought exist on the left or on the right hand of this extended divisible body? On the surface or in the middle? On the back- or fore-side of it? If it be conjoin'd with the extension, it must exist somewhere within its dimensions. If it exist within its dimensions, it must either exist in one particular part; and then that particular part is indivisible, and the perception is conjoin'd only with it, not with the extension: Or if the thought exists in every part, it must also be extended, and separable, and divisible, as well as the body; which is utterly absurd and contradictory. For can any one conceive a passion of a yard in length, a foot in breadth, and an inch in thickness? Thought, therefore, and extension are qualities wholly incompatible, and never can incorporate together into one subject.
      <br>&emsp;This argument affects not the question concerning the substance of the soul, but only that concerning its local conjunction with matter; and therefore it may not be improper to consider in general what objects are, or are not susceptible of a local conjunction. This is a curious question, and may lead us to some discoveries of considerable moment.
      <br>&emsp;The first notion of space and extension is deriv'd solely from the senses of sight and feeling; nor is there any thing, but what is colour'd or tangible, that has parts dispos'd after such a manner, as to convey that idea. When we diminish or encrease a relish, 'tis not after the same manner that we diminish or increase any visible object; and when several sounds strike our hearing at once, custom and reflection alone make us form an idea of the degrees of the distance and contiguity of those bodies, from which they are deriv'd. Whatever marks the place of its existence either must be extended, or must be a mathematical point, without parts or composition. What is extended must have a particular figure, as square, round, triangular; none of which will agree to a desire, or indeed to any impression or idea, except of these two senses above-mention'd. Neither ought a desire, tho' indivisible, to be consider'd as a mathematical point. For in that case 'twou'd be possible, by the addition of others, to make two, three, four desires, and these dispos'd and situated in such a manner, as to have a determinate length, breadth and thickness; which is evidently absurd.
      <br>&emsp;'Twill not be surprizing after this, if I deliver a maxim, which is condemn'd by several metaphysicians, and is esteem'd contrary to the most certain principles of human reason. This maxim is that an object may exist, and yet be no where: and I assert, that this is not only possible, but that the greatest part of beings do and must exist after this manner. An object may be said to be no where, when its parts are not so situated with respect to each other, as to form any figure or quantity; nor the whole with respect to other bodies so as to answer to our notions of contiguity or distance. Now this is evidently the case with all our perceptions and objects, except those of the sight and feeling. A moral reflection cannot be plac'd on the right or on the left hand of a passion, nor can a smell or sound be either of a circular or a square figure. These objects and perceptions, so far from requiring any particular place, are absolutely incompatible with it, and even the imagination cannot attribute it to them. And as to the absurdity of supposing them to be no where, we may consider, that if the passions and sentiments appear to the perception to have any particular place, the idea of extension might be deriv'd from them, as well as from the sight and touch; contrary to what we have already establish'd. If they appear not to have any particular place, they may possibly exist in the same manner; since whatever we conceive is possible.
      <br>&emsp;'Twill not now be necessary to prove, that those perceptions, which are simple, and exist no where, are incapable of any conjunction in place with matter or body, which is extended and divisible; since 'tis impossible to found a relation but on some common quality. It may be better worth our while to remark, that this question of the local conjunction of objects does not only occur in metaphysical disputes concerning the nature of the soul, but that even in common life we have every moment occasion to examine it. Thus supposing we consider a fig at one end of the table, and an olive at the other, 'tis evident, that in forming the complex ideas of these substances, one of the most obvious is that of their different relishes; and 'tis as evident, that we incorporate and conjoin these qualities with such as are colour'd and tangible. The bitter taste of the one, and sweet of the other are suppos'd to lie in the very visible body, and to be separated from each other by the whole length of the table. This is so notable and so natural an illusion, that it may be proper to consider the principles, from which it is deriv'd.
      <br>&emsp;Tho' an extended object be incapable of a conjunction in place with another, that exists without any place or extension, yet are they susceptible of many other relations. Thus the taste and smell of any fruit are inseparable from its other qualities of colour and tangibility; and which-ever of them be the cause or effect, 'tis certain they are always co-existent. Nor are they only co-existent in general, but also co-temporary in their appearance in the mind; and 'tis upon the application of the extended body to our senses we perceive its particular taste and smell. These relations, then, of causation, and contiguity in the time of their appearance, betwixt the extended object and the quality, which exists without any particular place, must have such an effect on the mind, that upon the appearance of one it will immediately turn its thought to the conception of the other. Nor is this all. We not only turn our thought from one to the other upon account of their relation, but likewise endeavour to give them a new relation, viz. that of a conjunction in place, that we may render the transition more easy and natural. For 'tis a quality, which I shall often have occasion to remark in human nature, and shall explain more fully in its proper place, that when objects are united by any relation, we have a strong propensity to add some new relation to them, in order to compleat the union. In our arrangement of bodies we never fail to place such as are resembling, in contiguity to each other, or at least in correspondent points of view: Why? but because we feel a satisfaction in joining the relation of contiguity to that of resemblance, or the resemblance of situation to that of qualities. The effects of this propensity have been already observ'd in that resemblance, which we so readily suppose betwixt particular impressions and their external causes. But we shall not find a more evident effect of it, than in the present instance, where from the relations of causation and contiguity in time betwixt two objects, we feign likewise that of a conjunction in place, in order to strengthen the connexion.
      <br>&emsp;But whatever confus'd notions we may form of an union in place betwixt an extended body, as a fig, and its particular taste, 'tis certain that upon reflection we must observe in this union something altogether unintelligible and contradictory. For shou'd we ask ourselves one obvious question, viz. if the taste, which we conceive to be contain'd in the circumference of the body, is in every part of it or in one only, we must quickly find ourselves at a loss, and perceive the impossibility of ever giving a satisfactory answer. We cannot reply, that 'tis only in one part: For experience convinces us, that every part has the same relish. We can as little reply, that it exists in every part: For then we must suppose it figur'd and extended; which is absurd and incomprehensible. Here then we are influenc'd by two principles directly contrary to each other, viz. that inclination of our fancy by which we are determin'd to incorporate the taste with the extended object, and our reason, which shows us the impossibility of such an union. Being divided betwixt these opposite principles, we renounce neither one nor the other, but involve the subject in such confusion and obscurity, that we no longer perceive the opposition. We suppose, that the taste exists within the circumference of the body, but in such a manner, that it fills the whole without extension, and exists entire in every part without separation. In short, we use in our most familiar way of thinking, that scholastic principle, which, when crudely propos'd, appears so shocking, of totum in toto & totum in qualibet parte: Which is much the same, as if we shou'd say, that a thing is in a certain place, and yet is not there.
      <br>&emsp;All this absurdity proceeds from our endeavouring to bestow a place on what is utterly incapable of it; and that endeavour again arises from our inclination to compleat an union, which is founded on causation, and a contiguity of time, by attributing to the objects a conjunction in place. But if ever reason be of sufficient force to overcome prejudice; 'tis certain, that in the present case it must prevail. For we have only this choice left, either to suppose that some beings exist without any place; or that they are figur'd and extended; or that when they are incorporated with extended objects, the whole is in the whole, and the whole in every part. The absurdity of the two last suppositions proves sufficiently the veracity of the first. Nor is there any fourth opinion. For as to the supposition of their existence in the manner of mathematical points, it resolves itself into the second opinion, and supposes, that several passions may be plac'd in a circular figure, and that a certain number of smells, conjoin'd with a certain number of sounds, may make a body of twelve cubic inches; which appears ridiculous upon the bare mentioning of it.
      <br>&emsp;But tho' in this view of things we cannot refuse to condemn the materialists, who conjoin all thought with extension; yet a little reflection will show us equal reason for blaming their antagonists, who conjoin all thought with a simple and indivisible substance. The most vulgar philosophy informs us, that no external object can make itself known to the mind immediately, and without the interposition of an image or perception. That table, which just now appears to me, is only a perception, and all its qualities are qualities of a perception. Now the most obvious of all its qualities is extension. The perception consists of parts. These parts are so situated, as to afford us the notion of distance and contiguity; of length, breadth, and thickness. The termination of these three dimensions is what we call figure. This figure is moveable, separable, and divisible. Mobility, and separability are the distinguishing properties of extended objects. And to cut short all disputes, the very idea of extension is copy'd from nothing but an impression, and consequently must perfectly agree to it. To say the idea of extension agrees to any thing, is to say it is extended.
      <br>&emsp;The free-thinker may now triumph in his turn; and having found there are impressions and ideas really extended, may ask his antagonists, how they can incorporate a simple and indivisible subject with an extended perception? All the arguments of Theologians may here be retorted upon them. Is the indivisible subject, or immaterial substance, if you will, on the left or on the right hand of the perception? Is it in this particular part, or in that other? Is it in every part without being extended? Or is it entire in any one part without deserting the rest? 'Tis impossible to give any answer to these questions, but what will both be absurd in itself, and will account for the union of our indivisible perceptions with an extended substance.
      <br>&emsp;This gives me an occasion to take a-new into consideration the question concerning the substance of the soul; and tho' I have condemn'd that question as utterly unintelligible, yet I cannot forbear proposing some farther reflections concerning it. I assert, that the doctrine of the immateriality, simplicity, and indivisibility of a thinking substance is a true atheism, and will serve to justify all those sentiments, for which Spinoza is so universally infamous. From this topic, I hope at least to reap one advantage, that my adversaries will not have any pretext to render the present doctrine odious by their declamations, when they see that they can be so easily retorted on them.
      <br>&emsp;The fundamental principle of the atheism of Spinoza is the doctrine of the simplicity of the universe, and the unity of that substance, in which he supposes both thought and matter to inhere. There is only one substance, says he, in the world; and that substance is perfectly simple and indivisible, and exists every where, without any local presence. Whatever we discover externally by sensation; whatever we feel internally by reflection; all these are nothing but modifications of that one, simple, and necessarily existent being, and are not possest of any separate or distinct existence. Every passion of the soul; every configuration of matter, however different and various, inhere in the same substance, and preserve in themselves their characters of distinction, without communicating them to that subject, in which they inhere. The same substratum, if I may so speak, supports the most different modifications, without any difference in itself; and varies them, without any variation. Neither time, nor place, nor all the diversity of nature are able to produce any composition or change in its perfect simplicity and identity.
      <br>&emsp;I believe this brief exposition of the principles of that famous atheist will be sufficient for the present purpose, and that without entering farther into these gloomy and obscure regions, I shall be able to shew, that this hideous hypothesis is almost the same with that of the immateriality of the soul, which has become so popular. To make this evident, let us remember, that as every idea is deriv'd from a preceding perception, 'tis impossible our idea of a perception, and that of an object or external existence can ever represent what are specifically different from each other. Whatever difference we may suppose betwixt them, 'tis still incomprehensible to us; and we are oblig'd either to conceive an external object merely as a relation without a relative, or to make it the very same with a perception or impression.
      <br>&emsp;The consequence I shall draw from this may, at first sight, appear a mere sophism; but upon the least examination will be found solid and satisfactory. I say then, that since we may suppose, but never can conceive a specific difference betwixt an object and impression; any conclusion we form concerning the connexion and repugnance of impressions, will not be known certainly to be applicable to objects; but that on the other hand, whatever conclusions of this kind we form concerning objects, will most certainly be applicable to impressions. The reason is not difficult. As an object is suppos'd to be different from an impression, we cannot be sure, that the circumstance, upon which we found our reasoning, is common to both, supposing we form the reasoning upon the impression. 'Tis still possible, that the object may differ from it in that particular. But when we first form our reasoning concerning the object, 'tis beyond doubt, that the same reasoning must extend to the impression: And that because the quality of the object, upon which the argument is founded, must at least be conceiv'd by the mind; and cou'd not be conceiv'd, unless it were common to an impression; since we have no idea but what is deriv'd from that origin. Thus we may establish it as a certain maxim, that we can never, by any principle, but by an irregular kind of reasoning from experience, discover a connexion or repugnance betwixt objects, which extends not to impressions; tho' the inverse proposition may not be equally true, that all the discoverable relations of impressions are common to objects.
      <br>&emsp;To apply this to the present case; there are two different systems of beings presented, to which I suppose myself under a necessity of assigning some substance, or ground of inhesion. I observe first the universe of objects or of body: The sun, moon and stars; the earth, seas, plants, animals, men, ships, houses, and other productions either of art or nature. Here Spinoza appears, and tells me, that these are only modifications; and that the subject, in which they inhere, is simple, incompounded, and indivisible. After this I consider the other system of beings, viz. the universe of thought, or my impressions and ideas. There I observe another sun, moon and stars; an earth, and seas, cover'd and inhabited by plants and animals; towns, houses, mountains, rivers; and in short every thing I can discover or conceive in the first system. Upon my enquiring concerning these, Theologians present themselves, and tell me, that these also are modifications, and modifications of one simple, uncompounded, and indivisible substance. Immediately upon which I am deafen'd with the noise of a hundred voices, that treat the first hypothesis with detestation and scorn, and the second with applause and veneration. I turn my attention to these hypotheses to see what may be the reason of so great a partiality; and find that they have the same fault of being unintelligible, and that as far as we can understand them, they are so much alike, that 'tis impossible to discover any absurdity in one, which is not common to both of them. We have no idea of any quality in an object, which does not agree to, and may not represent a quality in an impression; and that because all our ideas are deriv'd from our impressions. We can never, therefore, find any repugnance betwixt an extended object as a modification, and a simple uncompounded essence, as its substance, unless that repugnance takes place equally betwixt the perception or impression of that extended object, and the same uncompounded essence. Every idea of a quality in an object passes thro' an impression; and therefore every perceivable relation, whether of connexion or repugnance, must be common both to objects and impressions.
      <br>&emsp;But tho' this argument, consider'd in general, seems evident beyond all doubt and contradiction, yet to make it more clear and sensible, let us survey it in detail; and see whether all the absurdities, which have been found in the system of Spinoza, may not likewise be discover'd in that of Theologians.
      <br>&emsp;First, It has been said against Spinoza, according to the scholastic way of talking, rather than thinking, that a mode, not being any distinct or separate existence, must be the very same with its substance, and consequently the extension of the universe, must be in a manner identify'd with that simple, uncompounded essence, in which the universe is suppos'd to inhere. But this, it may be pretended, is utterly impossible and inconceivable unless the indivisible substance expand itself, so as to correspond to the extension, or the extension contract itself, so as to answer to the indivisible substance. This argument seems just, as far as we can understand it; and 'tis plain nothing is requir'd, but a change in the terms, to apply the same argument to our extended perceptions, and the simple essence of the soul; the ideas of objects and perceptions being in every respect the same, only attended with the supposition of a difference, that is unknown and incomprehensible.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly, It has been said, that we have no idea of substance, which is not applicable to matter; nor any idea of a distinct substance, which is not applicable to every distinct portion of matter. Matter, therefore, is not a mode but a substance, and each part of matter is not a distinct mode, but a distinct substance. I have already prov'd, that we have no perfect idea of substance; but that taking it for something, that can exist by itself, 'tis evident every perception is a substance, and every distinct part of a perception a distinct substance: And consequently the one hypothesis labours under the same difficulties in this respect with the other.
      <br>&emsp;Thirdly, It has been objected to the system of one simple substance in the universe, that this substance being the support or substratum of every thing, must at the very same instant be modify'd into forms, which are contrary and incompatible. The round and square figures are incompatible in the same substance at the same time. How then is it possible, that the same substance can at once be modify'd into that square table, and into this round one? I ask the same question concerning the impressions of these tables; and find that the answer is no more satisfactory in one case than in the other.
      <br>&emsp;It appears, then, that to whatever side we turn, the same difficulties follow us, and that we cannot advance one step towards the establishing the simplicity and immateriality of the soul, without preparing the way for a dangerous and irrecoverable atheism. 'Tis the same case, if instead of calling thought a modification of the soul, we shou'd give it the more antient, and yet more modish name of an action. By an action we mean much the same thing, as what is commonly call'd an abstract mode; that is, something, which, properly speaking, is neither distinguishable, nor separable from its substance, and is only conceiv'd by a distinction of reason, or an abstraction. But nothing is gain'd by this change of the term of modification, for that of action; nor do we free ourselves from one single difficulty by its means; as will appear from the two following reflections.
      <br>&emsp;First, I observe, that the word, action, according to this explication of it, can never justly be apply'd to any perception, as deriv'd from a mind or thinking substance. Our perceptions are all really different, and separable, and distinguishable from each other, and from every thing else, which we can imagine; and therefore 'tis impossible to conceive, how they can be the action or abstract mode of any substance. The instance of motion, which is commonly made use of to shew after what manner perception depends, as an action, upon its substance, rather confounds than instructs us. Motion to all appearance induces no real nor essential change on the body, but only varies its relation to other objects. But betwixt a person in the morning walking in a garden with company, agreeable to him; and a person in the afternoon inclos'd in a dungeon, and full of terror, despair, and resentment, there seems to be a radical difference, and of quite another kind, than what is produc'd on a body by the change of its situation. As we conclude from the distinction and separability of their ideas, that external objects have a separate existence from each other; so when we make these ideas themselves our objects, we must draw the same conclusion concerning them, according to the precedent reasoning. At least it must be confest, that having no idea of the substance of the soul, 'tis impossible for us to tell how it can admit of such differences, and even contrarieties of perception without any fundamental change; and consequently can never tell in what sense perceptions are actions of that substance. The use, therefore, of the word, action, unaccompany'd with any meaning, instead of that of modification, makes no addition to our knowledge, nor is of any advantage to the doctrine of the immateriality of the soul.
      <br>&emsp;I add in the second place, that if it brings any advantage to that cause, it must bring an equal to the cause of atheism. For do our Theologians pretend to make a monopoly of the word, action, and may not the atheists likewise take possession of it, and affirm that plants, animals, men, &c. are nothing but particular actions of one simple universal substance, which exerts itself from a blind and absolute necessity? This you'll say is utterly absurd. I own 'tis unintelligible; but at the same time assert, according to the principles above-explain'd, that 'tis impossible to discover any absurdity in the supposition, that all the various objects in nature are actions of one simple substance, which absurdity will not be applicable to a like supposition concerning impressions and ideas.
      <br>&emsp;From these hypotheses concerning the substance and local conjunction of our perceptions, we may pass to another, which is more intelligible than the former, and more important than the latter, viz. concerning the cause of our perceptions. Matter and motion, 'tis commonly said in the schools, however vary'd, are still matter and motion, and produce only a difference in the position and situation of objects. Divide a body as often as you please, 'tis still body. Place it in any figure, nothing ever results but figure, or the relation of parts. Move it in any manner, you still find motion or a change of relation. 'Tis absurd to imagine, that motion in a circle, for instance, shou'd be nothing but merely motion in a circle; while motion in another direction, as in an ellipse, shou'd also be a passion or moral reflection: That the shocking of two globular particles shou'd become a sensation of pain, and that the meeting of two triangular ones shou'd afford a pleasure. Now as these different shocks, and variations, and mixtures are the only changes, of which matter is susceptible, and as these never afford us any idea of thought or perception, 'tis concluded to be impossible, that thought can ever be caus'd by matter.
      <br>&emsp;Few have been able to withstand the seeming evidence of this argument; and yet nothing in the world is more easy than to refute it. We need only reflect on what has been prov'd at large, that we are never sensible of any connexion betwixt causes and effects, and that 'tis only by our experience of their constant conjunction, we can arrive at any knowledge of this relation. Now as all objects, which are not contrary, are susceptible of a constant conjunction, and as no real objects are contrary; I have inferr'd from these principles, that to consider the matter a priori, any thing may produce any thing, and that we shall never discover a reason, why any object may or may not be the cause of any other, however great, or however little the resemblance may be betwixt them. This evidently destroys the precedent reasoning concerning the cause of thought or perception. For tho' there appear no manner of connexion betwixt motion or thought, the case is the same with all other causes and effects. Place one body of a pound weight on one end of a lever, and another body of the same weight on another end; you will never find in these bodies any principle of motion dependent on their distances from the center, more than of thought and perception. If you pretend, therefore, to prove a priori, that such a position of bodies can never cause thought; because turn it which way you will, 'tis nothing but a position of bodies; you must by the same course of reasoning conclude, that it can never produce motion; since there is no more apparent connexion in the one case than in the other. But as this latter conclusion is contrary to evident experience, and as 'tis possible we may have a like experience in the operations of the mind, and may perceive a constant conjunction of thought and motion; you reason too hastily, when from the mere consideration of the ideas, you conclude that 'tis impossible motion can ever produce thought, or a different position of parts give rise to a different passion or reflection. Nay 'tis not only possible we may have such an experience, but 'tis certain we have it; since every one may perceive, that the different dispositions of his body change his thoughts and sentiments. And shou'd it be said, that this depends on the union of soul and body; I wou'd answer, that we must separate the question concerning the substance of the mind from that concerning the cause of its thought; and that confining ourselves to the latter question we find by the comparing their ideas, that thought and motion are different from each other, and by experience, that they are constantly united; which being all the circumstances, that enter into the idea of cause and effect, when apply'd to the operations of matter, we may certainly conclude, that motion may be, and actually is, the cause of thought and perception.
      <br>&emsp;There seems only this dilemma left us in the present case; either to assert, that nothing can be the cause of another, but where the mind can perceive the connexion in its idea of the objects: Or to maintain, that all objects, which we find constantly conjoin'd, are upon that account to be regarded as causes and effects. If we choose the first part of the dilemma, these are the consequences. First, We in reality affirm, that there is no such thing in the universe as a cause or productive principle, not even the deity himself; since our idea of that supreme Being is deriv'd from particular impressions, none of which contain any efficacy, nor seem to have any connexion with any other existence. As to what may be said, that the connexion betwixt the idea of an infinitely powerful being, and that of any effect, which he wills, is necessary and unavoidable; I answer, that we have no idea of a being endow'd with any power, much less of one endow'd with infinite power. But if we will change expressions, we can only define power by connexion; and then in saying, that the idea of an infinitely powerful being is connected with that of every effect, which he wills, we really do no more than assert, that a being, whose volition is connected with every effect, is connected with every effect; which is an identical proposition, and gives us no insight into the nature of this power or connexion. But, secondly, supposing, that the deity were the great and efficacious principle, which supplies the deficiency of all causes, this leads us into the grossest impieties and absurdities. For upon the same account, that we have recourse to him in natural operations, and assert that matter cannot of itself communicate motion, or produce thought, viz. because there is no apparent connexion betwixt these objects; I say, upon the very same account, we must acknowledge that the deity is the author of all our volitions and perceptions; since they have no more apparent connexion either with one another, or with the suppos'd but unknown substance of the soul. This agency of the supreme Being we know to have been asserted by several philosophers with relation to all the actions of the mind, except volition, or rather an inconsiderable part of volition; tho' 'tis easy to perceive, that this exception is a mere pretext, to avoid the dangerous consequences of that doctrine. If nothing be active but what has an apparent power, thought is in no case any more active than matter; and if this inactivity must make us have recourse to a deity, the supreme being is the real cause of all our actions, bad as well as good, vicious as well as virtuous.
      <br>&emsp;Thus we are necessarily reduc'd to the other side of the dilemma, viz. that all objects, which are found to be constantly conjoin'd, are upon that account only to be regarded as causes and effects. Now as all objects, which are not contrary, are susceptible of a constant conjunction, and as no real objects are contrary; it follows, that for ought we can determine by the mere ideas, any thing may be the cause or effect of any thing; which evidently gives the advantage to the materialists above their antagonists.
      <br>&emsp;To pronounce, then, the final decision upon the whole; the question concerning the substance of the soul is absolutely unintelligible: All our perceptions are not susceptible of a local union, either with what is extended or unextended; there being some of them of the one kind, and some of the other: And as the constant conjunction of objects constitutes the very essence of cause and effect, matter and motion may often be regarded as the causes of thought, as far as we have any notion of that relation.
      <br>&emsp;'Tis certainly a kind of indignity to philosophy, whose sovereign authority ought every where to be acknowledg'd, to oblige her on every occasion to make apologies for her conclusions, and justify herself to every particular art and science, which may be offended at her. This puts one in mind of a king arraign'd for high-treason against his subjects. There is only one occasion, when philosophy will think it necessary and even honourable to justify herself, and that is, when religion may seem to be in the least offended; whose rights are as dear to her as her own, and are indeed the same. If any one, therefore, shou'd imagine that the foregoing arguments are any ways dangerous to religion, I hope the following apology will remove his apprehensions.
      <br>&emsp;There is no foundation for any conclusion a priori, either concerning the operations or duration of any object, of which 'tis possible for the human mind to form a conception. Any object may be imagin'd to become entirely inactive, or to be annihilated in a moment; and 'tis an evident principle, that whatever we can imagine, is possible. Now this is no more true of matter, than of spirit; of an extended compounded substance, than of a simple and unextended. In both cases the metaphysical arguments for the immortality of the soul are equally inconclusive; and in both cases the moral arguments and those deriv'd from the analogy of nature are equally strong and convincing. If my philosophy, therefore, makes no addition to the arguments for religion, I have at least the satisfaction to think it takes nothing from them, but that every thing remains precisely as before.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="ersonalidentity">
      There are some philosophers, who imagine we are every moment intimately conscious of what we call our Self; that we feel its existence and its continuance in existence; and are certain, beyond the evidence of a demonstration, both of its perfect identity and simplicity. The strongest sensation, the most violent passion, say they, instead of distracting us from this view, only fix it the more intensely, and make us consider their influence on self either by their pain or pleasure. To attempt a farther proof of this were to weaken its evidence; since no proof can be deriv'd from any fact, of which we are so intimately conscious; nor is there any thing, of which we can be certain, if we doubt of this.
      <br>&emsp;Unluckily all these positive assertions are contrary to that very experience, which is pleaded for them, nor have we any idea of self, after the manner it is here explain'd. For from what impression cou'd this idea be deriv'd? This question 'tis impossible to answer without a manifest contradiction and absurdity; and yet 'tis a question, which must necessarily be answer'd, if we wou'd have the idea of self pass for clear and intelligible. It must be some one impression, that gives rise to every real idea. But self or person is not any one impression, but that to which our several impressions and ideas are suppos'd to have a reference. If any impression gives rise to the idea of self, that impression must continue invariably the same, thro' the whole course of our lives; since self is suppos'd to exist after that manner. But there is no impression constant and invariable. Pain and pleasure, grief and joy, passions and sensations succeed each other, and never all exist at the same time. It cannot, therefore, be from any of these impressions, or from any other, that the idea of self is deriv'd; and consequently there is no such idea.
      <br>&emsp;But farther, what must become of all our particular perceptions upon this hypothesis? All these are different, and distinguishable, and separable from each other, and may be separately consider'd, and may exist separately, and have no need of any thing to support their existence. After what manner, therefore, do they belong to self; and how are they connected with it? For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of myself, and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions remov'd by death, and cou'd I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I shou'd be entirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If any one upon serious and unprejudic'd reflection, thinks he has a different notion of himself, I must confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continu'd, which he calls himself; tho' I am certain there is no such principle in me.
      <br>&emsp;But setting aside some metaphysicians of this kind, I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind, that they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement. Our eyes cannot turn in their sockets without varying our perceptions. Our thought is still more variable than our sight; and all our other senses and faculties contribute to this change; nor is there any single power of the soul, which remains unalterably the same, perhaps for one moment. The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations. There is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different; whatever natural propension we may have to imagine that simplicity and identity. The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most distant notion of the place, where these scenes are represented, or of the materials, of which it is compos'd.
      <br>&emsp;What then gives us so great a propension to ascribe an identity to these successive perceptions, and to suppose ourselves possest of an invariable and uninterrupted existence thro' the whole course of our lives? In order to answer this question, we must distinguish betwixt personal identity, as it regards our thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions or the concern we take in ourselves. The first is our present subject; and to explain it perfectly we must take the matter pretty deep, and account for that identity, which we attribute to plants and animals; there being a great analogy betwixt it, and the identity of a self or person.
      <br>&emsp;We have a distinct idea of an object, that remains invariable and uninterrupted thro' a suppos'd variation of time; and this idea we call that of identity or sameness. We have also a distinct idea of several different objects existing in succession, and connected together by a close relation; and this to an accurate view affords as perfect a notion of diversity, as if there was no manner of relation among the objects. But tho' these two ideas of identity, and a succession of related objects be in themselves perfectly distinct, and even contrary, yet 'tis certain, that in our common way of thinking they are generally confounded with each other. That action of the imagination, by which we consider the uninterrupted and invariable object, and that by which we reflect on the succession of related objects, are almost the same to the feeling, nor is there much more effort of thought requir'd in the latter case than in the former. The relation facilitates the transition of the mind from one object to another, and renders its passage as smooth as if it contemplated one continu'd object. This resemblance is the cause of the confusion and mistake, and makes us substitute the notion of identity, instead of that of related objects. However at one instant we may consider the related succession as variable or interrupted, we are sure the next to ascribe to it a perfect identity, and regard it as invariable and uninterrupted. Our propensity to this mistake is so great from the resemblance above-mention'd, that we fall into it before we are aware; and tho' we incessantly correct ourselves by reflection, and return to a more accurate method of thinking, yet we cannot long sustain our philosophy, or take off this biass from the imagination. Our last resource is to yield to it, and boldly assert that these different related objects are in effect the same, however interrupted and variable. In order to justify to ourselves this absurdity, we often feign some new and unintelligible principle, that connects the objects together, and prevents their interruption or variation. Thus we feign the continu'd existence of the perceptions of our senses, to remove the interruption; and run into the notion of a soul, and self, and substance, to disguise the variation. But we may farther observe, that where we do not give rise to such a fiction, our propension to confound identity with relation is so great, that we are apt to imagine something unknown and mysterious, connecting the parts, beside their relation; and this I take to be the case with regard to the identity we ascribe to plants and vegetables. And even when this does not take place, we still feel a propensity to confound these ideas, tho' we are not able fully to satisfy ourselves in that particular, nor find any thing invariable and uninterrupted to justify our notion of identity.
      <br>&emsp;Thus the controversy concerning identity is not merely a dispute of words. For when we attribute identity, in an improper sense, to variable or interrupted objects, our mistake is not confin'd to the expression, but is commonly attended with a fiction, either of something invariable and uninterrupted, or of something mysterious and inexplicable, or at least with a propensity to such fictions. What will suffice to prove this hypothesis to the satisfaction of every fair enquirer, is to shew from daily experience and observation, that the objects, which are variable or interrupted, and yet are suppos'd to continue the same, are such only as consist of a succession of parts, connected together by resemblance, contiguity, or causation. For as such a succession answers evidently to our notion of diversity, it can only be by mistake we ascribe to it an identity; and as the relation of parts, which leads us into this mistake, is really nothing but a quality, which produces an association of ideas, and an easy transition of the imagination from one to another, it can only be from the resemblance, which this act of the mind bears to that, by which we contemplate one continu'd object, that the error arises. Our chief business, then, must be to prove, that all objects, to which we ascribe identity, without observing their invariableness and uninterruptedness, are such as consist of a succession of related objects.
      <br>&emsp;In order to this, suppose any mass of matter, of which the parts are contiguous and connected, to be plac'd before us; 'tis plain we must attribute a perfect identity to this mass, provided all the parts continue uninterruptedly and invariably the same, whatever motion or change of place we may observe either in the whole or in any of the parts. But supposing some very small or inconsiderable part to be added to the mass, or substracted from it; tho' this absolutely destroys the identity of the whole, strictly speaking; yet as we seldom think so accurately, we scruple not to pronounce a mass of matter the same, where we find so trivial an alteration. The passage of the thought from the object before the change to the object after it, is so smooth and easy, that we scarce perceive the transition, and are apt to imagine, that 'tis nothing but a continu'd survey of the same object.
      <br>&emsp;There is a very remarkable circumstance, that attends this experiment; which is, that tho' the change of any considerable part in a mass of matter destroys the identity of the whole, yet we must measure the greatness of the part, not absolutely, but by its proportion to the whole. The addition or diminution of a mountain wou'd not be sufficient to produce a diversity in a planet; tho' the change of a very few inches wou'd be able to destroy the identity of some bodies. 'Twill be impossible to account for this, but by reflecting that objects operate upon the mind, and break or interrupt the continuity of its actions not according to their real greatness, but according to their proportion to each other: And therefore, since this interruption makes an object cease to appear the same, it must be the uninterrupted progress of the thought, which constitutes the imperfect identity.
      <br>&emsp;This may be confirm'd by another phænomenon. A change in any considerable part of a body destroys its identity; but 'tis remarkable, that where the change is produc'd gradually and insensibly we are less apt to ascribe to it the same effect. The reason can plainly be no other, than that the mind, in following the successive changes of the body, feels an easy passage from the surveying its condition in one moment to the viewing of it in another, and at no particular time perceives any interruption in its actions. From which continu'd perception, it ascribes a continu'd existence and identity to the object.
      <br>&emsp;But whatever precaution we may use in introducing the changes gradually, and making them proportionable to the whole, 'tis certain, that where the changes are at last observ'd to become considerable, we make a scruple of ascribing identity to such different objects. There is, however, another artifice, by which we may induce the imagination to advance a step farther; and that is, by producing a reference of the parts to each other, and a combination to some common end or purpose. A ship, of which a considerable part has been chang'd by frequent reparations, is still consider'd as the same; nor does the difference of the materials hinder us from ascribing an identity to it. The common end, in which the parts conspire, is the same under all their variations, and affords an easy transition of the imagination from one situation of the body to another.
      <br>&emsp;But this is still more remarkable, when we add a sympathy of parts to their common end, and suppose that they bear to each other, the reciprocal relation of cause and effect in all their actions and operations. This is the case with all animals and vegetables; where not only the several parts have a reference to some general purpose, but also a mutual dependance on, and connexion with each other. The effect of so strong a relation is, that tho' every one must allow, that in a very few years both vegetables and animals endure a total change, yet we still attribute identity to them, while their form, size, and substance are entirely alter'd. An oak, that grows from a small plant to a large tree, is still the same oak; tho' there be not one particle of matter, or figure of its parts the same. An infant becomes a man, and is sometimes fat, sometimes lean, without any change in his identity.
      <br>&emsp;We may also consider the two following phænomena, which are remarkable in their kind. The first is, that tho' we commonly be able to distinguish pretty exactly betwixt numerical and specific identity, yet it sometimes happens, that we confound them, and in our thinking and reasoning employ the one for the other. Thus a man, who hears a noise, that is frequently interrupted and renew'd, says, it is still the same noise; tho' 'tis evident the sounds have only a specific identity or resemblance, and there is nothing numerically the same, but the cause, which produc'd them. In like manner it may be said without breach of the propriety of language, that such a church, which was formerly of brick, fell to ruin, and that the parish rebuilt the same church of free-stone, and according to modern architecture. Here neither the form nor materials are the same, nor is there any thing common to the two objects, but their relation to the inhabitants of the parish; and yet this alone is sufficient to make us denominate them the same. But we must observe, that in these cases the first object is in a manner annihilated before the second comes into existence; by which means, we are never presented in any one point of time with the idea of difference and multiplicity; and for that reason are less scrupulous in calling them the same.
      <br>&emsp;Secondly, We may remark, that tho' in a succession of related objects, it be in a manner requisite, that the change of parts be not sudden nor entire, in order to preserve the identity, yet where the objects are in their nature changeable and inconstant, we admit of a more sudden transition, than wou'd otherwise be consistent with that relation. Thus as the nature of a river consists in the motion and change of parts; tho' in less than four and twenty hours these be totally alter'd; this hinders not the river from continuing the same during several ages. What is natural and essential to any thing is, in a manner, expected; and what is expected makes less impression, and appears of less moment, than what is unusual and extraordinary. A considerable change of the former kind seems really less to the imagination, than the most trivial alteration of the latter; and by breaking less the continuity of the thought, has less influence in destroying the identity.
      <br>&emsp;We now proceed to explain the nature of personal identity, which has become so great a question in philosophy, especially of late years in England, where all the abstruser sciences are study'd with a peculiar ardour and application. And here 'tis evident, the same method of reasoning must be continu'd, which has so successfully explain'd the identity of plants, and animals, and ships, and houses, and of all the compounded and changeable productions either of art or nature. The identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to vegetables and animal bodies. It cannot, therefore, have a different origin, but must proceed from a like operation of the imagination upon like objects.
      <br>&emsp;But lest this argument shou'd not convince the reader; tho'; in my opinion perfectly decisive; let him weigh the following reasoning, which is still closer and more immediate. 'Tis evident, that the identity, which we attribute to the human mind, however perfect we may imagine it to be, is not able to run the several different perceptions into one, and make them lose their characters of distinction and difference, which are essential to them. 'Tis still true, that every distinct perception, which enters into the composition of the mind, is a distinct existence, and is different, and distinguishable, and separable from every other perception, either contemporary or successive. But, as, notwithstanding this distinction and separability, we suppose the whole train of perceptions to be united by identity, a question naturally arises concerning this relation of identity; whether it be something that really binds our several perceptions together, or only associates their ideas in the imagination. That is, in other words, whether in pronouncing concerning the identity of a person, we observe some real bond among his perceptions, or only feel one among the ideas we form of them. This question we might easily decide, if we wou'd recollect what has been already prov'd at large, that the understanding never observes any real connexion among objects, and that even the union of cause and effect, when strictly examin'd, resolves itself into a customary association of ideas. For from thence it evidently follows, that identity is nothing really belonging to these different perceptions, and uniting them together; but is merely a quality, which we attribute to them, because of the union of their ideas in the imagination, when we reflect upon them. Now the only qualities, which can give ideas an union in the imagination, are these three relations above-mention'd. These are the uniting principles in the ideal world, and without them every distinct object is separable by the mind, and may be separately consider'd, and appears not to have any more connexion with any other object, than if disjoin'd by the greatest difference and remoteness. 'Tis, therefore, on some of these three relations of resemblance, contiguity and causation, that identity depends; and as the very essence of these relations consists in their producing an easy transition of ideas; it follows, that our notions of personal identity, proceed entirely from the smooth and uninterrupted progress of the thought along a train of connected ideas, according to the principles above-explain'd.
      <br>&emsp;The only question, therefore, which remains, is, by what relations this uninterrupted progress of our thought is produc'd, when we consider the successive existence of a mind or thinking person. And here 'tis evident we must confine ourselves to resemblance and causation, and must drop contiguity, which has little or no influence in the present case.
      <br>&emsp;To begin with resemblance; suppose we cou'd see clearly into the breast of another, and observe that succession of perceptions, which constitutes his mind or thinking principle, and suppose that he always preserves the memory of a considerable part of past perceptions; 'tis evident that nothing cou'd more contribute to the bestowing a relation on this succession amidst all its variations. For what is the memory but a faculty, by which we raise up the images of past perceptions? And as an image necessarily resembles its object, must not the frequent placing of these resembling perceptions in the chain of thought, convey the imagination more easily from one link to another, and make the whole seem like the continuance of one object? In this particular, then, the memory not only discovers the identity, but also contributes to its production, by producing the relation of resemblance among the perceptions. The case is the same whether we consider ourselves or others.
      <br>&emsp;As to causation; we may observe, that the true idea of the human mind, is to consider it as a system of different perceptions or different existences, which are link'd together by the relation of cause and effect, and mutually produce, destroy, influence, and modify each other. Our impressions give rise to their correspondent ideas; and these ideas in their turn produce other impressions. One thought chaces another, and draws after it a third, by which it is expell'd in its turn. In this respect, I cannot compare the soul more properly to any thing than to a republic or commonwealth, in which the several members are united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination, and give rise to other persons, who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts. And as the same individual republic may not only change its members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the same person may vary his character and disposition, as well as his impressions and ideas, without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his several parts are still connected by the relation of causation. And in this view our identity with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with regard to the imagination, by the making our distant perceptions influence each other, and by giving us a present concern for our past or future pains or pleasures.
      <br>&emsp;As memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be consider'd, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd have any notion of causation, nor consequently of that chain of causes and effects, which constitute our self or person. But having once acquir'd this notion of causation from the memory, we can extend the same chain of causes, and consequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory, and can comprehend times, and circumstances, and actions, which we have entirely forgot, but suppose in general to have existed. For how few of our past actions are there, of which we have any memory? Who can tell me, for instance, what were his thoughts and actions on the first of January 1715, the 11th of March 1719, and the 3d of August 1733? Or will he affirm, because he has entirely forgot the incidents of these days, that the present self is not the same person with the self of that time; and by that means overturn all the most establish'd notions of personal identity? In this view, therefore, memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions. 'Twill be incumbent on those, who affirm that memory produces entirely our personal identity, to give a reason why we can thus extend our identity beyond our memory.
      <br>&emsp;The whole of this doctrine leads us to a conclusion, which is of great importance in the present affair, viz. that all the nice and subtile questions concerning personal identity can never possibly be decided, and are to be regarded rather as grammatical than as philosophical difficulties. Identity depends on the relations of ideas; and these relations produce identity, by means of that easy transition they occasion. But as the relations, and the easiness of the transition may diminish by insensible degrees, we have no just standard, by which we can decide any dispute concerning the time, when they acquire or lose a title to the name of identity. All the disputes concerning the identity of connected objects are merely verbal, except so far as the relation of parts gives rise to some fiction or imaginary principle of union, as we have already observ'd.
      <br>&emsp;What I have said concerning the first origin and uncertainty of our notion of identity, as apply'd to the human mind, may be extended with little or no variation to that of simplicity. An object, whose different co-existent parts are bound together by a close relation, operates upon the imagination after much the same manner as one perfectly simple and indivisible, and requires not a much greater stretch of thought in order to its conception. From this similarity of operation we attribute a simplicity to it, and feign a principle of union as the support of this simplicity, and the center of all the different parts and qualities of the object.
      <br>&emsp;Thus we have finish'd our examination of the several systems of philosophy, both of the intellectual and natural world; and in our miscellaneous way of reasoning have been led into several topics; which will either illustrate and confirm some preceding part of this discourse, or prepare the way for our following opinions. 'Tis now time to return to a more close examination of our subject, and to proceed in the accurate anatomy of human nature, having fully explain'd the nature of our judgment and understanding.

      <div class="content-text hidden"id="Conclusion">
      But before I launch out into those immense depths of philosophy, which lie before me, I find myself inclin'd to stop a moment in my present station, and to ponder that voyage, which I have undertaken, and which undoubtedly requires the utmost art and industry to be brought to a happy conclusion. Methinks I am like a man, who having struck on many shoals, and having narrowly escap'd ship-wreck in passing a small frith, has yet the temerity to put out to sea in the same leaky weather-beaten vessel, and even carries his ambition so far as to think of compassing the globe under these disadvantageous circumstances. My memory of past errors and perplexities, makes me diffident for the future. The wretched condition, weakness, and disorder of the faculties, I must employ in my enquiries, encrease my apprehensions. And the impossibility of amending or correcting these faculties, reduces me almost to despair, and makes me resolve to perish on the barren rock, on which I am at present, rather than venture myself upon that boundless ocean, which runs out into immensity. This sudden view of my danger strikes me with melancholy; and as 'tis usual for that passion, above all others, to indulge itself; I cannot forbear feeding my despair, with all those desponding reflections, which the present subject furnishes me with in such abundance.
      <br>&emsp;I am first affrighted and confounded with that forelorn solitude, in which I am plac'd in my philosophy, and fancy myself some strange uncouth monster, who not being able to mingle and unite in society, has been expell'd all human commerce, and left utterly abandon'd and disconsolate. Fain wou'd I run into the crowd for shelter and warmth; but cannot prevail with myself to mix with such deformity. I call upon others to join me, in order to make a company apart; but no one will hearken to me. Every one keeps at a distance, and dreads that storm, which beats upon me from every side. I have expos'd myself to the enmity of all metaphysicians, logicians, mathematicians, and even theologians; and can I wonder at the insults I must suffer? I have declar'd my disapprobation of their systems; and can I be surpriz'd, if they shou'd express a hatred of mine and of my person? When I look abroad, I foresee on every side, dispute, contradiction, anger, calumny and detraction. When I turn my eye inward, I find nothing but doubt and ignorance. All the world conspires to oppose and contradict me; tho' such is my weakness, that I feel all my opinions loosen and fall of themselves, when unsupported by the approbation of others. Every step I take is with hesitation, and every new reflection makes me dread an error and absurdity in my reasoning.
      <br>&emsp;For with what confidence can I venture upon such bold enterprizes, when beside those numberless infirmities peculiar to myself, I find so many which are common to human nature? Can I be sure, that in leaving all establish'd opinions I am following truth; and by what criterion shall I distinguish her, even if fortune shou'd at last guide me on her foot-steps? After the most accurate and exact of my reasonings, I can give no reason why I shou'd assent to it; and feel nothing but a strong propensity to consider objects strongly in that view, under which they appear to me. Experience is a principle, which instructs me in the several conjunctions of objects for the past. Habit is another principle, which determines me to expect the same for the future; and both of them conspiring to operate upon the imagination, make me form certain ideas in a more intense and lively manner, than others, which are not attended with the same advantages. Without this quality, by which the mind enlivens some ideas beyond others (which seemingly is so trivial, and so little founded on reason) we cou'd never assent to any argument, nor carry our view beyond those few objects, which are present to our senses. Nay, even to these objects we cou'd never attribute any existence, but what was dependent on the senses; and must comprehend them entirely in that succession of perceptions, which constitutes our self or person. Nay farther, even with relation to that succession, we cou'd only admit of those perceptions, which are immediately present to our consciousness, nor cou'd those lively images, with which the memory presents us, be ever receiv'd as true pictures of past perceptions. The memory, senses, and understanding are, therefore, all of them founded on the imagination, or the vivacity of our ideas.
      <br>&emsp;No wonder a principle so inconstant and fallacious shou'd lead us into errors, when implicitely follow'd (as it must be) in all its variations. 'Tis this principle, which makes us reason from causes and effects; and 'tis the same principle, which convinces us of the continu'd existence of external objects, when absent from the senses. But tho' these two operations be equally natural and necessary in the human mind, yet in some circumstances they are directly contrary, nor is it possible for us to reason justly and regularly from causes and effects, and at the same time believe the continu'd existence of matter. How then shall we adjust those principles together? Which of them shall we prefer? Or in case we prefer neither of them, but successively assent to both, as is usual among philosophers, with what confidence can we afterwards usurp that glorious title, when we thus knowingly embrace a manifest contradiction?
      <br>&emsp;This contradiction wou'd be more excusable, were it compensated by any degree of solidity and satisfaction in the other parts of our reasoning. But the case is quite contrary. When we trace up the human understanding to its first principles, we find it to lead us into such sentiments, as seem to turn into ridicule all our past pains and industry, and to discourage us from future enquiries. Nothing is more curiously enquir'd after by the mind of man, than the causes of every phænomenon; nor are we content with knowing the immediate causes, but push on our enquiries, till we arrive at the original and ultimate principle. We wou'd not willingly stop before we are acquainted with that energy in the cause, by which it operates on its effect; that tie, which connects them together; and that efficacious quality, on which the tie depends. This is our aim in all our studies and reflections: And how must we be disappointed, when we learn, that this connexion, tie, or energy lies merely in ourselves, and is nothing but that determination of the mind, which is acquir'd by custom, and causes us to make a transition from an object to its usual attendant, and from the impression of one to the lively idea of the other? Such a discovery not only cuts off all hope of ever attaining satisfaction, but even prevents our very wishes; since it appears, that when we say we desire to know the ultimate and operating principle, as something, which resides in the external object, we either contradict ourselves, or talk without a meaning.
      <br>&emsp;This deficiency in our ideas is not, indeed, perceiv'd in common life, nor are we sensible, that in the most usual conjunctions of cause and effect we are as ignorant of the ultimate principle, which binds them together, as in the most unusual and extraordinary. But this proceeds merely from an illusion of the imagination; and the question is, how far we ought to yield to these illusions. This question is very difficult, and reduces us to a very dangerous dilemma, which-ever way we answer it. For if we assent to every trivial suggestion of the fancy; beside that these suggestions are often contrary to each other; they lead us into such errors, absurdities, and obscurities, that we must at last become asham'd of our credulity. Nothing is more dangerous to reason than the flights of the imagination, and nothing has been the occasion of more mistakes among philosophers. Men of bright fancies may in this respect be compar'd to those angels, whom the scripture represents as covering their eyes with their wings. This has already appear'd in so many instances, that we may spare ourselves the trouble of enlarging upon it any farther.
      <br>&emsp;But on the other hand, if the consideration of these instances makes us take a resolution to reject all the trivial suggestions of the fancy, and adhere to the understanding, that is, to the general and more establish'd properties of the imagination; even this resolution, if steadily executed, wou'd be dangerous, and attended with the most fatal consequences. For I have already shewn, that the understanding, when it acts alone, and according to its most general principles, entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence in any proposition, either in philosophy or common life. We save ourselves from this total scepticism only by means of that singular and seemingly trivial property of the fancy, by which we enter with difficulty into remote views of things, and are not able to accompany them with so sensible an impression, as we do those, which are more easy and natural. Shall we, then, establish it for a general maxim, that no refin'd or elaborate reasoning is ever to be receiv'd? Consider well the consequences of such a principle. By this means you cut off entirely all science and philosophy: You proceed upon one singular quality of the imagination, and by a parity of reason must embrace all of them: And you expresly contradict yourself; since this maxim must be built on the preceding reasoning, which will be allow'd to be sufficiently refin'd and metaphysical. What party, then, shall we choose among these difficulties? If we embrace this principle, and condemn all refin'd reasoning, we run into the most manifest absurdities. If we reject it in favour of these reasonings, we subvert entirely the human understanding. We have, therefore, no choice left but betwixt a false reason and none at all. For my part, I know not what ought to be done in the present case. I can only observe what is commonly done; which is, that this difficulty is seldom or never thought of; and even where it has once been present to the mind, is quickly forgot, and leaves but a small impression behind it. Very refin'd reflections have little or no influence upon us; and yet we do not, and cannot establish it for a rule, that they ought not to have any influence; which implies a manifest contradiction.
      <br>&emsp;But what have I here said, that reflections very refin'd and metaphysical have little or no influence upon us? This opinion I can scarce forbear retracting, and condemning from my present feeling and experience. The intense view of these manifold contradictions and imperfections in human reason has so wrought upon me, and heated my brain, that I am ready to reject all belief and reasoning, and can look upon no opinion even as more probable or likely than another. Where am I, or what? From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return? Whose favour shall I court, and whose anger must I dread? What beings surround me? and on whom have I any influence, or who have any influence on me? I am confounded with all these questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most deplorable condition imaginable, inviron'd with the deepest darkness, and utterly depriv'd of the use of every member and faculty.
      <br>&emsp;Most fortunately it happens, that since reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, nature herself suffices to that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical melancholy and delirium, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. I dine, I play a game of back-gammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends; and when after three or four hour's amusement, I wou'd return to these speculations, they appear so cold, and strain'd, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any farther.
      <br>&emsp;Here then I find myself absolutely and necessarily determin'd to live, and talk, and act like other people in the common affairs of life. But notwithstanding that my natural propensity, and the course of my animal spirits and passions reduce me to this indolent belief in the general maxims of the world, I still feel such remains of my former disposition, that I am ready to throw all my books and papers into the fire, and resolve never more to renounce the pleasures of life for the sake of reasoning and philosophy. For those are my sentiments in that splenetic humour, which governs me at present. I may, nay I must yield to the current of nature, in submitting to my senses and understanding; and in this blind submission I shew most perfectly my sceptical disposition and principles. But does it follow, that I must strive against the current of nature, which leads me to indolence and pleasure; that I must seclude myself, in some measure, from the commerce and society of men, which is so agreeable; and that I must torture my brain with subtilities and sophistries, at the very time that I cannot satisfy myself concerning the reasonableness of so painful an application, nor have any tolerable prospect of arriving by its means at truth and certainty. Under what obligation do I lie of making such an abuse of time? And to what end can it serve either for the service of mankind, or for my own private interest? No: If I must be a fool, as all those who reason or believe any thing certainly are, my follies shall at least be natural and agreeable. Where I strive against my inclination, I shall have a good reason for my resistance; and will no more be led a wandering into such dreary solitudes, and rough passages, as I have hitherto met with.
      <br>&emsp;These are the sentiments of my spleen and indolence; and indeed I must confess, that philosophy has nothing to oppose to them, and expects a victory more from the returns of a serious good-humour'd disposition, than from the force of reason and conviction. In all the incidents of life we ought still to preserve our scepticism. If we believe, that fire warms, or water refreshes, 'tis only because it costs us too much pains to think otherwise. Nay if we are philosophers, it ought only to be upon sceptical principles, and from an inclination, which we feel to the employing ourselves after that manner. Where reason is lively, and mixes itself with some propensity, it ought to be assented to. Where it does not, it never can have any title to operate upon us.
      <br>&emsp;At the time, therefore, that I am tir'd with amusement and company, and have indulg'd a reverie in my chamber, or in a solitary walk by a river-side, I feel my mind all collected within itself, and am naturally inclin'd to carry my view into all those subjects, about which I have met with so many disputes in the course of my reading and conversation. I cannot forbear having a curiosity to be acquainted with the principles of moral good and evil, the nature and foundation of government, and the cause of those several passions and inclinations, which actuate and govern me. I am uneasy to think I approve of one object, and disapprove of another; call one thing beautiful, and another deform'd; decide concerning truth and falshood, reason and folly, without knowing upon what principles I proceed. I am concern'd for the condition of the learned world, which lies under such a deplorable ignorance in all these particulars. I feel an ambition to arise in me of contributing to the instruction of mankind, and of acquiring a name by my inventions and discoveries. These sentiments spring up naturally in my present disposition; and shou'd I endeavour to banish them, by attaching myself to any other business or diversion, I feel I shou'd be a loser in point of pleasure; and this is the origin of my philosophy.
      <br>&emsp;But even suppose this curiosity and ambition shou'd not transport me into speculations without the sphere of common life, it wou'd necessarily happen, that from my very weakness I must be led into such enquiries. 'Tis certain, that superstition is much more bold in its systems and hypotheses than philosophy; and while the latter contents itself with assigning new causes and principles to the phænomena, which appear in the visible world, the former opens a world of its own, and presents us with scenes, and beings, and objects, which are altogether new. Since therefore 'tis almost impossible for the mind of man to rest, like those of beasts, in that narrow circle of objects, which are the subject of daily conversation and action, we ought only to deliberate concerning the choice of our guide, and ought to prefer that which is safest and most agreeable. And in this respect I make bold to recommend philosophy, and shall not scruple to give it the preference to superstition of every kind or denomination. For as superstition arises naturally and easily from the popular opinions of mankind, it seizes more strongly on the mind, and is often able to disturb us in the conduct of our lives and actions. Philosophy on the contrary, if just, can present us only with mild and moderate sentiments; and if false and extravagant, its opinions are merely the objects of a cold and general speculation, and seldom go so far as to interrupt the course of our natural propensities. The Cynics are an extraordinary instance of philosophers, who from reasonings purely philosophical ran into as great extravagancies of conduct as any Monk or Dervise that ever was in the world. Generally speaking, the errors in religion are dangerous; those in philosophy only ridiculous.
      <br>&emsp;I am sensible, that these two cases of the strength and weakness of the mind will not comprehend all mankind, and that there are in England, in particular, many honest gentlemen, who being always employ'd in their domestic affairs, or amusing themselves in common recreations, have carried their thoughts very little beyond those objects, which are every day expos'd to their senses. And indeed, of such as these I pretend not to make philosophers, nor do I expect them either to be associates in these researches or auditors of these discoveries. They do well to keep themselves in their present situation; and instead of refining them into philosophers, I wish we cou'd communicate to our founders of systems, a share of this gross earthy mixture, as an ingredient, which they commonly stand much in need of, and which wou'd serve to temper those fiery particles, of which they are compos'd. While a warm imagination is allow'd to enter into philosophy, and hypotheses embrac'd merely for being specious and agreeable, we can never have any steady principles, nor any sentiments, which will suit with common practice and experience. But were these hypotheses once remov'd, we might hope to establish a system or set of opinions, which if not true (for that, perhaps, is too much to be hop'd for) might at least be satisfactory to the human mind, and might stand the test of the most critical examination. Nor shou'd we despair of attaining this end, because of the many chimerical systems, which have successively arisen and decay'd away among men, wou'd we consider the shortness of that period, wherein these questions have been the subjects of enquiry and reasoning. Two thousand years with such long interruptions, and under such mighty discouragements are a small space of time to give any tolerable perfection to the sciences; and perhaps we are still in too early an age of the world to discover any principles, which will bear the examination of the latest posterity. For my part, my only hope is, that I may contribute a little to the advancement of knowledge, by giving in some particulars a different turn to the speculations of philosophers, and pointing out to them more distinctly those subjects, where alone they can expect assurance and conviction. Human Nature is the only science of man; and yet has been hitherto the most neglected. 'Twill be sufficient for me, if I can bring it a little more into fashion; and the hope of this serves to compose my temper from that spleen, and invigorate it from that indolence, which sometimes prevail upon me. If the reader finds himself in the same easy disposition, let him follow me in my future speculations. If not, let him follow his inclination, and wait the returns of application and good humour. The conduct of a man, who studies philosophy in this careless manner, is more truly sceptical than that of one, who feeling in himself an inclination to it, is yet so over-whelm'd with doubts and scruples, as totally to reject it. A true sceptic will be diffident of his philosophical doubts, as well as of his philosophical conviction; and will never refuse any innocent satisfaction, which offers itself, upon account of either of them.
      <br>&emsp;Nor is it only proper we shou'd in general indulge our inclination in the most elaborate philosophical researches, notwithstanding our sceptical principles, but also that we shou'd yield to that propensity, which inclines us to be positive and certain in particular points, according to the light, in which we survey them in any particular instant. 'Tis easier to forbear all examination and enquiry, than to check ourselves in so natural a propensity, and guard against that assurance, which always arises from an exact and full survey of an object. On such an occasion we are apt not only to forget our scepticism, but even our modesty too; and make use of such terms as these, 'tis evident, 'tis certain, 'tis undeniable; which a due deference to the public ought, perhaps, to prevent. I may have fallen into this fault after the example of others; but I here enter a caveat against any objections, which may be offer'd on that head; and declare that such expressions were extorted from me by the present view of the object, and imply no dogmatical spirit, nor conceited idea of my own judgment, which are sentiments that I am sensible can become no body, and a sceptic still less than any other.

   <div class="content-text hidden" id="OnListening">
      I have written out and sent to you, Nicander, my lecture on how to listen, to help you to know the correct way to listen to anyone who is trying to persuade you, now that you have been released from guardians and have taken on the mantle of manhood. For lack of rules (which the undisciplined sector of the young call freedom)  sets masters over one which are more tyrannical  than the teachers and trainers familiar from childhood – these masters are the desires, when they have broken out of prison, so to speak. Just as, according to Herodotus, women discard their inhibitions along with their clothes, so when some young people shed the mantle of childhood, they simultaneously shed inhibition and caution, and no sooner have they divested themselves of restrictive clothing, than they overflow with self-indulgence.  
      <br>&emsp;You, on the other hand, have often been told that following God and listening to reason are identical; so bear in mind that for intelligent people the passage from childhood to adulthood is not an abandonment of rules, but a change of ruler: instead of someone  whose services are hired and bought, they accept in their lives the divine leadership of reason – and it is only those who follow reason who deserve to be regarded as free. For they alone live as they want, since they have learned to want only what is necessary; but undisciplined and irrational whims and actions signify an inferior caste, and there is little freedom of will in often changing one’s mind.  
      <br>&emsp;Immigrants who are completely new to a country, when they are enrolled into the citizen body, are full of complaints and  grumbles about what goes on, whereas resident aliens have been brought up with and acclimatized to the laws, and they readily accept and acquiesce in events. Your case is precisely analogous: you were brought up for a long time in philosophical surroundings, you were thoroughly acclimatized to every lesson and lecture of your formative years being presented with a dash of philosophic reason, and so it is as your friend and relative that you ought to approach philosophy, which is the only thing that invests young people with the manly, perfect and orderly attire that truly stems from reason.  
      <br>&emsp;I think you will enjoy a preamble about the sense of hearing. Theophrastus describes it as the most emotional of them all, on the grounds that nothing visible or tasteable or touchable brings the degree of distraction, confusion and turmoil which seizes the mind when the hearing is assaulted by crashing, clattering and booming noises of a certain kind. But in fact it is more rational than emotional. Many bodily regions and parts allow vice to enter through them and affect the mind, but virtue has only one  handle – the ears of the young, provided that no flattery has contaminated and corrupted them, and no negative remarks have ever been allowed to fall upon them. That is why Xenocrates suggested that it was children rather than boxers who ought to be equipped with ear protectors: the ears of the latter are marred by blows, but the characters of the former are marred by words. He was not recommending turning a deaf ear or actually being deaf, but he was advising wariness about negative remarks, until other good remarks – picture them as sentinels nurtured by philosophy in one’s character – occupy that part of the character which is particularly unstable and credulous.  
      <br>&emsp;Bias, too, in times long past, was once told to send to Amasis that part of the sacrificial animal which is simultaneously the best and the worst: the tongue was what he extracted and sent, on the grounds that the maximum harm and benefit are inherent in speaking. And it is very common for people, when they kiss  small children, to hold their ears and to tell the children to do this to them too – a light-hearted hint that especial love is due to those who confer benefit through the ears!  
      <br>&emsp;It goes without saying that a young man who is denied all instruction and never tastes any rational discourse not only remains barren and unproductive of virtue, but also might become marred and perverted towards vice, producing plentiful mental weeds from his unturned and unworked soil, as it were. The reason for this lies in the tendency towards pleasure and the tendency to have reservations about hard work, which are not external tendencies implanted by words, but are (so to speak)  native sources of countless pathological conditions: if these tendencies are allowed to roam free along the paths they naturally take, if their nature is not disciplined by using good arguments to eradicate or divert them, then there is no wild beast which would not appear tame compared to a human being.  
      <br>&emsp;Therefore, since both the benefits and the dangers inherent in listening are equally great for young people, I am of the opinion that listening ought to be a constant topic of discussion in one’s own mind and with other people. This is especially so  because it is noticeable that most people go about the matter in the wrong way: they practise speaking before they have got used to listening, and they think that speaking takes study and care, but benefit will accrue from even a careless approach to listening. It may be the case that in ball games learning to throw and learning to catch the ball are simultaneous, but in dealing with speech proper receptivity is prior to delivery, just as conception and pregnancy precede the birth of viable offspring.  
      <br>&emsp;Where birds are concerned, we are told that the bearing and production of wind-eggs is due to impregnation by certain incomplete and lifeless remnants; and the speech of young people who  are incapable of listening and unused to benefiting from listening is truly windy and ‘unremarked, unnoticed, is scattered beneath the clouds’. They can tip and turn their cups to guarantee that whatever is being poured in goes in and to ensure that the liquid really falls into their cups rather than out of their cups, but they have no idea how to make themselves ready for a speaker and how to adapt their attention to the lecture to guarantee that none of the useful things said escapes them.  
      <br>&emsp;But the most ludicrous thing of all is that if they come across anyone with a story to tell about a dinner party or a procession or a dream or a slanging match he had with someone, they listen in silence and cannot get enough. However, if someone attracts their attention and gives them some beneficial instruction or necessary advice, or tells them off for their misdemeanours, or tries to calm their anger, they become impatient and, if they can, they make a contest out of it, resist his words and try to argue him down; if they cannot do that, they leave to find refuge in further vacuous conversation, filling their ears, as they would mean and faulty cups, with anything as long as it is trivial.  
      <br>&emsp;Good trainers turn out horses with mouths amenable to the bit, and children with ears amenable to speech, by teaching them to listen a lot but speak little. The compliment Spintharus paid to Epaminondas is relevant in this context: he said that it was hard to meet anyone who knew more or spoke less. And it is said that Nature gave each of us two ears, but one tongue, because we should listen more than we speak.  
      <br>&emsp;There are, in short, no exceptions to the rule that for a young man silence is undoubtedly an adornment; and never more so than if he listens to someone else without getting worked up and barking out a riposte but – even if the comments are  distinctly unwelcome – puts up with them and waits for the speaker to finish and, once the speaker has finished, instead of immediately answering back, leaves an interval, as Aeschines says, to see if the speaker wants to add anything to what he has already said, or to make any changes or take something back. Immediately to lash out in retaliation, however, and neither to listen nor be listened to, but to speak while being spoken to, is scandalous; on the other hand, anyone who has acquired the ability to listen in a self-controlled and respectful fashion is receptive to and retentive of any remarks that are useful, while any that are useless or false are quite transparent to him and easily detectable, because he is – as is obvious – aiming at the truth  rather than at winning an argument, and does not pitch in head first for a fight. In this context, there is a valuable saying one occasionally comes across – that those who want to instil something useful should concentrate less on deflating wineskins and more on deflating the pretensions and affectations of young people; without this, young people are full of self-important hot air, and cannot be receptive.  
      <br>&emsp;It goes without saying that the presence of the vitriolic and malignant form of envy does no good to anything anyone does, and is an obstacle to all fine actions; but there is nowhere it is a worse colleague and adviser than in listening: there is nothing less pleasant to an envious person than others speaking well, so envy makes them hear anything beneficial as horrible and disagree  able and unwelcome. Envy, however, is all that someone who is irritated at other people’s affluence or standing or good looks suffers from, since it is others’ good fortune which annoys him; someone who is exasperated by good speaking, however, resents what is to his own advantage. For just as light is a good thing for those who can see, so speech is for those who can hear, if they are prepared to be receptive. 
      <br>&emsp;Leaving aside the various undisciplined and faulty mental conditions which make people envious in other respects, envy which is directed at speakers is generated by inopportune and unjustified desire for standing or for recognition, and it discomposes and  scatters the mind of anyone who is influenced by these conditions, and so prevents him from attending to what is being said. One part of his mind is surveying its own state to see if the speaker’s mind is better; another part is looking at the rest of the audience to see if they are admiring or impressed by the speaker. If their reaction is favourable, his mind becomes upset by their approval and the audience becomes the target of his annoyance. His mind fails to retain and preserve that part of the lecture that has already been delivered, because the memory of it distresses him, and is agitated and worried in case the rest of the lecture turns out to be better than what has gone before. The more excellent the speakers, the more quickly his mind urges them to finish, and [0A] when the lecture has ended, his mind does not dwell on any of the points that were made, but takes stock of the audience’s comments and attitudes as if they were registering votes. It backs and shies away from those whose comments are favourable as if they were insane,* but pursues and fraternizes with the speeches’ detractors, who try to distort what was said; if distortion is out of the question, it uses comparison to claim that others have addressed the same issues better and more capably. The result is that it ruins and violates the lectures, and makes them void of any purpose or benefit they might have had for it.       
      <br>&emsp;This is why it is essential for one to call a halt to the conflict between the desire for instruction and the desire for standing, and to listen to the speaker in a gracious and civilized manner, as if one had been invited to a festival banquet or the opening of a ritual. When the speaker hits the mark, one should acclaim his skill; and one should applaud at least his intention in making public what he knows and in using the arguments he himself has found convincing to try to persuade others. When he does well, we should realize that this is no lucky or random success, but is due to diligence, hard work and study – and such success certainly deserves our admiration and aspiration, and we should reproduce it in ourselves. When he does not do well, however, we must concentrate on the reasons and causes of the error: just  as, as Xenophon says, estate-managers gain from both friends and enemies, so people whose attention is alert and focused benefit from both success and its lack in speaking. Sloppy thinking, hollow phrases, cheap figures of speech, excited and tasteless delight in seeking applause, and so on, are more obvious in others when we are listening than in ourselves when we are speaking, so we ought to transfer our scrutiny from the speaker to ourselves, and ask ourselves whether we make the same mistakes without noticing them. There is nothing easier than criticizing  one’s neighbour, but we might share the same faults, and such criticism is useless and vain if it fails to lead to any improvement or vigilance in these respects. When faced with people making mistakes, one should not balk at constantly repeating to oneself Plato’s saying: ‘Am I really sure that I’m not like that too? ‘ For just as we see our own eyes reflected in the eyes of our neighbours, so where speaking is concerned it is inevitable that our own mannerisms are mirrored by those of others, and this should stop us rushing headlong into contempt of others, and make us pay closer attention to ourselves when we speak.        
      <br>&emsp;In this context, there is benefit to be derived even from the practice of comparison: when we have left the lecture and are on our own, we can take something which we think the speaker coped with poorly or inadequately, and make an attempt at the same thing, and put ourselves in the position of trying to remedy, as it were, deficiency x, or to correct fault y, or to express z in a different way, or to contribute to the topic in a thoroughly novel fashion (which is what Plato did with regard to Lysias’ speech). It is not difficult – in fact, it is really quite easy – to repudiate a speech once it has been delivered; but it is extremely hard work to raise an improved version instead: as the Spartan said, at the news that Philip had levelled Olynthus, ‘But raising  an equivalent city will be beyond his capabilities.’ So whenever it becomes apparent that our address on an equivalent topic is not much of an improvement, our contempt wanes considerably and our pigheadedness is curbed, and so is our self-love when tested in comparisons like this one. 
      <br>&emsp;Admiration is the opposite to contempt, and it is, of course, a sign of a more reasonable and equable nature; all the same, it too needs quite a lot of caution, and perhaps even more. The reason is that although contempt and wilfulness lessen the benefit to be gained from speakers, yet admiration and innocence increase the possibility of harm; such people bear out the truth of Heraclitus’ saying that ‘An inane person tends to get excited whatever is being said.’       
      <br>&emsp;Openness is essential when extending praise to speakers, but caution is essential when extending trust to what they say. It is crucial to be a kind and artless observer of the debaters’ language and diction, but a precise and harsh analyst of the value and truth  of what is being said: in this way, the speakers will not take against us, and at the same time their words will not harm us – amiable trust in speakers often causes us to take in false and pernicious opinions without noticing it.        
      <br>&emsp;When the Spartan government sanctioned a proposal by someone whose life had been bad, they appointed someone else, whose life and character had earned him a good reputation, to propose the motion: this was a perfectly sound and politically wise procedure to get the general populace used to being prevailed upon by how their advisers conducted themselves rather than by what they said. However, philosophical arguments must be examined entirely on their own merits, with no reference to the speaker’s reputation, because there is as much illusion in the lecture room as on the battlefield. The speaker’s grey hair, intonation, features and self-aggrandizement, and especially the audience’s cries, yells  and stamping, derange the inexperienced and youthful listener, who is swept away by the current, so to speak.      
      <br>&emsp;There is also a deceptive element to style, when the subject is addressed agreeably and at length, with a certain contrived gravity. When singers are accompanied by flutes, the audience does not notice most of their mistakes: in the same way, an elaborate and prepossessing style dazzles the hearer and blinds him to the actual subject being explained. It was Melanthius, I think, who  was asked his opinion of Diogenes’ tragedy and replied that his view had been eclipsed by a crowd of words that prevented his seeing it; and professional speakers, in their lectures and declamations, not only use words to screen their thoughts, but also make their voices agreeable by techniques such as assonance, cadence and balance, and so put their audience into an ecstatic trance – they give the audience an empty pleasure and receive in exchange an even more empty reputation. Consequently, Dionysius’ quip applies to them. Apparently, he went to a performance by an  eminent singer and player of the kithara and promised to reward the man handsomely, but later gave him nothing, on the grounds that he had already paid his debt: ‘For,’ he said, ‘all the time your songs were giving me pleasure, your hopes were giving you pleasure.’ This is the fare with which such lectures satiate the speakers: they are admired as long as they are giving pleasure, and then as soon as the pleasure of listening has evaporated, their reputation forsakes them; one party has wasted their time, the other their life. [8] 
      <br>&emsp;It follows that it is important for us to peel off any empty  excess of style and go for the actual fruit – that is, we ought to behave like bees rather than garland-weavers. The latter pick* blossom-laden, sweet-smelling plants, and plait and weave them into something pleasant but transient and barren. Bees, on the other hand, often fly past fields of violets, roses and delphiniums, and swoop down on to that most uncomfortable and acrid of plants, thyme, and alight there ‘intent on yellow honey’; and once they have taken something useful, they fly away to get on with their work. In the same way, therefore, the dedicated and  genuine listener should consider both flowery, showy language and melodramatic, ostentatious topics to be ‘the fodder of the drones’, the would-be professional speakers, and should ignore such things; instead, he should concentrate on settling his attention on the meaning of the speech and on the speaker’s attitude, and should extract from the attitude what is useful and beneficial, and bear in mind that he has not come to a theatre or a concert-hall, but to a school or classroom, with a view to correcting his life under the guidance of reason.      
      <br>&emsp;Therefore, he should base an examination and opinion of the lecture on himself and his own attitude, by considering whether any of his emotions have been at all pacified, whether any of his worries have been eased, whether resolution and spirit have been  strengthened, whether he has been inspired towards virtue and goodness. There is no point in his getting up out of a barber’s chair, standing by a mirror and touching his head to check on the haircut and the difference it has made, but failing, as soon as he leaves a lecture or a lesson, to observe himself and inspect his mind, to see whether it has lost any of its troublesome and unnecessary features, and has become less burdensome and distressing. ‘Neither a bath,’ says Ariston, ‘nor a discussion are any good unless they are cleansing.’        
      <br>&emsp;So a young man’s pleasure should be lectures which benefit  him – but he must not attend a lecture just for the pleasure of it, or think that the proper way to leave a philosopher’s school is ‘humming and grinning’, or find ways to splash perfume on himself when what he needs is a rub-down and a poultice. Instead, he should be grateful if someone treats his mind, teeming with dimness and dullness, as if it were a hive, and cleanses it with the smoke of caustic speech. For even though it is incumbent upon the speakers not completely to neglect pleasantness and persuasiveness of style, yet this ought to be the last thing on the young listener’s mind, at any rate at first. Just as it is only after they have finished drinking that people turn their cups around  and inspect the embossing, so it is only later, if you see what I mean, after a young man has had his fill of opinions and has drawn breath, that it is all right for him to think about whether the speaker’s style was elaborate and overdone.         
      <br>&emsp;On the other hand, anyone who fails to concentrate on the actual topic, and instead requires the style to be unadorned Attic, might as well refuse to drink medicine unless the cup has been made out of Attic clay or refuse to wear an overcloak in winter unless the wool came from Attic sheep: such a person sits in a light, thin cloak of Lysian language, so to speak, and is lethargic and  sluggish, because he is suffering from the diseases which have caused a dearth of intelligence, for the most part, and of good sense, and have filled the schools with pedantry and verbosity, which is what happens when the younger generation do not concentrate on a philosopher’s life or behaviour or public conduct, but give credit to style and phraseology and a good delivery, and lack the ability and the desire to examine whether the content of the delivery is useful or useless, essential or trivial and unnecessary.       
      <br>&emsp;The next subject we meet is the proposing of topics for  debate. Anyone who has come to dinner should make do with whatever is placed in front of him and not ask for something different or complain, and I would have anyone who comes to a feast of words listen in silence to the speaker, if it is a set lecture: people who try to divert the speaker on to other topics and interrupt with questions and queries are disagreeable nuisances in the audience of a lecture, derive no benefit from it, confuse the speaker and make his lecture confusing too. On the other hand, if the speaker invites the audience to ask questions and propose topics, then what is important is that it is clear that the topics one is proposing on any occasion are valuable and essential. It may be that Odysseus was mocked (in the course of the episode  with the suitors) for ‘begging for crumbs rather than swords and cauldrons’, since people who command respect are commonly held to be recognizable as much by their sizeable demands as by their sizeable gifts; but more deserving of mockery is a member of the audience who moves the speaker on to considering trivial and paltry problems – the kinds of problems some young men are in the habit of posing out of pedantry, or in order to display a philosophical or mathematical turn of mind, such as the one about the logical division of simple indefinite propositions, and ‘What is movement that is along the side or along the diagonal?’  Applicable to these people is what Philotimus said to someone who had an internal abscess and was consumptive. The man asked him for medicine for a whitlow; Philotimus assessed his condition from his complexion and breathing, and said, ‘My friend, the issue in your case is not a whitlow.’ And the same goes for you, young man: this is not the time for you to be considering such questions, but how you can stop being opinionated and big-headed, lustful and fatuous, and can secure for yourself a life which is unassuming and salutary.         
      <br>&emsp;By far the more proper course is to slant one’s questions towards the speaker’s expertise or natural ability – those matters in which he excels himself – and not to force off track the  philosopher who is inclined towards ethics by introducing topics from physics and mathematics, or the one who prides himself on his physics by drawing him into determining the validity of hypothetical propositions or resolving paradoxes like the Liar.6 We wouldn’t think that anyone trying to split logs with a key or open his door with an axe was meaning the key or the axe harm, but that he was denying himself their utility and efficacy; likewise, people who make demands of a speaker which neither nature nor training have equipped him to answer, and who reject and refuse what the speaker has to offer, are, in the first place, doing themselves no good by this behaviour, and moreover are earning  a reputation for bad manners and troublemaking.         
      <br>&emsp;One must also be careful not to keep on proposing a host of topics oneself, which is in a way a sign of ostentatiousness. But those who listen without hostility when someone else is doing the proposing are those who enjoy rational discourse and are sociable. One should speak out only if something personal is seething within one and demanding attention – it may be a feeling that needs controlling or something unhealthy that needs curing. For perhaps it is not ‘better to hide ignorance’, as Heraclitus says, but to expose it and treat it. If anger or an attack of superstition or acrimony towards one’s family or manic, lustful  desire, ‘moving the unmoved strings of the heart’, discompose the mind, then we should not avoid scrutinizing them by taking refuge in unrelated discussions, but should listen to set pieces on these very matters, and afterwards go up to the speakers on our own and ask further questions. This is what we must do, and not follow the usual, opposite course of enjoying and admiring philosophers as long as they talk about other issues, but getting irritated with them as busybodies if they disregard the rest of the audience, take one aside and talk openly about things that really  matter and remind one of them. Generally speaking, people think that philosophers ought to be listened to in schools, as dramatists are in theatres; but on non-specialist topics they think that the philosophers and they themselves are on a par. This is not an unreasonable feeling where the public speakers are concerned, who, when they get up from the seat of honour without their books and primers and deal with the realities of life, are invariably revealed as unimportant and inferior. But this is not an appropriate feeling to have about true philosophers: it would betray ignorance that in their case a serious tone and a light one, a nod and smile as well as a frown, and especially the words  discharged to an individual in private, are laden with profit for those who have trained themselves to stay put and pay attention.        
      <br>&emsp;Expressing approval, to be appropriate, also calls for care: the mean must be found, because too much or too little approval are both crass. A person who greets everything that is said with obdurate impassivity is a contemptible nuisance in the audience: he oozes hollow conceit and the deep-rooted self-aggrandizement of assuming he could improve upon what is being said, and he neither alters his appearance nor lets slip a sound which might indicate that he is listening with enjoyment and appreciation.  Instead, he uses silence, feigned seriousness and posturing to pursue a reputation as a man of calmness and depth, and – as if compliments were cash – he thinks that any compliment he pays someone else is one less for himself.        
      <br>&emsp;It is in fact common to misunderstand Pythagoras’ dictum and to distort its meaning: he said that philosophy had given him the advantage of being amazed at nothing, but they concentrate on approving of nothing and valuing nothing – they think that to be high-minded is to look down on things,* and they look for gravity in arrogance. While philosophic reason eradicates the awe and astonishment which inexperience* and ignorance generate, because it investigates and gets to know the cause of everything, it still does not destroy one’s good nature, sense of proportion  and charity. For those who are truly and unequivocally good, there is no better reward than to reward someone who deserves it, and no more glorious honour than to honour someone who deserves it – this is because they have all the reputation they need, and more than enough. On the other hand, those who are mean in complimenting others immediately give the impression of being bankrupt and starved of their own compliments.       
      <br>&emsp;Then there is also the opposite type, who has no discrimination, but gets up on his feet* and cheers word after word, syllable  after syllable; flighty and twittering, he often displeases the debaters themselves, and always annoys the audience by startling them and making them, against their will, share his excitement – it is as if fear of disapproval forces them to join in with his cheering. His applause distracts his own attention from the lecture, he gets overexcited about it and consequently he derives no benefit from it; there are three possibilities as to what reputation he will leave the lecture with – hypocrite, flatterer or philistine as far as speeches are concerned.  
      <br>&emsp;A juror at a trial must listen without inclining towards either hostility or favour, but must be rational and impartial; at a professional lecture, however, there is no law or oath stopping us from giving the speaker a kind reception. In fact, Hermes traditionally has a place alongside the Graces, because the main thing discourse demands is a favourable and friendly attitude. It is impossible for a speaker to be so thoroughly ineffective and mistaken that he fails to come out with a commendable idea or quotation or overall topic and plan, or at least a commendable use of language or structuring of his speech – ‘just as in the midst  of broom and rough restharrow the delicate snowdrop blooms’. There are some who have eulogized vomiting and fever and – hard though it may be to believe – even pots and pans: if they can do so and still be persuasive, then surely a speech given by a man who has any kind of reputation and name as a philosopher must undoubtedly provide kind and charitable listeners with some relief and an opportunity for applause.        
      <br>&emsp;At any rate, as Plato says, youthfulness never fails somehow to affect anyone who is attuned to love – and he finds something in all young men to admire and appreciate. He glosses over their defects and describes pallid young men as ‘children of the gods’, [A] swarthy ones as ‘virile’, a hook nose as ‘aristocratic’, a snub nose as ‘pert’, sallow skin as ‘honey-coloured’: any pretext suffices for love, which is as skilled as ivy at self-entanglement. And anyone who loves listening and loves rational discourse will be far more capable of finding some reason for praising each of the speeches and having it clear that his praise is not misplaced. In fact, although Plato could not condone the viewpoint of Lysias’ speech, and finds fault with its lack of structure, he still praises its style, saying that ‘every word has been lathed until it is clear and rounded’. Archilochus could be criticized for his brief, Parmenides for his awkward verse, Phocylides for his banality,6  Euripides for his verbosity,7 Sophocles for his inconsistency;8 and, of course, the same goes for the speech-writers too, one of whom is incapable of characterization, while another cannot generate emotion and a third lacks artistry. Nevertheless, each of them has his own special and innate way of stirring and moving the audience, and is to be praised for this talent; and therefore there is no shortage of reasons for the audience to treat the speakers with kindness. There is no shortage of means either, since it is not always necessary to articulate this out loud: sometimes all one needs to provide is an indulgent glance or a calm face or an aura of goodwill and satisfaction.       
      <br>&emsp;We now come to things which are recurrent, in the sense that  they are common to every lecture, even if one is faced with complete failures: not to sit languidly, but in an upright posture without slouching; to look directly at the speaker; to remain actively attentive; to keep one’s features impassive, so that one not only displays no conceit or annoyance, but also does not give the impression that one’s mind is elsewhere and otherwise engaged. Whatever the product, there is no exception to the rule that beauty is the result of a plurality (to use a mathematical image) forming a single proportion under the influence of a certain commensurability and harmony, while ugliness is generated at the precise moment that one of the elements is removed or any extra and inappropriate element is added. Likewise,  where lectures are concerned, not only do scowling, grimacing, a roving eye, twisting round and crossing one’s legs constitute inappropriate behaviour, but nodding, whispering to someone else, smiling, yawning, looking gloomily at the floor and all similar actions are also reprehensible and require plenty of restraint.   
      <br>&emsp;Some people think that the speaker has a function, while the listener does nothing. They expect the speaker to come with everything carefully thought out and prepared, while they can charge in and sit down without a care and with no thought for proper behaviour, for all the world as if it were a party they  were attending, where they could indulge themselves while others do the work. In fact, however, even a guest at a party has a function to perform, if he has good manners; and someone attending a lecture has even more of a function, because he is a shareholder in the speech and a colleague of the speaker, and he ought not to cross-examine harshly every error of speech or action the speaker commits and attempt to criticize them, while his own disgraceful behaviour goes uncriticized and he continues to conduct himself boorishly in many respects at the lecture. Instead, just as in a ball game the catcher must move and change position in a rhythm which responds to that of the thrower, so in the case of speeches there is a certain harmonious rhythm on both the speaker’s and the listener’s part, if each of them makes sure that his own conduct is appropriate.    
      <br>&emsp;Expressions of praise must not be used thoughtlessly either – even Epicurus offends when he describes his friends’ letters as ‘provoking uproarious applause’. Some people nowadays import alien expressions into the lecture room, and exclaim ‘Awesome!’ and ‘Inspired!’ and ‘Out of this world!’, as if ‘Well said!’ and ‘Cleverly put!’ and ‘True!’ (the expressions used by Plato, Socrates, Hyperides and their peers to indicate approval) were redundant. This is outrageous, and these people bring the speakers into discredit too, by implying that they need such presumptuous and excessive praise.  
      <br>&emsp;Another exceedingly offensive group are those who accompany [6A] their favourable verdict on the speakers with an oath, as if they were in a lawcourt. And no less offensive are those with incorrect estimates of speakers’ qualities, when they call out ‘Smart!’ to a philosopher, and ‘Neat!’ or ‘Brilliant!’ to an aged speaker: they transfer to philosophers expressions suitable for those who trivialize and flaunt intellectual pursuits, and they praise restrained speeches as they would a prostitute, which is like crowning an athlete with lilies or roses rather than laurel or olive.  
      <br>&emsp;Once when the poet Euripides was prompting his chorus in a lyrical ode he had composed, and a member of the chorus laughed, Euripides said, ‘It is only your insensitivity and ignorance that make you laugh while I am singing in the mixolydian mode.’ And in my opinion a philosopher or a statesman might extirpate the indiscipline of someone in the audience who had got out of hand with the words: ‘From my viewpoint you are stupid and uneducated; otherwise, you would not be twittering during my discourse (or homily or discussion) about the gods (or government or authority), and you would not be making my  words your dancing partner.’ You can see that something must be seriously wrong when passers-by wonder whether applause is for a flute-player or kithara-player or dancer, when it is actually a philosopher who is speaking – when they cannot tell, because of the cries and shouts of those inside the hall.   
      <br>&emsp;The next point is that one should not turn a deaf ear to criticism and disapproval, or run away from it. People who treat a rebuke by a philosopher with nonchalance or indifference, and laugh at reproof and praise their reprovers (which is how parasites react to their benefactors’ insults), are behaving in a thoroughly forward and reckless fashion, and no one mistakes their effrontery  for proper, genuine courage. It is true that it is not a sign of bad breeding and lack of education, but of an autonomous and disciplined character, not to get upset and to remain genial when faced with non-malicious banter which is delivered lightly and humorously; but to hear castigation and criticism whose goal is improvement of character and whose damning logic stings like medicine, and not to cower, body sweating and head spinning and mind burning with embarrassment, but instead to remain untrembling and to grin and brush it aside with a laugh, is the mark of a young man whom habitual and continuous deviance has made terrifyingly crass and deaf to conscience, and whose mind is as unreceptive of the lash as hard and callused flesh.  
      <br>&emsp;That is what these people are like, and then there are young  men with the opposite attitude, who only need to be told off once and they bolt without a backward glance and run away from their master, philosophy: their innate conscience provides them with an excellent foundation for salvation, but is extinguished by their lack of discipline and manliness because they do not stand up to censure or show their quality by accepting remedial measures, but turn aside and listen to the comfortable and untroubling talk of flatterers or professional speakers, who charm them with words that may be pleasing, but are futile and worthless. 
      <br>&emsp;Imagine someone who runs away from a doctor after surgery and refuses to submit to bandaging: he has had the pain, but rejected the beneficial part of the treatment. In exactly the same  way, someone whose inanity has been punctured and injured by reason, and who then refuses to make his inanity available for reason to heal the sore and cure him, departs from philosophy with a stinging pain, but with none of the benefit. It is not just the wound of Telephus which, in Euripides’ words, ‘is soothed by the spear’s filed flakes’: the same rationality which has caused [7A] the injury is also the healer of the pain which philosophy instils in young men of good character. It follows that a person who is at the receiving end of criticism ought to feel some discomfort and pain, but should not be depressed or downhearted: he should treat it as if philosophy had ritually initiated him, and endure the preliminary purifications and disturbances, anticipating that his present discomfort and distress will lead to a delightful and lucid state. Even if the censure seems unwarranted, it is best to put up with it and patiently hear the speaker out, and when he has finished, defend yourself to him face to face and ask him to keep the force of the candour he has just used on you for some  genuine deviance.         
      <br>&emsp;Besides, the first steps in learning how to read and write, or play music, or exercise, bring plenty of distress, hard work and confusion, and then, as one gradually progresses, increased intimacy and acquaintance (as they do in one’s dealings with other people too) make everything familiar, manageable and easy to describe and do. It is no different where philosophy is concerned: despite a degree of inevitable awkwardness and strangeness in the first terms and topics one meets, these early stages should not make one take fright and decamp like a fainthearted  coward, but one should have a go at everything in turn, persevere and work for improvement, and wait patiently for matters to become so familiar that what is good and what is pleasant are identical. This will happen before too long, and will cast plenty of light on the subject and induce an intense passion for goodness; and it is only someone consumed with stubbornness, or alternatively a coward, who could put up with a life devoid of this passion when he had not been man enough to stick to philosophy.        
      <br>&emsp;So although it is probable that for callow youths even the issues are rather opaque at first, nevertheless they have only themselves to blame for nearly all the confusion and incomprehension they get caught up in, as is proven by the fact that people of opposite characters fall into the same traps. Some, motivated by  a kind of embarrassment and an unwillingness to involve the speaker, stop themselves asking questions and fixing the speech in their minds, and just nod as if they understood; others, influenced by excessive desire for recognition and vain competitiveness, try to show how sharp they are and how quickly they learn by claiming to understand the speech before they have got the point – and so miss the point. What happens next is that after those retiring, quiet ones have left the room, they upset themselves and feel confused, and end up by being forced by necessity to approach the speakers on another occasion (which causes them even greater embarrassment) and to make a nuisance of themselves by chasing after the speakers to ask their questions; meanwhile, the hotheads who were hungry for recognition are continually having to mask and conceal their deep-rooted ignorance. [8]        
      <br>&emsp;We must, therefore, rid ourselves of such stupidity and  affectation. We must progress towards understanding and concern ourselves with grasping the point of any beneficial talk. We must endure the scorn of those who give the appearance of talent, just as Cleanthes and Xenocrates did when they appeared to be slower than their fellow pupils at school. This did not make them run away from education, nor did it make them despair: instead, they were the first to make fun of themselves, comparing themselves to narrow-necked containers and bronze engraving-plates, because although it was hard for the words to get in, yet they were preserved securely and reliably. For it is not only the case, as Phocylides says, that ‘one striving for goodness is often let down’, but it is also inevitable that he will often be  mocked and belittled, and must grapple with his ignorance and wrestle it down to the ground with total commitment even while being the butt of jokes and derision.       
      <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, we should not overlook the opposite mistake, which laziness causes some irritating and annoying people to make: they are not prepared to stir themselves by their own [8A] devices, and they bother the speaker instead by asking the same questions over and over again – they remind one of young birds before they can fly, with their mouths constantly opened towards someone else’s mouth, for whom acceptable fare is only what is ready-made and pre-processed by others. Then there are others whose inappropriate desire for a reputation for attentiveness and sharpness leads them to exhaust speakers with their chattering and inquisitiveness; they are constantly asking redundant and unnecessary questions and looking for proofs of erudition on trivial matters. ‘This is how to make a short journey long,’ as Sophocles says – and not only for themselves, but for  everyone else too. In taking the lecturer up on each and every point with superficial and superfluous questions (as if they were travel companions), they thwart the continuity of the lecture by interrupting and delaying it. These people are like cowardly and tenacious puppies – the image comes from Hieronymus – who tear at hides and shred scraps at home, but go nowhere near the actual animals.        
      <br>&emsp;We must encourage those lazy ones, however – once they have grasped the basic points – to interconnect everything else on their own, to use memory to guide original thinking, and to  accept what someone else says as a starting-point, a seed to be nourished and grown. For the correct analogy for the mind is not a vessel that needs filling, but wood that needs igniting – no more – and then it motivates one towards originality and instils the desire for truth. Suppose someone were to go and ask his neighbours for fire and find a substantial blaze there, and just stay there continually warming himself: that is no different from someone who goes to someone else to get some of his rationality, and fails to realize that he ought to ignite his innate flame, his own intellect, but is happy to sit entranced by the lecture, and  the words trigger only associative thinking and bring, as it were, only a flush to his cheeks and a glow to his limbs; but he has not dispelled or dispersed, in the warm light of philosophy, the internal dank gloom of his mind. 
      <br>&emsp;If any further advice about listening is needed, it is for us to remember what has just been said and to combine learning with working towards originality, which will enable us to acquire an attitude which is not merely sophistic and curious, but profound and philosophical – and the basis of this is the view that proper listening is the foundation of proper living.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="MoralProgress">
      Is there any argument, Sosius Senecio, which will salvage one’s sense that one is improving and approaching virtue, if in fact progress causes no relief from folly, but vice circumscribes every stage and exactly counterbalances the progress and ‘drags it down as lead does a fishing-net’? Take, for example, music or literacy: there can be no recognition of improvement here either, if the lessons do nothing to whittle away one’s ignorance of these subjects, and one’s incompetence remains perpetually at a constant level. And if medical treatment fails to relieve a patient’s discomfort or in some way alleviate the illness and cause its remission and decrease, then it cannot afford the patient any sense that his condition is changing for the better, until his body has completely recovered its strength and the treatment has engendered the opposite condition with no trace of illness at all.  
      <br>&emsp;In fact, however, people do not make progress in these domains unless they perceive the change, since the instrument of their progress is relief from what was weighing them down (as if they were on a balance, and were being carried upwards as opposed to their former downward movement). And likewise, in philosophy, no progress or awareness of progress can be assumed if the mind is not freeing and purifying itself of fallibility, but is involved in absolute vice right up to the moment when it secures absolute, perfect virtue. Of course, it takes only a moment, a split second, for the wise man to change from the worst possible iniquity to a state of consummate virtue! And in an instant he has totally and utterly escaped from the vice which he did not even partially eliminate over a lengthy period!  
      <br>&emsp;Still, I am sure you already know that the authors of these assertions turn out to find ‘the wise man who is unaware’ extremely awkward and problematic, thanks to their own assertions. Consider a person who has not yet grasped the fact that he has become wise, but is unaware and uncertain in this regard, because it has escaped his notice that, by a gradual and lengthy process of subtracting this and adding that, progress has taken place and has steadily led him, as if it were a road, to an appointment with virtue. But if the speed and size of the change were so great that someone who is the worst of sinners in the morning can become a perfect saint in the evening, or if change occurred in such a way that someone could go to bed worthless and wake up wise and, with his mind freed of yesterday’s fallibility and liability to error, could say, ‘Goodbye, false dreams; I now see that you were nothing’ – if all this were so, how could anyone not realize that a change of this magnitude had happened within himself and that wisdom had enlightened him all at once? I would sooner believe that someone like Caeneus, whose prayer to change sex from female to male is granted, could fail to notice the transformation, than that someone who had become controlled, wise and courageous instead of cowardly, stupid and weak-willed, and who has in an instant exchanged a life at a bestial level for one at the level of the gods, could be unaware of himself.  
      <br>&emsp;No, it is a correct saying that one should ‘Fit the stone to the line, not the line to the stone.’ But the people who refuse to fit their views to the facts, and instead force facts into unnatural conformity with their hypotheses, have infected philosophy with plenty of puzzles: the one which fits everyone, with the sole [76A] exception of the perfect man, into a single undifferentiated category of vice is only the greatest of these puzzles. This puzzle makes the term ‘progress’ opaque: what they call ‘progress’ is a state little short of sheer inanity, and a state which makes all those who have not rid themselves of every emotion and defect still just as miserably off as those who have not escaped even any of the very worst vices. Anyway, these thinkers refute themselves, because in their lectures they place Aristides on a par with Phalaris in respect of immorality, and Brasidas with Dolon in respect of cowardice, and even go so far as to claim that Plato and Meletus are utterly identical in respect of ignorance; but in their lives and actions they refrain and abstain from the behaviour of the latter set of people, which they acknowledge to be heartless, and attach themselves to and trust the former set, whose example, as they agree, is in the most important respects of great value.  
      <br>&emsp;We, on the other hand, can see that ‘more and less’ can be attributed to every kind of vice, and especially to mental vice, which is a genus comprising an indeterminate, limitless number of species; and we can see that this is also what makes different stages of progress different, as reason gradually illuminates and purifies the mind by pushing back imperfection as if it were darkness. Consequently, we do not find illogical the notion that people who are being carried upwards out of an abyss, so to speak, are aware of the change, and we think that this awareness has definite, describable principles.  
      <br>&emsp;Here, without further ado, is the first such principle to consider. Just as those who are running under sail in the open sea use the time along with the strength of the wind to calculate how much of their voyage they are likely to have accomplished, given that x amount of time has passed and they are being driven by y amount of power, so in philosophy one can, to satisfy oneself, take as evidence of progress the continuity and constancy of the journey, and the fact that it is rarely interrupted by pauses followed by fresh effort and impetus, but is perpetually pressing forward smoothly and evenly, and using reason to secure its passage without stumbling. The advice ‘If you add even a small amount to a small amount and do this often’ is valuable for more than just the accumulation of money: it is universally effective, and nowhere more so than in the development of virtue, when to reason is added plenty of habituation, which is what produces results.  
      <br>&emsp;Any unevenness and dullness, however, on the part of philosophers makes them not only wait and linger on the journey of progress, so to speak, but even turn back, because vice seizes every opportunity to ambush anyone who gives in and takes time off, and to carry him away in the opposite direction. Mathematicians tell us that when the planets stop moving forwards, they become stationary, but in philosophy, when progress ceases, there is no gap, no stationary mode. Since human nature is constantly in motion, it tends to tilt as if it were on a pair of scales: it is either fully extended by its better movements or, thanks to the opposite movements, it plummets towards its worse aspect. So if – as in the oracle uttered by the god which stated, ‘Fight against the Cirrhaeans every day and every night’ – if you are aware of having resisted vice day in and day out without stopping, or at least of having rarely let down your guard or of having only occasionally admitted into your presence certain pleasures or amusements or diversions with a view to making a deal with them, as if they were envoys from the army of vice, then you have every reason to proceed towards the future undaunted and in good heart.  
      <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, even if breaks occur in one’s philosophical activity, if later there is more stability to it and longer stretches of time are spent on it than before, then this is a good indication that hard work and repeated effort are squeezing laziness out. The other alternative, however, is bad – when after a short while setbacks frequently and continually occur, with enthusiasm shrivelling, so to speak. A reed starts growing with a huge spurt [77A] whose result is a smooth, unbroken length, and at first it is rarely thwarted or retarded and only at long intervals; but then (as if it had difficulty breathing up there) 6 it grows weak and consequently starts to fail and its growth is hampered by the formation of many protuberances, with little room between them, as its life-force encounters bumps and shocks. This is an analogy for what can happen in philosophy: anyone who starts with a series of energetic charges, and then continually encounters drawbacks and interruptions in large numbers, while seeing no improvement, gets fed up and gives in. ‘On the other hand, he gains wings’ applies to anyone who is motivated by the benefit of philosophy and who, with strength and enthusiasm generated by achievement, cuts through the excuses as if they were a crowd of nuisances.  
      <br>&emsp;When you are with someone you find attractive, it is not happiness that is a sign of falling in love (since this is not unique to love), but pain and distress when you are cut off from that person; and likewise, plenty of people are drawn to philosophy and apparently set about learning with a great deal of zeal, if nothing else, but if other matters or diversions drive them away, that emotion drains out of them and their mood becomes one of indifference. On the other hand, ‘anyone smitten by love for his beloved’ might strike you as placid and tame while you are together, sharing in philosophical discussion, but you should see him when he has been cut off and separated from philosophy: he is feverish, restless, dissatisfied with every matter and every diversion; his longing for philosophy impels him, as though he were a mindless beast, to forget his friends. The point is that what is required is not that people treat discussions as they do perfumes and enjoy them when they are there, but do not go out of their way for them, or even have a positive distaste for them, when they are not there; what is important is rather that, when one is cut off from philosophical discussions (whether it is getting married or a sea journey or forming a friendship or military service that causes the separation), one should feel something similar to hunger and thirst, and so stay in contact with the genuine cause of progress. For the greater the gain from philosophy has been, the greater the displeasure at separation.  
      <br>&emsp;What we have been saying is basically identical or very similar to the ancient description of progress in Hesiod – that the path ceases being steep or excessively sheer: it becomes easy, level and manageable. It is as if repeated effort levels the path, and as though the journey creates a light and a brightness in philosophy, to replace the perplexity, uncertainty and vacillation which students of philosophy come across at first, like sailors who have left the land they know, but cannot yet see the land which is their destination. For they are in the position of having left behind what is normal and familiar, but of having not yet become acquainted with and in possession of what is better: they are going round in circles in the intermediate area, and in the process often turn back towards where they have come from.  
      <br>&emsp;Sextius the Roman was a case in point: the story goes that on account of philosophy he had abandoned his offices and positions of authority in the political arena, but on the other hand was, while in the philosophical arena, in a bad way and was finding the subject difficult; he came very close to throwing himself off the top of a building. And there is a similar story about Diogenes of Sinope when he was embarking on his study of philosophy: it was an Athenian holiday, and they were having fun and staying awake all night, with meals laid on by the state, plays at the theatres, and parties with one another; Diogenes was curled up in a corner of the agora, trying to sleep, and he found himself thinking decidedly upsetting and self-destructive thoughts, trying to work out how, under no external compulsion, he had of his own free will taken on a gruelling and unnatural lifestyle, and was sitting there excluded from all those good things. Just then, however (as the story goes), a mouse crept up and occupied itself with the crumbs from his bread; Diogenes started to use his mind and reconsider, and said to himself, in a critical and disparaging tone, ‘What are you getting at, Diogenes? Your leftovers are a feast for this mouse, yet you, a man of stature – are you complaining and moaning just because you’re not lying over there on soft, gaudy blankets, getting drunk?’ So when that sort of bad mood occurs only rarely, and the mind quickly steps in to cancel it out and repel it (changing defeat into victory, as it were), and has no difficulty in getting rid of the agitation and restlessness, then one ought to regard one’s progress as being on a firm basis.  
      <br>&emsp;Their own weakness, however, is not the only factor which can make students of philosophy waver and double back. The earnest advice of friends and the mocking, bantering attacks of critics can also, on their occurrence, warp and sap resolve, and have been known to put some people off philosophy altogether. Therefore, a good indication of an individual’s progress would be equanimity when faced with these factors, and not being upset or irritated by people who name his peers and tell him how they are prospering at some royal household, or are marrying into money or are going down to the agora as the people’s choice for some political or forensic post. For anyone who is not dismayed or swayed in these circumstances has clearly been suitably and securely gripped by philosophy, since it is impossible to stop trying to conform to behaviour the majority of people admire unless one has become accustomed to admire virtue instead; even anger and insanity give some people the ability to stand up to others, but disdain for affairs commonly admired is impossible without a high purpose, truly and securely held.  
      <br>&emsp;This is also the context of the proud comparisons people make between the two concerns, as when Solon said, ‘We will not exchange our virtue for their wealth, since the one is permanent and stable, but different people have money at different times.’ And Diogenes used to compare his moves from Corinth to Athens and back again to the great king’s residency at Susa in the spring, at Babylon in the winter and in Media in the summer. Then there is Agesilaus’ remark about the great king: ‘He is a greater man than me only if he is more moral.’ And in a letter to Antipater about Alexander, Aristotle wrote that the fact that Alexander rules over a lot of people does not make him the only one who can legitimately feel proud: anyone whose thinking about the gods is correct has just as much right. And when Zeno saw that Theophrastus was admired for the number of his students, he said, ‘Although his chorus is larger, mine is more harmonious.’ Anyway, when the contrast between virtue and externals has enabled you to eliminate from yourself envy and jealousy of others, and all the things which commonly irritate and undermine beginners in philosophy, you can take this too as a clear indication of your progress.  
      <br>&emsp;Another not unimportant sign is a certain change where arguments are concerned. Almost without exception, beginners in philosophy tend to look for ways of speaking which will enhance their reputation. Some behave like birds: because they are lightweight and ambitious, they swoop down on to the brilliant heights of science. Others behave ‘like puppies’, as Plato says: ‘they enjoy dragging things around and tearing them apart’, so they head for controversies and puzzles and sophisms. A great many beginners immerse themselves in philosophical arguments and use them as ammunition in casuistry. Occasionally, beginners go around collecting quotable phrases and stories, but just as Anacharsis used to say that, in his experience, the only reason the Greeks have money is to count it, so these people – in respect of the arguments they employ – are short-changed and short-change others, and accumulate nothing else which might do them good.  
      <br>&emsp;The result of all this is illustrated by Antiphanes’ saying, in its application to Plato’s circle. Antiphanes used to tell an amusing story about a city where, as soon as anyone spoke, the sound of his voice was frozen solid, and then later, when it thawed out in the summer, they heard what had been said in the winter; likewise, he added, what Plato said to people when they were still young only just got through to most of them much later, when they were old. People also have this experience when faced with philosophy in any form, and it stops only when their discrimination becomes sound and steady, and begins to encounter the factors which instil moral character and stature, and starts to seek out arguments whose tracks (to borrow Aesop’s image) tend inwards rather than outwards. Sophocles used to say that he first lightened Aeschylus’ heaviness, then the austerity and affectedness of his own style, and only then did he, as a third step, try to change the actual nature of the language, which has the most bearing on morality and virtue; this is an analogy for the fact that it is only when students of philosophy stop using arguments for display and affectedness and turn to the kinds of argument which have an impact on the character and the emotions that they begin to make genuine, unassuming progress.  
      <br>&emsp;In the first place, then, you must make sure that when you are reading philosophical works and listening to philosophical lectures, you do not concentrate on the phraseology and exclude the subject-matter, and that you do not pounce on awkward, odd phrases rather than those which are useful, meaty and beneficial. Secondly, you must be careful, when you spend time on poetry and history, in case you overlook any well-expressed point which might improve your character or ease the weight of your emotions. For just as a bee spends time with flowers, as Simonides says, ‘intent on yellow honey’, whereas everyone else appreciates and takes in no more of the flower than its colour and scent, so, although everyone else’s involvement with poetry has the limited aim of pleasure and fun, nevertheless if someone by his own resources discovers and gathers from it something worth taking seriously, then it is by this token plausible to suggest that his training and love for what is good and congruent with his nature have brought him to the point of recognizing what is good and congruent.  
      <br>&emsp;There are people, for example, whose concern with Plato and Xenophon is limited to their language, and who glean no more than their pure Attic diction (which is, as it were, the dew and down on the flower). The only comment one can make about such people is that they appreciate the nice, flowery smell of medicines, but fail to ingest, or even recognize, their analgesic and purgative properties. By contrast, those whose progress is ongoing are capable of benefiting, and of gathering what is congruent and useful, not just from the written or spoken word, but from any sight and any situation at all.  
      <br>&emsp;Anecdotes about Aeschylus and others of similar stature illustrate the point. For instance, Aeschylus was watching a boxing-match at the Isthmian games, and whenever either of the boxers was struck, the audience yelled out loud; Aeschylus nudged Ion of Chios and said, ‘Do you see what practice can do? The man who has been struck remains quiet – it is the spectators who cry out!’ Brasidas once picked up some dried figs which had a mouse among them; the mouse nipped him and he dropped it: ‘Incredible!’ he remarked. ‘No matter how small or weak a creature is, it will live if it has the courage to defend itself.’ When Diogenes saw someone using his hands to drink, he took his cup out of his bag and threw it away.  
      <br>&emsp;These stories illustrate how attention and repeated intense effort enable people to notice and absorb the implicit virtue in everything. This is more likely to happen if they supplement theory with practice – not just ‘by studying in the school of danger’, as Thucydides puts it, but also by giving themselves a practical demonstration of their views – or preferably, forming their views by experience – whenever they are faced with pleasure and argumentativeness, or involved in decision-making, advocacy in court and political authority. As for those who, even while they are [80A] still students, occupy themselves with considering what they can take from philosophy and recycle without delay in the political arena, or to entertain their young friends, or at a reception given by the king, they are no more entitled to be regarded as philosophers than sellers of medicines are entitled to be regarded as doctors; or perhaps a better description is to say that a sophist of this kind is basically altogether identical to Homer’s bird, because he regurgitates for his pupils, as if they were his ‘flightless chicks’, anything he takes in, ‘and fares badly himself’, if he fails to consider his own advantage and to absorb or digest anything he takes in.  
      <br>&emsp;It is therefore essential for us to make sure, first, that we approach words in a way that is beneficial to ourselves, and second, where other people are concerned, that we do so not because we want empty glory or public recognition, but rather because we want to be taught and to teach. Above all, we must make sure that, when investigating issues, there is no trace of rivalry and contentiousness, and that we have stopped supplying ourselves with arguments as if they were boxing thongs or padded gloves to be used against one another, and no longer prefer bludgeoning others to the ground to learning and teaching. Reasonableness and civility during discussions, neither embarking on conversations competitively nor ending them in anger, neither crowing if an argument is won nor sulking if it is lost – all this is the behaviour of someone who is progressing nicely. Aristippus gives us an example: once he was outmanoeuvred in an argument by a man who did not lack self-confidence, only intelligence and sense; Aristippus saw that the man was delighted and had got big-headed, so he said, ‘I am going home now: I may have been argued down by you, but I will sleep more peacefully tonight than you, for all your success.’  
      <br>&emsp;When we speak, we can also assess ourselves by seeing whether or not we get afraid and hold back if a large crowd unexpectedly gathers round us, whether or not we get depressed if there are only a few to hear us debate, and whether or not, if called upon to address the Assembly or a person in authority, we throw the opportunity away by being inadequately prepared with respect to what language to use. This latter point is illustrated by stories about Demosthenes and Alcibiades. Alcibiades was extremely adept at knowing what topics to address, but less confident about what language to use and, as a result, used to trip himself up while he was addressing topics; often, even in the middle of speaking, he used to search for and hunt after an elusive word or phrase, and so get booed. By contrast, Homer was not bothered about publishing an unmetrical first line: his talent gave him plenty of self-assurance about the rest of the poem. It is therefore fairly reasonable to suppose that those who are striving for virtue and goodness will make good use of the opportunity and the topic, by being completely indifferent to any tumultuous, noisy response to their language. [0  
      <br>&emsp;The same applies to actions as well as to words: everyone should try to ensure that they contain more usefulness than showmanship, and are more concerned with truth than with display. If genuine love for a young man or for a woman does not seek witnesses, but reaps its harvest of pleasure even if it fulfils its desire in secret, then it is even more likely that someone who loves goodness and wisdom, who is intimate and involved with virtue because of his actions, will be quietly self-assured within himself, and will have no need of an admiring audience. There was a man who summoned his serving-woman at home and shouted out, ‘Look at me, Dionysia: I have stopped being big-headed!’ Analogous to this is the behaviour of someone who politely does a favour and then runs around telling everyone about it: it is obvious that he is still dependent on external appreciation and drawn towards public recognition, that he does not yet have virtue in his sights and that he is not awake, but is acting randomly among the illusory shadows of a dream and then presents his action for viewing, as if it were a painting.  
      <br>&emsp;It follows that giving something to a friend and doing a [8A] favour for an acquaintance, but not telling others about it, is a sign of progress. And voting honestly when surrounded by corruption, rejecting a dishonourable petition from an affluent or powerful person, spurning bribes and even not drinking when thirsty at night or resisting a kiss from a good-looking woman or man, as Agesilaus did – quietly keeping any of these to oneself is also a sign of progress. A man like this gains recognition from himself, and he feels not contempt, but pleasure and contentment at being self-sufficient as a witness, and spectator too, of his good deeds; this shows that reason is now being nourished within and is taking root inside him, and that he ‘is getting used to being his own source of pleasure’, as Democritus puts it.  
      <br>&emsp;Farmers prefer to see ears of corn bent over, nodding towards the ground; they regard as worthless impostors the light ones which stand up straight. Young would-be philosophers are just the same: it is those who are particularly insubstantial and lightweight who cut a dash, pose and strut, faces full of contempt and disdain which spare nothing and nobody; but when they start to fill out and gain in yield from the lectures, they shed their ostentatious pomposity. And just as the air inside empty vessels into which liquid is introduced is squeezed out and goes elsewhere, so when people are filled with genuinely good material, their pretensions are pushed aside and their self-esteem starts to crumble; they stop feeling proud of their beard and threadbare gown, and instead make their minds the object of their efforts; and they use the caustic, harsh side of their nature on themselves above all, and treat anyone else they come across with greater leniency. They put an end to their former habit of usurping and confiscating for themselves the name of philosophy and the reputation of studying philosophy; instead, if an innately good young man is even called ‘philosopher’ by someone else, he will be so dismayed that he will say with a smile, overcome by embarrassment,‘ “Look, I am no god. Why do you compare me to the gods?” ’ As Aeschylus says, ‘When a young woman has experienced a man, the heat in her eyes gives her away’; and when a young man has experienced genuine philosophical progress, these lines of Sappho’s are relevant: ‘I am tongue-tied, and delicate fire plays over my skin’ – despite which, his gaze is unworried and his eye calm and you would want to hear him speak.  
      <br>&emsp;At the start of the initiation ceremony, as the candidates assemble, they are noisy, call out and jostle one another; but when the rituals are being performed and revealed, then they pay attention in awestruck silence. Likewise, you can see plenty of disturbance and chatter and self-assurance at the beginning of philosophy, on the threshold, with some people rudely and roughly jostling for acclamation; but anyone who finds himself inside and in the presence of a great light, with the sanctuary open, so to speak, changes his attitude and becomes quiet and transfixed, and ‘with humility and restraint complies’ with reason, as he would with a god. Menedemus’ joke seems to apply rather neatly to such people. He said that the numerous people who sail to Athens to study go through the following progression: they start wise, then become philosophers, and as time goes on, they become normal people, by gradually laying aside their self-esteem and pretensions in proportion to the hold they have on reason.  
      <br>&emsp;When people need healing, if it is a tooth or a finger that is hurting, they go straight to the doctor; if they have a fever, they summon the doctor to their house and ask him to help; but if they are suffering from an extreme case – melancholy or brain fever or delirium – they sometimes cannot even stand the doctor coming to visit them, but chase him away or avoid him, because the severity of their illness prevents them even [8A] being aware that they are ill. The same goes for people with faults: it is the incurable ones who get angry and behave aggressively and fiercely towards anyone who tries to rebuke and reprimand them, whereas those who put up with rebuke and do not resist are in a more composed state. And when someone with faults puts himself in the hands of critics, talks about his defects, does not hide his iniquity and does not relish getting away with it or enjoy being unrecognized for what he is, but admits it and begs for someone to take him and reprimand him, this must be a significant sign of progress. This is surely why Diogenes used to say that anyone concerned about safety ought to try to find either a proper friend or a fervent enemy, so that one way or another – either by being rebuked or by being treated – he might steer clear of badness.  
      <br>&emsp;Imagine someone with an obvious stain or mark on his clothes or a torn shoe affecting self-deprecation as a pretence to the outside world, or someone thinking that by making fun of his own short stature or slumped posture he is showing a carefree spirit: as long as he does all this, but disguises the internal blemishes of his mind, the defects of his life, the pettiness, hedonism, malice and spite, and hides them away as if they were boils, without letting anyone touch them or see them because he is afraid of being rebuked, then his involvement in progress is minimal, or rather non-existent. On the other hand, anyone who comes to grips with these defects, and primarily anyone who has the ability and the desire to supply his own distress at and censure for his faults, but secondly anyone who has the ability and the desire to put himself in someone else’s hands for castigation, and sticks with it, and is purified by the criticism, is precisely the person who seems to have a genuine loathing for iniquity, and to be really trying to eradicate it.  
      <br>&emsp;It is, of course, important to feel embarrassed at, and to avoid, even a reputation for badness; but someone who dislikes actual iniquity more than he dislikes an adverse reputation does not avoid being reproached, and reproaching others himself, if the object is moral improvement. For instance, there is Diogenes’ nice remark to a young man he saw in a pub, who ran away – but into the pub: ‘The further inside you run,’ he said, ‘the more you are going to be in the pub!’ And the more a person denies any defect, the more he immerses and imprisons himself in the vice. It is obvious that anyone who is poor, but who pretends to be rich, increases his poverty by his masquerade; but Hippocrates, who wrote down and published the fact that he did not understand the skull’s sutures, is a model for anyone who is genuinely progressing, because he thinks it quite wrong for Hippocrates to help others avoid the situation he found himself in by publicizing his own failing, while he – a person who is committed to immunity from error – does not dare to be castigated or to admit his fallibility and ignorance.  
      <br>&emsp;In fact, it is arguable that Bion’s and Pyrrho’s assertions refer not to progress, but to a better, more perfect state. Bion told his friends that they deserved to think they were progressing when they could listen to abuse and be affected as if what was being said was ‘ “My friend, you don’t seem bad or foolish, so I wish you health and great joy, and may the gods grant you prosperity.” ’ And there is a story about Pyrrho that once when he was endangered by a storm at sea, he pointed to a piglet which was happily tucking into some barley that had been spilled, and told his companions that anyone who did not want to be disturbed by events should use the rational mind and philosophy to develop a similar detachment.  
      <br>&emsp;You should also notice what Zeno said – that a person’s dreams ought to make him aware that he is progressing, if when asleep he sees himself neither enjoying anything discreditable, nor conniving at or doing anything awful or outrageous, but if instead he feels as though he were in translucent depths of tranquil stillness and it dawns upon him that the imaginative and emotional part of his mind has been dispersed by reason. Plato also apparently realized this point, before Zeno, and he described in outline the imaginative, irrational aspect of an innately tyrannical mind and the sorts of things it does when asleep: ‘He tries to have sex with his mother’, feels compulsions for all kinds of foods, transgresses convention and acts as though his desires, which by day are shamed and cowed into restraint by convention, had been set free.  
      <br>&emsp;Draught-animals which have been well trained do not attempt to stray and deviate, even if their master lets the reins go slack: they press forward in an orderly fashion, obedient to their conditioning, and unfailingly keep to their course. In the same way, people whose irrational aspect has been tamed and civilized and checked by reason find that it loses its readiness to use its desires to act outrageously and unconventionally even when dreaming or when under the influence of illness; instead, it watches protectively over its conditioning and remains aware of it, since it is conditioning which gives our attention strength and energy. If, as a result of training, detachment can gain control over even the body – over the whole body and any of its parts – so that eyes faced with a harrowing sight resist weeping and a heart surrounded by horrors resists lurching, and genitals modestly keep still and cause no trouble at all in the company of attractive men or women, then naturally this increases the plausibility of suggesting that training can take hold of the emotional part of the mind and, so to speak, smooth it and regularize it by suppressing its illusions and impressions at all levels, including dreaming.  
      <br>&emsp;There is a story about the philosopher Stilpo which illustrates the point. Once he dreamed he saw Poseidon and that Poseidon was angry with him for having omitted to sacrifice an ox (which was a standard offering to Poseidon), but Stilpo was not perturbed in the slightest and said, ‘What do you mean, Poseidon? Don’t you think it’s childish of you to come and complain that I didn’t bankrupt myself and fill the city with the smell of burnt offerings, but instead sacrificed to you on a moderate scale at home, drawing on what I actually had?’ And then he dreamed that Poseidon smiled, extended his right hand and said that, because of Stilpo, he would create for Megara a bumper crop of sardines.  
      <br>&emsp;So anyway, when people have dreams which are pleasant, clear and untroubled, and sleep which brings back no trace of anything frightening or horrible, or malicious or warped, they say that these features are beams of the light of progress; but they say that the features of distressing and bizarre dreams – frenzy, agitation, running from danger like a coward, experiencing childish delights and miseries – are like breakers and billows, and originate in a mind which does not yet have its own regulator, but is still being formed by opinions and rules, so that when it is asleep and as far from these formative influences as it can be, it is again dissolved and unravelled by the emotions. Now, you must join me in considering, by yourself, whether this phenomenon I have been talking about stems from progress or from a state which already has the steady, solid strength which comes of being based on reason.  
      <br>&emsp;Since absolute detachment is an exalted, divine state, and progress towards it is, as I say, like a kind of alleviation and taming of the emotions, 
      <br>&emsp;then it is important for us to examine our emotions and to assess their differences, comparing them with themselves and with one another. We must compare them with themselves to see if the desires and fears and rages we now experience are less intense than they were before, given that we are using reason rapidly to extinguish their violence and heat; and we must compare them with one another to see if our sense of disgrace is now more acute than our fear, and whether we prefer to emulate people rather than envy them, and value a good reputation more than we value money. In short, we must compare them with one another to see if, to use a musical analogy, we err on the side of the Dorian rather than the Lydian mode, whether our lifestyle inclines towards asceticism rather than indulgence, whether our actions tend to be slow rather than hasty, and whether we are astounded by rather than contemptuous of arguments and people. Where ailments are concerned, it is a good sign when the disease is diverted into parts of the body where it will not prove fatal; and likewise where vice is concerned, it is plausible to suggest that when people who are making progress find that their vices now engage more respectable emotions, those vices are gradually being eliminated. When Phrynis strung two extra strings on the lyre, in addition to the usual seven, the ephors asked him whether he was prepared to let them cut off the top two or the bottom two; but the first point to make about ourselves is that what is required is, as it were, that the top ones and the bottom ones are cut out, if we are going to settle on an intermediate, moderate position; 
      <br>&emsp;and the second point is that progress begins with the lessening of our emotions’ extremity and intensity, ‘lusting after which,’ as Sophocles says, ‘makes one overwrought’.  
      <br>&emsp;Now, we have said that translating decisions into actions and not allowing words to be just words without turning them into deeds is particularly typical of progress. What is significant in this context is modelling our behaviour on what we commend and being keen to do what we express admiration for, while being unwilling even to connive at what we find fault with. For example, although it was not surprising that Miltiades’ courage and bravery were universally applauded in Athens, nevertheless, when Themistocles said that Miltiades’ trophy stopped him sleeping and allowed him no rest, it was immediately obvious that he was doing more than just expressing approbation and admiration: he was also moved to emulate and imitate Miltiades. So we must regard our progress as minimal as long as our admiration of success lies fallow and remains inadequate in itself to spur us towards imitation.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that physical love is not a force for change unless it is accompanied by the desire to emulate; and commendation of virtue is also tepid and ineffective unless it nudges us and goads us to stop being envious and instead to want – with a desire that demands satisfaction – to emulate good behaviour. Alcibiades stressed the importance of the heart being moved by a philosopher’s words and of tears being shed, but that is not all that is important: anyone who is making genuine progress compares his own conduct with the deeds and actions of a man who is an exemplar of goodness, and is simultaneously aggravated by the awareness of his defects, happy because of his hopes and aspirations, and full of a restless compulsion. Consequently, he is liable to ‘run like an unweaned foal close to a horse’ (to use a line from Semonides), 
      <br>&emsp;because he longs to be virtually grafted on to the good man. In fact, this experience is typical of genuine progress – dearly to love the character of those whose conduct we desire to imitate, and always to accompany our wanting to be like them with goodwill which awards them respect and honour. On the other hand, anyone feeling competitively envious of his betters must realize that it is jealousy of a certain reputation or ability that is provoking him, and that he is not respecting or admiring virtue.  
      <br>&emsp;So when our love for good men starts to be such that we not only, as Plato says, count as blessed both the responsible man himself and anyone who listens ‘to the words emitted by a responsible mouth’, but we also admire and cherish his posture, walk, look and smile, and long to attach and glue ourselves to him, so to speak, then we can legitimately consider ourselves to be making genuine progress. This is even more legitimate if we do not admire only the successful aspects of men of virtue, but behave like lovers who are not put off if those they find attractive have a speech defect or a pallid complexion: despite the tears and misery brought on by her grief and misfortune, Pantheia still thrilled Araspes, and in the same way we should not be repelled by Aristides’ exile,5 Anaxagoras’ imprisonment, Socrates’ poverty 
      <br>&emsp;or Phocion’s condemnation, but because we regard virtue as desirable even under these circumstances, we should draw near to it, quoting Euripides’ line whenever the occasion demands – ‘It’s incredible how high-minded people find nothing bad!’ You see, someone who is inspired enough to admire and want to imitate even apparently awful things, rather than be put off by them, can certainly never be deterred from good things ever again. It has already become such a person’s practice, when he is embarking on some course of action, or taking up office, or taking a risk, to picture truly good men of the past and to wonder, ‘What would Plato have done in this situation? What would Epaminondas have said? How would Lycurgus or Agesilaus have come across?’ He uses each of them as a kind of mirror, before which he puts himself in order, or adjusts his stance, or refrains from some relatively petty saying of his, or resists an emotion. Some people learn the names of the Dactyls of Mount Ida and steadily recite each one, as a spell to ward off fear; but if thoughts and memories of good men readily occur to people who are making progress and make them think again, then they keep them true and safe, whatever emotions and difficulties beset them. It follows that this is another mark by which you can tell someone who is morally improving.  
      <br>&emsp;Moreover, to have stopped getting all flustered, blushing and hiding or rearranging some idiosyncrasy when a person who is famous for his self-control unexpectedly appears, but instead to go up to such people confidently, can corroborate one’s awareness. Alexander apparently once saw a messenger running towards him with his right hand extended and looking very pleased. ‘What news, my friend?’ said Alexander. ‘Has Homer come back to life?’ For he thought that the one thing his exploits lacked was a voice that would give him undying fame. 
      <br>&emsp;But the love which fills the character of a young man who is improving is, above all else, love of showing off before truly good people and of displaying his home, board, wife, children, occupation and spoken and written compositions; and consequently it is a source of pain for him to remember that his father or his tutor is dead and cannot see him in his present condition, and the one thing in particular he would pray to the gods for would be that they might come back to life and so witness his lifestyle and conduct. On the other hand, people who have taken no responsibility for themselves and who have been spoiled are quite the opposite: they cannot even dream about their relatives calmly and without anxiety. 
      <br>&emsp;There is another mark, no minor one, for you to add, please, to the ones we have already discussed. It is to have stopped regarding any of one’s faults as trivial, and instead to take thorough care about and to pay attention to all of them. People who do not expect to become affluent have no qualms about spending small amounts, because they think that adding to the small amount they already have will not produce a large amount, whereas anticipation joins with savings to increase love of affluence the closer it gets to its goal. It is the same with conduct which pertains to virtue: if someone scarcely gives in to ‘What’s the point?’ and ‘That’s it for now – better next time’, but applies himself on every occasion, and gets fed up and irritated if vice ever worms its way, with its excuses, into even the slightest of his faults, then he is obviously in the process of acquiring for himself a certain purity and wants to avoid being defiled in any way whatsoever. On the other hand, thinking that nothing is, or can be, especially discreditable makes people nonchalant and careless about the little things. In fact, when a wall of some kind or other is being built, it does not make any difference if the odd piece of wood or ordinary stone is used as infrastructure, or if a stele that has fallen off a tomb is put in the footings, which is analogous to the conduct of degenerates who jumble together into a single heap any old business and behaviour. But people who are progressing, and who have already ‘fashioned a fine foundation’ 
      <br>&emsp;for their life (as if it were a home for gods and kings), do not admit things chosen at random, but use reason as a straight-edge by which to apply and fit every single part together. And this, in my opinion, is what Polyclitus was referring to when he said that those whose clay is at the stage when fingertips are required have the hardest task.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="OfContentment">
      I hope this finds you well, Paccius. Not long ago, I got your letter, in which you suggested that I write down for you something about contentment, and about those passages in Timaeus which need rather careful interpretation. At pretty much the same time, our friend Eros suddenly found he had to sail to Rome, since he had received a letter from the illustrious Fundanus; typically, Fundanus told him to hurry. On the one hand, I didn’t have as much time as I wanted to get to grips with the topics you were asking me to address; but on the other hand, I couldn’t bear the idea of Eros leaving here, going to you and being found to be completely empty-handed. So I read those bits of my notebooks, written in fact for myself, which covered the topic of contentment. I imagined that what you too wanted from this discourse was practical help, not a lecture whose aim was elegant composition; and I share your pleasure in the fact that although you have friends in positions of authority, and although you have a pre-eminent reputation as a political speaker, you have not experienced what Merops did in the tragedy: it is not the case, as it was with him, that ‘the adulation of the masses has driven you mad’ and into abnormal behaviour. No, you have taken to heart what you have often been told: gout is not alleviated by a patrician shoe, nor a whitlow by an expensive ring nor a migraine by a crown.’ How on earth can assets or a reputation or power at court contribute towards having a mind that is free of distress and a life that is as calm as a millpond, unless their possession and use are pleasant, but at the same time they are never missed if they are lacking? And what else guarantees this except rationality which has become accustomed to quickly restraining – and taking care to do so – the emotional, irrational part of the mind on the many occasions when it tries to exceed its bounds, and not conniving at its flooding and racing away from what is actually there?  
      <br>&emsp;Xenophon recommends that we remember and acknowledge the gods particularly in times of prosperity, so that when we are in need, we can confidently petition them in the knowledge that they are predisposed to be charitable and friendly. It is no different in the case of rational arguments which help us combat the emotions: anyone with any sense should pay attention to them before emotion arises, so as to widen his defensive preparations and thereby increase the benefit he gains. You know how aggressive dogs get thoroughly agitated at any and every loud voice and are calmed down only by the one with which they are familiar; so the mind’s emotions too are hard to restrain when they are overexcited, unless rational arguments are already there, ingrained and familiar, to check the agitation.  
      <br>&emsp;Whoever it was who said that ‘Contentment is impossible for anyone who busies himself with personal or public affairs’ makes contentment, in the first place, an expensive commodity if its price is inactivity. It is as though his prescription for every invalid is to say, ‘ “You poor thing, stay perfectly still in your bed” ’, whereas inertia is in fact no good as a treatment for a body suffering from numbness and, as psychiatry, it is equally ineffective to try to remove agitation and distress from the mind by means of laziness, weakness and betrayal of friends, household and country.  
      <br>&emsp;Moreover, in the second place, it is not true that anyone who is not busy is content. It would follow that women are more content than men, since they generally deal only with domestic matters; but in fact, although (in Hesiod’s words) the north wind ‘does not reach a young woman’s tender body’, nevertheless distress, disturbance and depression trickle into the women’s quarters through the agency of jealousy, superstition, ambition and innumerable empty beliefs. Laertes spent twenty years by himself away from civilization, ‘with an old woman to look after him, who served his food and drink’, and although he shunned his country, home and kingdom, nevertheless his inactivity and ennui had distress as a constant close companion. Even absolute inactivity is likely to induce discontent in some cases: for example, ‘But swift-footed Achilles, Peleus’ son, descended from Zeus, stayed sitting by his sharp-prowed ships and never went to assembly, which brings men prestige, or to battle, but stayed there with his heart pining in longing for the war cry and for battle.’ The depth of his feeling and his grief caused him to say to himself, ‘I sit by my ships, a pointless burden to the world.’  
      <br>&emsp;This is why not even Epicurus thinks that a quiet life is desirable; he says that people who want status and fame should go along with this aspect of their nature and engage in politics and public life, because they are inherently more likely to be thrown off balance and to be harmed by inactivity – by failing to fulfil their desires. But it is ridiculous for him to recommend public life, not to those with talent, but to those who are incapable of living peacefully. Contentment and discontent should be defined not by the frequency or rarity of one’s actions, but by their goodness or badness: the omission of good deeds is – and this has been said before – just as annoying and disturbing as the commission of bad deeds.  
      <br>&emsp;There are people who think that freedom from distress resides in one way of life in particular – for instance, in farming or bachelorhood or kingship. What Menander said can act as a reminder for them: ‘Phanias, I used to think that rich people, because they have no debts, don’t sigh at night, or toss and turn, or moan “Poor me!”; I used to think they slept a pleasant, peaceful sleep.’ He goes on to explain that, in his experience, even the rich suffer exactly as the poor do, and then says, ‘Is grief related in some way to life? It consorts with a life of luxury, is inseparable from a life of fame, grows old with a life of poverty.’  
      <br>&emsp;Consider people who are scared of sailing or who get seasick: they imagine that the voyage will pass more easily if they exchange a skiff for a merchant ship, and then the merchant ship for a trireme; but this gets them nowhere, because they take their sickness and fears with them. This is an analogy for exchanging one way of life for another; it does not eradicate from the mind the factors which make it distressed and disturbed, which are unworldliness, lack of discrimination and not being able, or not knowing how, to make proper use of one’s present circumstances. These are the storm winds that vex both rich and poor, trouble both married and single; they make men shun public life and then find a quiet life intolerable; they make men pursue promotion at court and be miserable as soon as they get it. ‘Helplessness makes sick people a peevish lot’: their wives irritate them, they complain about their doctors, grumble about their beds and ‘for a friend to come is a nuisance, to leave is an offence’, as Ion says. But when the illness has dissolved and the humours are differently blended, health comes and makes everything nice and pleasant, in the sense that someone who yesterday detested eggs and cakes and bread made from fresh wheat, today is even glad to eat coarse bread with olives or mustard seeds.  
      <br>&emsp;The engendering of rationality within us causes this kind of satisfaction with, and change of attitude towards, any way of life. Alexander once shed tears while listening to Anaxarchus lecture on the existence of an infinite number of worlds. His friends asked him what the matter was, and he replied, ‘Don’t you think tears are called for, if there are an infinite number of worlds, and I’ve not yet gained control of just one?’ On the other hand, Crates, with his bag and threadbare cloak, spent his whole life joking and laughing as though he were on holiday. Moreover, Agamemnon was troubled by his extensive responsibilities as king – ‘You will recognize Agamemnon, son of Atreus, whom Zeus has singled out for constant hard work’ – but when Diogenes was up for sale, he lay on the ground and teased the auctioneer by refusing to get up when told to, but joking and saying with a laugh, ‘Imagine it’s a fish you’re trying to sell!’ Or again, Socrates went on discussing philosophy with his companions while he was in prison, but Phaethon used to weep when he had scaled the heights of heaven, if no one gave him his father’s horses and chariot.  
      <br>&emsp;It is the shoe that bends along with the foot, not the other way around; and likewise, an implication of what we have been saying is that disposition moulds life. I mean, the notion that familiarity makes the best life pleasant for anyone who has chosen it is wrong: it is rational intelligence which makes the life one already has both the best one and the most pleasant one. It follows that we should purify our innate well of contentment and then external things will be in harmony with us too, provided we don’t maltreat them, and will seem congruent and congenial. ‘There’s no point in getting angry with one’s situation, because it is utterly indifferent; but success will accrue to anyone who treats the situations he encounters correctly.’  
      <br>&emsp;Plato compared life to a game of dice in which it is not just important to throw something appropriate, but also to make good use of it however the throw turns out. And where our situations are concerned, it may be true that we do not control the throw of the dice, but it is our job, if we are sensible, to accommodate ourselves to whatever fortune deals us and to allocate everything to a place where, as each situation arises, if it is congruent, we can maximize its benefit, and if it is unwelcome, we can minimize its harm. A physical illness can make people incapable of enduring either heat or cold, and those who muddle unintelligently through life are like that, in the sense that they get ecstatic at good fortune and depressed at bad fortune – which is to say that both good and bad fortune knock them off balance, or rather that they knock themselves off balance when they encounter either of them; and it is the same story when they encounter anything that one might term good. Theodorus the Atheist (as he was called) used to say that although he delivered his lectures with his right hand, the audience caught them in their left hands; and uneducated people, faced with a favourable or right-handed opportunity, often take it up awkwardly or left-handedly and make fools of themselves. Thyme, the most acrid and dry of plants, provides bees with honey; and likewise intelligent people can invariably find something congruent with and useful to themselves from the most forbidding of situations.  
      <br>&emsp;The chief thing, then, to practise and pursue is the attitude exemplified by the man whose stone missed his dog and hit his stepmother: ‘That’s not bad either!’ he said. It is possible to change opportunities so that they are no longer unwelcome. Diogenes was exiled; ‘That’s not bad either’, because he subsequently took up philosophy. Zeno of Citium had just one ship left from his merchant fleet; when he was told that this one too was lost, sunk with all its cargo, he said, ‘Thank you, fortune, for helping to drive me into a threadbare cloak.’  
      <br>&emsp;Why can’t the rest of us behave in the same way? Have you failed to capture some public position you were after? You can live in the country, minding your own business. Have you been spurned while courting the affection of someone in authority? You can now live a life free of risk and bother. Is your time again taken up with worldly business and worries? Well, to quote Pindar, ‘the extent to which warm water relaxes a body is nothing’ compared to how fame and respect, conjoined with power, make ‘work pleasant and labour non-laborious’. Are you faced with misery and insults because lies or malicious tales are being spread about you? This is a following wind, blowing you towards the Muses and the Academy, as Plato was driven by the storm winds of his friendship for Dionysius.  
      <br>&emsp;It follows that another thing that is important for contentment is to reflect on famous men, and how they have not been affected at all by circumstances identical to one’s own. Is childlessness your problem, for example? Look at the kings of Rome, none of whom had a son to whom he could bequeath his kingdom. Are you weighed down by poverty at the moment? But is there any Boeotian you would rather be than Epaminondas, any Roman rather than Fabricius? ‘But my wife has been seduced!’ Well, haven’t you read the inscription at Delphi which goes ‘Erected by Agis, lord of water and of earth’? And haven’t you heard that this is the man whose wife Timaea was seduced by Alcibiades, and that in an undertone to her serving-women she used to call her child Alcibiades? Yet this did not stop Agis from being the most famous and important Greek of his day. Nor, for example, did the promiscuity of Stilpo’s daughter stop him living a more carefree life than any of his philosophical contemporaries. In fact, when Metrocles told him off for his daughter’s behaviour, Stilpo’s response was, ‘Is it my fault or hers?’ ‘Metrocles said, ‘Her fault, but your misfortune.’ ‘What do you mean?’ asked Stilpo. ‘Isn’t a fault a mistake?’ ‘Certainly,’ said Metrocles. ‘And isn’t anyone making a mistake also suffering a setback?’ continued Stilpo. Metrocles agreed. ‘And isn’t anyone suffering a setback also suffering a misfortune?’ Stilpo concluded. This calm, philosophical argument showed the Cynic’s aspersion to be empty barking.  
      <br>&emsp;Still, most people are hurt and provoked, by their enemies’ flaws, as well as by those of their friends and relatives. I mean, being inclined towards insolence, anger, spite, malice, jealousy and hostility not only plagues those people who have these weaknesses, but also annoys and irritates foolish people – as, of course, do a neighbour’s short temper, an acquaintance’s grumpiness and a public administrator’s iniquity. And I think that you too are very far from failing to get upset at these flaws; like the doctors in Sophocles who ‘use bitter medicine to flush out bitter bile’, you react to these affections and afflictions with rage and bitterness. But this is unreasonable, because the public business which has been entrusted to you and which you conduct is managed by people whose characters are not straightforward and good, as well-made tools should be, but are invariably jagged and warped; and you should not, therefore, consider it to be your job – or at any rate you should not consider it to be an easy job – to straighten them out. However, if you use them as a doctor uses tooth extractors and wound clamps – that is, as being made just the way they are – and if you show yourself to be as lenient and moderate as circumstances permit, then your pleasure in your own attitude will outweigh your distress at others’ unsatisfying and iniquitous behaviour, you will regard them as doing what comes naturally to them (as dogs are when they bark) and you will stop unwittingly being infected by others’ flaws, which is to let plenty of distressing factors seep into the sunken and low-lying land of this pettiness and weakness of yours.  
      <br>&emsp;Some philosophers find fault even with compassion, when it is felt for people who are out of luck, on the grounds that while helping people one comes across is a good thing, sharing their troubles and giving in to them is not. More importantly, they forbid us to be discontented or depressed even when we realize that we ourselves have flawed and defective characters; they tell us instead not to get distressed, but just to try to cure the problem, as is right and proper. You should consider, then, how utterly illogical it is for us to connive at ourselves getting cross and irritated because not everyone with whom we have dealings and who crosses our paths is fair and congenial.  
      <br>&emsp;No, my dear Paccius, you must make sure that we are not deceiving ourselves by denouncing and being worried about the iniquity of people we come across only in so far as it affects us, rather than in general – that is, you must make sure that we are not being motivated by selfishness, but by hatred of badness. The point is that if we are unduly discomposed by public life and if we have unwarranted impulses and aims, or alternatively unwarranted aversions and antipathies, then this makes us suspicious of people and irritated by them, because we think that they are the causes of our losses and accidents. A high degree of contentment and calmness in relating to people is an attribute of someone who has trained himself to cope with public life without fuss and bother.  
      <br>&emsp;Bearing this in mind, let us return to the matter of one’s situation. When we have a fever, everything tastes bitter and unpleasant, but once we have seen other people taking the same food without revulsion, we stop blaming the food and drink, and start to blame ourselves and our illness. In the same way, we will stop blaming and being disgruntled at circumstances if we see other people cheerfully accepting identical situations without getting upset. So when unwelcome incidents occur, it is also good for contentment not to ignore all the gratifying and nice things we have, but to use a process of blending to make the better aspects of our lives obscure the glare of the worse ones. But what happens at the moment is that, although when our eyes are harmed by excessively brilliant things we look away and soothe them with the colours that flowers and grasses provide, we treat the mind differently: we strain it to glimpse the aspects that hurt it, and we force it to occupy itself with thoughts of the things that irritate it, by tearing it almost violently away from the better aspects. And yet the question addressed to the busybody can be transferred to this context and fit in nicely: ‘You spiteful man, why are you so quick to spot someone else’s weakness, but overlook your own? ‘ So we might ask: why, my friend, do you obsessively contemplate your own weakness and constantly clarify it and revivify it, but fail to apply your mind to the good things you have? Cupping-glasses extract from flesh anything particularly bad, and likewise you are attracting to yourself the very worst of your attributes. You are making yourself no better at all than the Chian who used to sell plenty of quality wine to other people, but for his own meal used to taste wines until he found a vinegary one; and when someone asked one of his servants what he had left his master doing, the servant replied, ‘Looking for bad when surrounded by good.’  
      <br>&emsp;As a matter of fact, most people do bypass what is good and refreshing in their lives, and make straight for the unpleasant, bad elements. Aristippus was different, however: he was good at lightening himself and raising himself up (imagine him on a pair of scales) towards the better aspects of his situation. At any rate, he once lost a fine estate, and people were insincerely saying how sorry and sympathetic they felt. He asked one of them, ‘Haven’t you got just one little plot of land, while I have still got three farms?’ The fellow said yes, and Aristippus said, ‘Why, then, am I not feeling sorry for you, rather than the other way round?’ The point is that it is crazy to be upset about what one has lost and not feel happy about what one has kept; otherwise, we are behaving like little children who, when deprived of just one of their many toys, wail and scream and throw all the rest of their toys away. In the same way, if we let fortune distress us just once, then our whining and resentment deprives everything else as well of any benefit for us.  
      <br>&emsp;Someone might ask, ‘But what can we be said to have or not to have?’ Fame, property, married status, a good friend – these are the things people have. When Antipater of Tarsus was close to death, he added up the good things that had happened to him, and included even the easy voyage he had had from Cilicia to Athens. And we must not overlook even things we share with others, but take them into account, and be thankful that we have life and health and that we walk the earth; that there is no war, either foreign or civil, but that we may, if we so choose, farm the land and sail the seas without fear; that the full range of possibilities is open to us, from oratory and politics to a quiet, inactive life. When we have these shared things, we will increase our contentment with them if we imagine that we do not have them, and frequently remind ourselves how desirable health is to sick people, peace to people at war, and the acquisition of fame and friends to an obscure stranger in a city as big as yours, and also remind ourselves how distressing it is to lose these things if they have been ours in the past. If we do this, then we will not rate and value any of these things highly only once it has been lost, while discounting it altogether as long as it is in our keeping. I mean, the fact that we do not own something does not increase its value; and we should not be acquisitive as if these things were important, and be constantly trembling in fear of losing them as if they were important, but ignore them and belittle them, while we have them, as if they were worthless. Instead, while we have [0A] them, we should above all use them for our enjoyment and profit from them, so that, in the event of their loss, we can endure this too with greater equanimity. Arcesilaus used to point out that although most people think it their duty to use their minds to explore and their eyes to examine other people’s poems, paintings and statues in precise and minute detail, yet they forget their own lives, which could provide plenty of areas for pleasurable reflection: they constantly look outwards and are impressed by other people’s fame and fortune, just as adulterers are by other men’s wives, but belittle themselves and what they already have.  
      <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, another thing that is important for contentment is to restrict one’s inspection as much as possible to oneself and those things which are relevant to oneself, or else to consider people who are less well off than oneself. What one should avoid is lining oneself up against people who are better off, despite the fact that this is the usual practice: prisoners, for instance, envy those who have been freed, who envy people who have always been free, who envy those with citizen status, who in turn envy rich people, who envy province commanders, who envy kings, who – because they almost aspire to making thunder and lightning – envy the gods. Consequently, since they never attain things which are out of their reach, they are never thankful for the things that are relevant to them. ‘Gold-laden Gyges’ possessions are of no interest to me; I have never yet been gripped by envy, nor do I seek to emulate what the gods do, nor do I desire a great kingdom. I do not set my sights on such distant views.’  
      <br>&emsp;Someone might say, ‘That’s because this is a Thasian speaking.’ But there are other provincials – from Chios, Galatia or Bithynia – who are dissatisfied with having obtained a portion of status or power among their compatriots, and who weep because they do not wear patrician robes; and if they do, then because they have not yet held military command at Rome; and if they have, then because they are not consuls; and if they are, then because when the announcement was made, they did not head the list. The only possible description of this is self-mortification and self-inflicted punishment, as a result of scrabbling for reasons to be ungrateful to fortune. On the other hand, anyone whose mind sanely reflects that the sun sees countless thousands of humans – ‘all we who enjoy the broad land’s produce’ – does not slump into depression and despondency if there are people more famous and rich than himself; there are so many human beings that his life is a thousand times more perfect than thousands of people’s, so he continues on his path, celebrating his own destiny and life.  
      <br>&emsp;It may be impossible to choose one’s opponents in the Olympic Games and so gain victory that way, but life’s situations do often present one with opportunities for appreciating one’s better position – for being envied rather than envying others – unless, of course, it is Briareus or Heracles one pits oneself against! So when you find yourself overawed by the apparent superiority of a man who is being carried in a sedan chair, make sure you look down and also see those who are keeping him off the ground; and when you find yourself envying Xerxes, as the Hellespontian did, on the famous occasion of Xerxes’ pontoon crossing, make sure you also see the men being driven by whips to excavate Mount Athos and the men with faces mutilated when the bridge was destroyed by the waves; if you take their thoughts into consideration as well, you find that they are envying your life and your situation. Socrates once heard one of his acquaintances remarking how expensive Athens was: ‘A mina for Chian wine, three minae for a purple-dyed robe, five drachmae for a kotyle of honey.’  
      <br>&emsp;Socrates grabbed hold of him and showed him some grain – ‘An obol for half a hekteus – Athens is cheap’; and then some olives – ‘Two bronze coins for a choinix – Athens is cheap’; and then some simple cloaks – ‘Ten drachmae – Athens is cheap.’ So when we too hear someone remarking on how trivial and terribly distressing our personal situations are, because we are not consuls or governors, we can reply, ‘Our situations are not at all unprepossessing, and our lives are to be envied, because we are not beggars or porters or flatterers.’  
      <br>&emsp;Despite all this we habitually live, out of stupidity, with our attention on others rather than on ourselves. So since human nature contains plenty of malicious envy and spite, with the result that the degree of pleasure we feel in what is ours is less than the degree of irritation we feel at others’ successes, then you must not only notice the splendid and pre-eminent features of the people you envy and admire, but you must also remove and draw aside the florid veil, so to speak, of their reputation and their façade, and get inside, where you will notice that they contain plenty of unsavoury features and plenty of unpleasantness. At any rate, something Pittacus said is instructive, since he is outstandingly famous for courage, wisdom and morality: he once had some friends round for dinner, and his wife burst in angrily and overturned the table; his friends were astounded, but he said, ‘No one’s life is perfect; anyone with only my troubles is very well off.’  
      <br>&emsp;‘In public this man is an object of envy, but as soon as he opens the door of his home, he’s in a pitiful state: his wife is in complete control, she bosses him about and argues all the time. He’s got rather a lot of reasons to be miserable, whereas I’ve got none.’ Plenty of these kinds of troubles accompany wealth, fame and kingship, but most people fail to notice them under the showy veneer. ‘Son of Atreus, you are fortunate – your birth was favoured by fate and your destiny is to prosper’: this kind of accolade is given for weaponry, horses and an extensive army, for external possessions, but from within come the contradictory emotional cries, bearing witness against this hollow fame – ‘Zeus the son of Cronus has thoroughly imprisoned me in deep madness’ and ‘I envy you, old man, and I envy anyone whose life is at an end, if he has kept himself safe by avoiding recognition and fame.’ Here is another point we should bear in mind, then, to enable us to carp less against fortune and to decrease the extent to which, by admiring our acquaintances’ attributes, we belittle and denigrate our own.  
      <br>&emsp;Now, a major impediment to contentment is the failure to keep our desires furled or unfurled, so to speak, in a way which is commensurate with the prevailing potential. Instead, we give them too much slack through our hopes, and then when we fail, we blame fate and fortune, but not our own stupidity. We wouldn’t describe as unfortunate anyone who wanted to shoot with his plough and hunt hares with his cow, nor would we say that anyone who fails to capture deer or boar with fishing-baskets or seines is being opposed by bad luck: it is stupidity and silliness which are setting him to impossible endeavours. The chief cause is in fact self-love, which makes people ambitious and competitive whatever the situation, and makes them greedily take on everything: they not only expect to be rich, erudite, strong, outgoing, pleasant and intimate with kings and leaders of nations, but they are discontented if their dogs, horses, quails and cocks are not the best at what they do.  
      <br>&emsp;Dionysius the Elder was not satisfied with being the most important tyrant of the time, but because his verse was worse than that of Philoxenus the poet, and he failed to do better than Plato at philosophical discussion, he got furiously angry – he imprisoned Philoxenus in the quarries, and he sent Plato to Aegina to be sold into slavery. Alexander was different: when the sprinter Crison was racing with him and gave the impression of deliberately slowing down, Alexander was very cross. And Achilles in the poem does well too: he starts off saying, ‘None of the bronze-clad Achaeans is my equal’, but goes on, ‘in war; but there are those who are better in assembly’. On the other hand, when Megabyzus the Persian visited Apelles’ studio and tried to start a conversation about art, Apelles shut him up by saying, ‘As long as you kept quiet, you seemed to be someone because of your golden jewellery and purple-dyed clothes, but now even these lads here who grind the pigment are laughing at you for talking nonsense.’  
      <br>&emsp;Now, although people might think, when they hear the Stoic description of the sage not only as wise, moral and courageous, but also as an orator, poet and military commander, as possessing wealth and as a king, that they are joking, nevertheless they expect all these descriptions for themselves and are annoyed if they don’t get them. Yet even different gods have different functions – one being called the god of battle, another the god of prophecy, another the god of profit; and Aphrodite is ordained by Zeus to preside over marriage and sex, precisely because her domain does not include military matters.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that some pursuits inherently do not go together, but rather tend in opposite directions. For instance, rhetorical training and the acquisition of intellectual disciplines need freedom and no pressure, but political power and intimacy with kings do not accrue without one being busy and using up one’s time. Moreover, ‘drinking wine and overeating meat may make the body strong and robust, but they weaken the mind’; and whereas constant concern and care for money increase affluence, yet disdain and scorn for money constitute an important resource for philosophy. So not everything is for everyone: one should follow the Delphic inscription and know oneself, and then engage in the single activity for which one is naturally suited; and one should avoid forcibly and unnaturally compelling oneself to envy alternative ways of life – and different ones at different times. ‘A horse is harnessed to a cart, an ox to a plough; a dolphin darts with great rapidity by a ship; and whoever plans death for a boar must find a courageous dog.’  
      <br>&emsp;Anyone, however, who is upset and distressed because he is not simultaneously a lion, ‘mountain-reared, confident in his might’, and a little Maltese dog protected in the lap of a widow, is crazy – but no crazier than anyone who wants to be Empedocles, Plato or Democritus, writing about the universe and the way things really are, and at the same time a Euphorion, with a rich older woman for a lover, or a Medius, hobnobbing with Alexander as one of his drinking companions, and gets irritated and distressed if he isn’t an Ismenias, admired for his affluence, and an Epaminondas, admired for his goodness. I mean, runners aren’t discontented because they don’t win the wrestling competition: they find pride and satisfaction in their own prizes. ‘You have obtained Sparta, so do it credit.’ And, as Solon says, ‘We will not exchange our virtue for their wealth, since the one is stable, but different people have money at different times.’  
      <br>&emsp;When Strato, the natural philosopher, was told that Menedemus’ students far outnumbered his, he said, ‘What else would you expect? There are bound to be more people who want to bathe than want to put oil on their bodies.’ And Aristotle wrote to Antipater, ‘The fact that Alexander rules over a lot of people does not make him the only one who can legitimately feel proud: anyone whose thinking about the gods is correct has just as much right.’ The point is that people who value what they have, as in these stories, are not upset by whatever anyone else they come across has. But what happens at the moment is that although we do not expect a vine to produce figs or an olive to produce grapes, yet if we don’t have the advantages of both plutocrats and scholars, military commanders and philosophers, flatterers and those who speak their minds, misers and big spenders, all at once, we bully ourselves, are dissatisfied with ourselves, and despise ourselves as living deficient and unfulfilled lives.  
      <br>&emsp;In addition, there are also clear reminders from nature. Different animals have been differently equipped by nature to provide for themselves: they have not all been made carnivores or seed-peckers or root-diggers. In the same way, nature has granted a wide variety of means of living to human beings – ‘to shepherd, ploughman, bird-catcher and to the man whose livelihood comes from the sea’. What we should do, then, is choose what suits our specific natures, work at it and forget others’ occupations; in other words, we should not show up any deficiency in Hesiod’s assertion that ‘Potter is jealous of potter, builder of builder.’ I mean, people do not try to emulate only others with the same profession and same way of life; instead, rich men envy scholars and are in turn envied by famous people, while lawyers envy professional orators and – strange though it may seem – free men and aristocrats are utterly in awe of what they see as the happiness of comic actors in successful plays, and of dancers and servants in the royal courts. The result is that they distress and discompose themselves a great deal.  
      <br>&emsp;It is clear from the differences between people’s experiences that everyone has within himself the resources which may lead to contentment or discontent – the jars of good and bad do not sit ‘on Zeus’ threshold’, but lie in our minds. Foolish people overlook and ignore good things even when they are present, because their thoughts are always straining towards the future; intelligent people, on the other hand, use their memories to keep them vivid for themselves even when they are no longer present. Anything present is accessible for the minutest fraction of time and then escapes perception, and consequently foolish people think that it ceases to be relevant to us, or ceases to be ours. There is a painting of a man in Hades weaving a rope, who lets it out to a donkey at pasture, which eats up what he is weaving; in exactly the same way, most people succumb to blind, ungrateful oblivion, which consumes them and leaves no trace of any event, any moment of success, pleasant relaxation, interaction or delight.  
      <br>&emsp;This oblivion prevents life being a unity of past events woven with present ones: it divides yesterday from today, as if they were distinct, and likewise treats tomorrow as different from today, and it immediately consigns every occurrence to non-existence by never making use of memory. The school of thought which eliminates growth on the assumption that being is in constant flux makes each person, in theory, different from himself, and then different again; similarly, those who don’t use memory to protect or recover what has gone before, but let it trickle away, day by day, make themselves in fact incomplete and empty and in suspense for the day to follow, as if the events of last year, the recent past and yesterday had no bearing on them or, in short, didn’t happen to them.  
      <br>&emsp;So this is another thing that unsettles contentment, but not as much as the next factor we must consider. You know how when flies settle on mirrors, they skid off the smooth parts but cling on to places which are rough and scratched; this is an analogy for how people slide away from happy, congenial matters and get caught up in their memories of unpleasant things. An even better analogy might be based on the story that in Olynthus there is a place (called ‘Beetle-death’) which beetles fall into and are unable to get out of: they go round and round in circles until they die there. Likewise, without noticing it, people slip into recalling their bad times and are unwilling to revive or resuscitate themselves.  
      <br>&emsp;What we should do is treat the mind like a painting, and the events the mind recalls like the colours, and so give prominence to what is bright and vivid, and push anything gloomy into the obscurity of the background. I mean, it is impossible to eradicate and exclude the gloomy aspects altogether: ‘The world is fitted together by interchange between opposites, as are a lyre and a bow’, and nothing in human life is pure and unalloyed. In music there are low notes and high notes, and in grammar there are vowels and consonants, and musicianship and literacy do not come from disliking and avoiding one or the other extreme, but from knowing how to make use of them all, and how to blend them into an appropriate mixture. Events too contain polarity: as Euripides says, ‘Good and bad are inseparable, but blending is possible, to make things fine.’ So, to continue our simile, we should not get discontented or give up when faced with discrepancy, but should behave like expert musicians: if someone plays bad music, they lessen its impact by playing better music, and they enclose wrong notes within right ones. So we should make our life’s mixture harmonious and congruent with ourselves.  
      <br>&emsp;I mean, Menander is wrong when he says, ‘From the moment of birth onwards, everyone is attended by a deity, who is an excellent guide through the mysteries of life.’ Empedocles is more likely to be right with his view that each of us has two destinies or deities, which take us in hand and into their power when we are born: ‘Earth was there, and far-seeing Sun, bloody Discord and tranquil Harmony, Beauty and Ugliness, Speed and Slowness, fair Truth and dark-locked Doubt.’ [] Consequently, since at birth we admitted, all together, the potential for each of these experiences, and since we therefore inherently contain plenty of inconsistencies, anyone with any sense prays for the better things, but expects the others as well, and copes with both sets by never behaving excessively. For, in the first place, as Epicurus says, ‘Increased pleasure in approaching the future depends on decreased need of it’; and in the second place, increased enjoyment of wealth, fame, power and status depends on decreased dread of their opposites, in the sense that a strong desire for each of them instils a very strong fear of their departure, and so weakens and destabilizes the pleasure, as if it were a candle flame in a draught. Anyone whom rationality allows to stand up to fortune fearlessly and unflinchingly, and say, ‘ “You are welcome if you bring a gift, and no great ordeal if you leave” ’, is enabled by his courage and fearlessness (because he knows that its departure would not be unbearable) thoroughly to enjoy whatever his present situation is. When Anaxagoras’ son died, he declared, ‘I knew that ‘I had fathered a mortal’; and it is possible not to stop at admiring his character, which enabled him to say this, but also to mirror him by saying, whenever fortune intrudes, ‘I know that the wealth I have is transitory and unstable’; ‘I know that I owe my position to people who have the power to remove it’; ‘I know that although my wife is good, she is a woman, and that my friend is human – a member of an inherently inconstant species, as Plato remarked.’  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that, if anything happens which may be unwelcome, but is not unexpected, this kind of preparedness and character leaves no room for ‘I couldn’t have imagined it’ and ‘This isn’t what I’d hoped for’ and ‘I didn’t expect this’, and so stops the heart lurching and beating fast and so on, and quickly settles derangement and disturbance back on to a foundation. Carneades used to remind people who were involved in important affairs that unexpectedness is the be-all and end-all of distress and discontent. Consider, for example, how much smaller the Macedonian kingdom was than the Roman empire. Nevertheless, when Perseus lost Macedonia, not only did he complain bitterly about his own destiny, but it was universally held that his misfortune and fate were worse than absolutely everyone else’s; but when Aemilius (who had defeated Perseus) resigned from his position of controlling more or less all the lands and seas in the world, he was fêted and he performed sacrifices to the gods for his acknowledged happiness. There was a good reason for this: Aemilius had accepted a position knowing that he would one day pass it on, whereas Perseus had lost his position unexpectedly. Homer too makes some good points about what happens when things are unexpected: Odysseus wept when his dog greeted him, but sat down impassively next to his sobbing wife; the reason is that he reached his wife with his emotions tamed and controlled by rational foresight, but he fell into the other situation without anticipating it – its surprising nature made it come out of the blue. [  
      <br>&emsp;To express the matter generally, while some unwelcome events do by their very nature entail distress and pain, nevertheless, where the majority of such events are concerned, it is our minds that condition and teach us to resent them. Therefore, when faced with this latter category of unwelcome events, it is useful always to have available Menander’s line, which says, ‘No experience is terrible unless you make it so.’ He is implicitly asking the question: Unless your body or mind are actually affected, what difference does it make to you if, for example, your father was not an aristocrat, your wife is having an affair, you fail to win some prize or you lose your right to the front seats in the theatre? For these occurrences do not stop a man being in excellent physical or mental condition. And where the former events are concerned, the ones which do seem by their very nature to cause distress – such as illness, stress and a friend’s or child’s death – then there is Euripides’ famous line: ‘I say “Poor me!” – but why? I am only experiencing what it is to be human.’ You see, no rational argument checks the downward slide of our emotions as well as one which reminds us that, in common with others and thanks to our nature, there are things which we cannot avoid; this necessity, which is due to corporeality, affords fortune its only hold on human beings; but corporeality is just one part of man’s mixed nature, and in his most authoritative and important aspects he remains secure and stable.  
      <br>&emsp;When Demetrius had captured Megara, he asked Stilpo whether anything of his had been looted; Stilpo replied that he had seen nothing being carried off about which he would want to say ‘mine’. So, if fortune steals and removes from us everything else, we still have something in us which is such that ‘the Achaeans cannot carry or take it away’. It follows that we should not completely belittle and denigrate our nature as being weak, unstable and entirely subject to fortune; on the contrary, we know that the part of man which is flawed and unsound (and so liable to fortune) is small, and that we ourselves control the better part, which safely contains the most important of our benefits – correct beliefs, things we have learned and arguments conducive to goodness – which therefore subsist indelibly and indestructibly. If we are aware of this, the future doesn’t dismay or terrify us and, where fortune is concerned, we say what Socrates said to the jurors (though he was apparently addressing his prosecutors) – that Anytus and Meletus can kill him, but not harm him.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that fortune can make us fall ill, can deprive us of our wealth, can ruin our relationship with the people or the king, but it cannot make someone who is good, brave and high-minded into a bad, cowardly, mean-spirited, petty and spiteful person, and it cannot deprive us of the permanent presence of an attitude towards life which is a more helpful guide in this sphere than a helmsman is on a sea voyage. A helmsman is incapable of quelling a rough sea or the wind, and he cannot at will happen upon a safe harbour when he needs one, and he cannot endure whatever happens confidently and without flinching: as long as he doesn’t give up, and relies on his skill, ‘he escapes the hell-dark sea by reefing the mainsail right down to the bottom of the mast’, but when the waves loom over him, he sits there quaking and trembling. On the other hand, a wise person’s attitude calms the majority of physical matters, since his self-control, responsible regimen and moderate exercise get rid of the preconditions of illness; and if some external source of infection crops up, like the onset of a squall, then, in Asclepiades’ words, ‘he furls and lightens the sail, and rides it out’; and if some major unpredictable event overtakes and overwhelms him, the harbour is close by – he can swim away from the uncaulked hull of his body.  
      <br>&emsp;You see, it is not desire for life, but fear of death which makes an unintelligent person depend on his body and grasp on to it (one is reminded of how Odysseus’ fear of Charybdis below him made him grasp on to the fig tree), ‘when winds make both stopping and sailing impossible’, and he is dissatisfied with one option and afraid of the other. However, anyone who has come, by whatever route, to understand the nature of the mind, and who appreciates that at death the change the mind undergoes is either for the better or at least not for the worse, is well equipped by this lack of fear of death to be content about his life. Anyone who can not only enjoy life when the pleasant and congenial aspect of it is uppermost, but who, when faced with an excess of events which are antipathetic and incongruent with his nature, can also depart without fear and with the words, ‘The god himself will free me, when I will it’ – well, it is inconceivable that such a man could be annoyed or angry or upset by anything that happened to him.  
      <br>&emsp;Whoever it was who said, ‘Fortune, I have made a pre-emptive strike against you, and I have deprived you of every single loophole’, was not basing his confidence on bolts, locks and fortifications, but on principles and arguments which are available to anyone who wants them. And this kind of argument should not induce any degree of resignation or disbelief, but admiration, emulation, enthusiasm, and investigation and observation of oneself in relatively trivial circumstances, to prepare oneself for the more important matters, so that one does not avoid them or divert one’s mind from attention to them or take refuge in excuses like ‘That’s probably the most difficult thing I’ll ever come across.’ For if the mind is self-indulgent, and takes the easiest courses all the time, and retreats from unwelcome matters to what maximizes its pleasure, the consequence is weakness and feebleness born of lack of exertion; but a mind which trains and strains itself to use rationality to conceive an image of illness and pain and exile will find that there is plenty of unreality, superficiality and unsoundness in the apparent problems and horrors each of them has to offer, as detailed rational argument demonstrates.  
      <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, even the line of Menander which goes ‘It is impossible for anyone still living to say, “That won’t happen to me” ’ produces a shiver of fear in many people; but this is because they are unaware to what extent distress can be avoided by the beneficial practice of training oneself to gain the ability to look straight at fortune with open eyes, and not to form in oneself images which are ‘soft and unweathered’, like someone who has been brought up away from sunlight, in the shade of numerous hopes which constantly give way and provide no resistance against anything. However, we can also say the same thing as Menander – ‘It is impossible for anyone still living to say, “That won’t happen to me” ’ – but add that it is possible for anyone still living to say, ‘Here’s what I will not do: I will not lie, I will not mislead, I will not steal, I will not intrigue.’ For this lies ready to hand, within our power, and its contribution towards contentment is not inconsiderable, but huge, since the alternative is for ‘the realization of knowing that I have committed crimes’ to mark the mind with remorse, which continually bleeds and stings like a bodily wound.  
      <br>&emsp;You see, while all other discomforts are eradicated by reason, it is reason itself which creates remorse, when the mind with its conscience is pricked and punished by itself. People who shiver from a chill or feel hot from a fever are more troubled and worse off than people who have the same sensations because of external heat or cold; likewise, chance events entail distress which is easier to endure, because it comes from an external source; but when ‘What has happened to me is no one else’s fault but my own’ is the lament over one’s mistakes, then because it comes from an internal source, from oneself, the result is a pain which one’s sense of shame makes harder to bear. This is why a magnificent house, massive wealth, a splendid genealogy and high office, eloquence and fluency, are all incapable of giving life the degree of fair and calm weather that is afforded by a mind which is untainted by bad actions and intentions, and which bases life on a character that is calm and clear. A character like this is a fountain-head of fine achievements which entail not only present activity that is exuberant and happy and a source of pride, but also past memories that are more rewarding and secure than hopes which, as Pindar says, ‘sustain one in old age’. Carneades said, ‘Even if thuribles have been cleared out, they emit their scent for a long time.’ And is it not the case that fine deeds leave behind in an intelligent person’s mind an impression which remains pleasant and fresh, and thanks to which happiness is irrigated and thrives and he is enabled to rise above the level of those who moan and complain about life as being a vale of tears or a place designated for our soul’s exile down here?  
      <br>&emsp;I like Diogenes’ quip: once when he was visiting Sparta, he saw his host zealously getting ready for a festival day, and he said, ‘Isn’t it the mark of a good man to regard every day as a festival day?’ And a particularly glorious festival too, if we see things aright. The world is a temple of the highest sacredness, and nowhere could be more suitable for divinity; and man is introduced into this world by means of his birth not to view manufactured, immobile images, but to gaze upon what Plato describes as the perceptible likenesses of intelligible things which divine intelligence has manifested as containers of an inherent principle of life and movement – the sun, moon and stars, the rivers with their continuous discharge of renewed water, and the earth with its supply of means of nourishment for plants and creatures. Life is an initiation into these things and there is no more perfect way to celebrate them; life, therefore, should be full of contentment and joy, and we should not make the usual mistake of waiting for occasional days like the holidays sacred to Cronus, Zeus or Athena for the opportunity to enjoy and revivify ourselves by paying mimes and dancers for bought entertainment.  
      <br>&emsp;Moreover, although we sit quietly and in good order on these occasions – for no one complains while he is being initiated or whinges while he is watching the Pythian Games or is drinking during the festival of Cronus – nevertheless, people bring shame on the festivals, which are arranged and conducted by God, by spending most of the rest of their time in complaints, despondency and exhausting worry. And although people enjoy listening to the delightful sounds of musical instruments and the singing of birds, and enjoy watching the play and frolics of animals, and conversely get perturbed when they growl and roar and look threatening, nevertheless when they see that their own lives are unsmiling, depressed and constantly constrained and restricted by disagreeable experiences and events and innumerable anxieties, they are unwilling to find some means of supplying themselves with recuperation and relaxation. But even when other people try to assist, they resist any argument which could help them come to terms with their current situation without finding fault with it, remember the past without ingratitude and approach the future happily and optimistically, without fear and without apprehension.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="Flatterers">
      It is true, Antiochus Philopappus, that Plato says a high degree of self-love is universally forgiven; but he also says that it engenders a very serious flaw (not to mention the multitude of lesser flaws) – namely, there is no way that a person in love with himself can make a fair and impartial assessment of himself. Unless education has accustomed one to prefer goodness, and to make this one’s goal, rather than what is inbred and innate, then ‘Love is blind where the beloved is concerned’. This lays the domain of love or friendship wide open to the flatterer; self-love provides him with a perfect base camp against us, since self-love makes each person his own primary and chief self-flatterer, and makes it easy for us to allow someone else under our guard – someone else to testify to and corroborate and support us in our beliefs and aspirations. To call anyone, as an insult, ‘fond of flattery’ is to say that he is excessively in love with himself, since his fondness for himself leads him not just to aspire to everything, but to believe that he already has everything: the aspiration is not odd, but the belief is treacherous and needs a great deal of caution.  
      <br>&emsp;If truth is indeed divine and is the source, in Plato’s words, ‘of all good things for gods and all for men’, then the flatterer is likely to be inimical to the gods and especially to the Pythian god, since a flatterer is perpetually ranged in opposition to the saying ‘Know yourself’: he instils in everyone self-deceit and ignorance both of oneself and of those things which are good and bad for oneself – he makes the former impossible to achieve and accomplish, and the latter impossible to rectify.  
      <br>&emsp;Now, if a flatterer were like most other bad things and exclusively or largely seized on the dregs and dross of mankind, he would not be so terrible or hard to resist; but just as it is soft, sweet woods that woodworms prefer to penetrate, so it is generous, good and fair characters which admit and nourish the parasitic flatterer. Besides, as Simonides says, ‘It is not with Zacynthus that horse-farming goes, but with fertile fields’: it is noticeably no different in the case of flattery, which steers clear of poverty, obscurity and ineffectuality, and traps and infects mighty houses and weighty affairs, and not uncommonly deposes kings and rulers. It follows that trying to ensure that flattery is ferreted out before it harms or corrupts friendship is not an unimportant task and requires considerable forethought. Lice leave a dying person and abandon his body when the blood which nourishes them dries up, and the chances of seeing flatterers involved in business which has no sap or warmth are minimal, but they cling to reputation and authority and they flourish there – until things change, when they waste no time in slithering away. It is important, however, that one does not just wait for that experience, which is at the best pointless, and is more likely to be hurtful and even dangerous, in the sense that the realization, at precisely the time when one needs friends, that they are no friends is hard to endure, since there is no chance then of exchanging the unreliable, counterfeit friend for one who is good and reliable. No, the friend that you have, just like the coin in your pocket, should have been assayed before the need arises, rather than being tested by the need when it arises. The realization ought not to occur because we have been hurt; we ought to have already acquainted ourselves with and observed the flatterer, and so avoid being hurt. Otherwise, our experience will be no different from that of people who realize the facts about lethal drugs by sampling them first: death by suicide is the price they pay for their conclusion.  
      <br>&emsp;This attitude is not the only type we cannot commend: there are also people whose premiss is that friendship is fine and useful, and whose conclusion is that those who are pleasing company are thereby self-evidently guilty of being flatterers. But a friend does not have to be unpleasant or unpalatable, nor does friendship gain its significance by being harsh and uninviting: it is rather the case that it is pleasant and attractive precisely because it is fine and significant. ‘Its neighbours are the Graces and Desire’, and it is not only for someone who is down on his luck that, in Euripides’ words, ‘it is pleasing to look into the eyes of a kindly man’: where friendship is present, it brings pleasure and joy in good times to the same degree that it removes the pain and confusion of bad times. On the analogy of Evenus’ maxim that the best relish is the cooking-fire, God’s fusion of friendship with life makes everything heart-warming, pleasing and attractive, since friendship is there as a partner in the pleasure.  
      <br>&emsp;There is no possible explanation why the flatterer disguises himself in pleasing masks, except that he has noticed that friendship never excludes pleasure. But just as fool’s gold and counterfeits imitate only gold’s gleam and sheen, so the flatterer can be seen as imitating the pleasant and attractive aspects of friendship, always putting on a cheerful, vivacious face and never being negative or recalcitrant. But it is false to conclude from this that people who praise others are immediately to be suspected simply of flattering them: when either is called for, approval and disapproval are equally appropriate within friendship – or rather, although captiousness and disparagement are inevitably inimical to friendship and compatibility, we are still perfectly content to put up with criticism and someone speaking their mind, provided there have been earlier manifestations of kindliness unstintingly and enthusiastically expressing approval of deeds well done; and the reason we are content to do this is because we trust – with no hint of anxiety – that anyone who is happy to express approval expresses disapproval only when compelled to do so.  
      <br>&emsp;At this point someone might comment that it is difficult to distinguish the flatterer and the friend, since they both equally provide pleasure and express approval; in fact, it is noticeable that flattery often outdoes friendship in favours and acts of service. We will reply as follows: of course it is difficult, because we are after the genuine flatterer, the one who approaches the matter cunningly and artfully; we are not falling into the usual trap of regarding as flatterers those who carry their own oil-flasks (as the epithet goes), those spongers and scroungers whose voices (as someone has put it) are heard only once hands have been washed for dinner, and whose vulgarity, with its concomitant sarcasm and rudeness, becomes obvious before the first course and first drink are over. For there never could be the slightest point in investigating Melanthius, the parasite of Alexander of Pherae, who replied, whenever he was asked how Alexander had been killed, ‘Through the ribs and into my stomach’; or those who besiege a well-endowed table, whom ‘neither fire nor iron nor bronze prevents from turning up regularly for a meal’; or those female flatterers from Cyprus who, having travelled across to Syria, earned the name of ‘ladderettes’ for bending over and allowing the royal women to use them for climbing into their carriages.  
      <br>&emsp;Of whom, then, ought one to be careful? Of the person who does not appear to be a flatterer, and does not let on that he is; who cannot be found near the kitchen or be caught counting the minutes before dinner; who does not fall about drunk all over the place, but is invariably sober; who sticks his nose into everything and thinks that he ought to be involved in things and wants to be privy to secrets – in short, of the man who acts the part of friend in a serious manner rather than comically or farcically. As Plato says, ‘The ultimate dishonesty is the false appearance of honesty’: it is not overt, light-hearted flattery that must be regarded as problematic, but the covert, straight-faced version, which can corrupt even true friendship if we do not watch out, because its behaviour coincides to a large extent with that of friendship.  
      <br>&emsp;When Gobryas tumbled into a dark room along with the Magus he was chasing and found himself entwined with his opponent, he told Darius, who was near by and did not know what to do, to use his sword, even if it wounded both of them. We, however, can never under any circumstances at all condone the attitude of ‘Never mind what happens to a friend, just so long as an enemy suffers’; so if we want to rid ourselves of the flatterer, then, given that he is intertwined with the friend by many threads of similarity, we ought to be exceedingly careful that we do not somehow either throw out the good with the bad or open our doors to danger by indulging what we feel comfortable with. I imagine that when uncultivated seeds which are nearly the same shape and size get mixed up with wheat, it makes cleaning the wheat difficult, because a fine sieve does not eliminate the seeds, and a wide sieve eliminates both the seeds and the wheat; it is just the same with flattery, which is hard to separate from friendship because it has infiltrated every one of our moods, activities, needs and habits.  
      <br>&emsp;However, it is because friendship is the most gratifying thing in the world and nothing affords one more pleasure, that the flatterer’s domain is pleasure and pleasure is what he uses as bait. And it is because goodwill and service are inseparable from friendship (hence the saying that a friend is more essential than fire and water), that the flatterer undertakes tasks and tries hard always to appear well-meaning, determined and enthusiastic. And since the chief factor in forging friendship at the beginning is similarity of interests and attitudes, and enjoying and avoiding the same things is usually the initial bond which brings people together, through affinity, then because the flatterer is well aware of all this, he patterns and forms himself as if he were some kind of material, in an attempt to match and mirror whoever he plans to beset by means of imitation; and he is so malleable and plausible in his mimicry that he provokes the comment: ‘You are no son of Achilles, but the man himself!’ However, the most iniquitous aspect of all his iniquity is that, because he has noticed that speaking one’s mind is both claimed and believed to be a mode of speech specific to friendship – just as animals make specific sounds – and that someone who avoids speaking his mind is held to be unfriendly and unforthcoming, then he proceeds to imitate this too; just as skilful cooks use sharp and bitter flavours as seasonings to get rid of the cloying nature of sweet foods, so flatterers employ a candour which is false and does no good, but is, so to speak, no more than a wink and a tickle.  
      <br>&emsp;These are the reasons, then, that the man is hard to spot: he is like one of those animals which can naturally change their colour so as to be assimilated with the shrubs and environment around them. But because his imposture and invisibility are based on similarities, it is our job to use discrepancies to reveal him and expose him for, in Plato’s words, ‘embellishing himself with others’ colours and forms through lack of any personal to himself’.  
      <br>&emsp;We should, therefore, begin the inquiry right from the beginning. As already mentioned, the beginning of friendship is invariably when temperament and nature are so much in unison that they cleave to habits and attitudes which are, within reason, identical, and enjoy the same interests, activities and pastimes. It has even been said, concerning this unison: ‘An old man most enjoys the voice of another old man, a child that of a child; woman is in concord with woman, invalid with invalid, and one overtaken by disaster enchants another in tribulation.’ So, because the flatterer knows that if people enjoy the same things they are bound to form a relationship and take pleasure in each other’s company, his first tactic for getting close to a given individual and pitching tent near him is as follows: he treats it like an exercise in breaking in animals, and patiently makes his approach (by means of the same interests, pastimes, pursuits and occupations) and finally strokes his quarry, and keeps at it until the other submits and becomes docile and accustomed to his touch. The flatterer criticizes the activities, ways of life and people he sees the subject disliking, and is extravagant in his praise for whatever the other likes, to ensure that he is seen to express more than his share of astonishment and incredulity; and he insists that his likes and dislikes are carefully thought out rather than being emotional reactions.  
      <br>&emsp;So, given that we are dealing with no actual similarity or even potential similarity, and that this is all just camouflage, how can we put the flatterer to the test? What actual discrepancies are there, in which he can be ensnared? Above all, one should see whether his intention is consistent and constant, whether he always enjoys the same things, approves of the same things and guides and organizes his life with regard to a single model, which is proper behaviour for someone who is autonomous and who desires friendship and familiarity with a like-minded person. If he does all this, he is a friend. On the other hand, since the flatterer has no single foundation for his attitudes as a source of stability and his way of life is not of his own choosing but is derived from someone else, and since he moulds and adjusts himself by reference to someone else, then he is not straightforward or single, but complex and multifaceted; he is always streaming from one place to another (like water in the process of being poured) and the only form he has is given by the vessels that receive him.  
      <br>&emsp;A horned owl, apparently, is caught as it tries to copy a human being and move and dance along with him; a flatterer, on the other hand, is the one who inveigles others and leads them into the trap, by playing a variety of parts: he dances and sings with one person, but wrestles and rolls in the dust with another. If he has caught someone who is keen on stalking and hunting, he joins in and comes close to bellowing out Phaedra’s lines, ‘Oh, how I adore hallooing the hounds when I’m hot on the heels of the dappled deer’, and is not in the slightest concerned with the beast, but enmeshes and traps the hunter himself. If he is after a studious young academic, he changes tack, surrounds himself with books and lets his beard grow down to his feet; arrayed in the requisite threadbare cloak and indifference to the world, he spouts mathematics and Platonic right-angled triangles. If an idler bursts into his life, a rich carouser, he changes again, ‘and cunning Odysseus divests himself of his rags’: the cloak is discarded, the beard is pruned like an unproductive fruit-tree, and their place is taken by wine-coolers, drinking-bowls, conversations laced with laughter, jokes at the expense of philosophers.  
      <br>&emsp;It was just the same, as the story goes, in Syracuse during Plato’s visit, when Dionysius was seized by an intense passion for philosophy: the palace was filled with clouds of dust raised by the hordes of geometers. After Plato’s ‘impertinence’, however, when Dionysius had rejected philosophy and rushed back to wine, women, trivial conversation and sensuality, it was as if Circe had transformed them all: everyone without exception was overtaken by uncultured oblivion and foolishness. The point is further illustrated by the actions of the greatest flatterers and demagogues, of whom the most outstanding was Alcibiades: in Athens, he had fun, bred horses and lived a witty and elegant life; in Sparta, he had a crew cut, wore a thin cloak and washed in cold water; in Thrace, he drank and was aggressive; and when he arrived at Tissaphernes’ court, he adopted the soft life of luxurious indulgence and pretension. By this process of assimilation and adaptation, he kept on ingratiating himself with everyone and currying their favour. People like Epaminondas and Agesilaus provide the contrast; they interacted with a great many people, cultures and lifestyles, but they never failed to preserve their own character in the ways they dressed, behaved, spoke and lived. Likewise, Plato in Syracuse was no different from Plato in the Academy, and Dionysius saw the same man that Dion did. 
      <br>&emsp;It is very easy to expose the octopus-like transformations of the flatterer: all you have to do is appear to be mutable yourself, by criticizing a lifestyle you previously commended and by suddenly embracing activities, behaviour and language you had deplored. You will see that the flatterer has no constancy, that he is not his own man and that his likes and dislikes, pleasure and distress, are not aroused by innate feeling, but that he resembles a mirror: the only reflections he admits are those of external feelings, lifestyles and actions. Here is an example of his behaviour: if you criticize one of your friends to him, he says, ‘It took you a long time to see through him; I’ve never liked him.’ And if you later change your mind and you compliment your friend, he will – though it defies belief – say that he’s glad too and vicariously grateful for your compliment and that he trusts your friend. And if you say that you need to change your way of life, for instance from political service to quiet inactivity, he says, ‘Yes, we’re long overdue for a break from ructions and rivalries.’ And if you later give the impression of being strongly inclined towards activity and oratory, his response is: ‘There’s a project worthy of you! It’s nice to do nothing, but it doesn’t bring fame or recognition.’ We must lose no time in saying to someone like that: ‘ “Stranger, you now seem to me different from before.” I have no need of a friend who changes place when I do and nods in agreement when I do; my shadow is better at that. I need a friend who helps me by telling the truth and having discrimination.’  
      <br>&emsp;So that is one type of test that can be applied, but we must also watch out for a second discrepancy when he is imitating someone else. A genuine friend does not imitate everything or praise everything enthusiastically: he approves only of the best things. As Sophocles says, ‘He was born for mutual love, not mutual hatred’ – and, without a doubt, for mutual integrity and conscientiousness, not for mutual deviance and connivance. The only exception is if, just as eye infections can spread, he is unconsciously contaminated with a defect or imperfection by some contagious discharge, simply because of his proximity to and association with the source. This, of course, explains why (as the stories go) Plato’s associates used to copy his slumped shoulders, Aristotle’s his lisp, King Alexander’s his cocked head and harsh conversational tone: some people unconsciously get most of their characteristics from others’ attitudes and styles.  
      <br>&emsp;A flatterer, however, behaves exactly like a chameleon. A chameleon can assimilate itself to every colour except white; a flatterer leaves nothing contemptible unimitated, because he is altogether incapable of making himself resemble anything worth ascribing importance to. Just as inferior artists, who lack the skill to achieve beautiful results, summon up representations of their subjects by resorting to wrinkles and moles and scars, so a flatterer imitates lack of self-control, superstition, rage, severity towards servants, mistrust of kith and kin. This is because he is innately inclined towards the worse sides of a person; and the fact that he imitates despicable behaviour means that he avoids a reputation for being critical of it, since it is people who strive for improvement who are suspected of being disappointed and aggrieved at their friends’ mistakes. This is why Dion, Samius and Cleomenes, in their relationships respectively with Dionysius, Philip and Ptolemy, fell from grace and were killed. But anyone who wants to be, and also wants to be seen to be, good-tempered and trustworthy at the same time puts on an overdone display of enjoying the worse sides of a person, the implicit message being that his overwhelming fondness for the other person makes him tolerate even his less desirable aspects and share his feelings and inherent attitudes towards everything. That is why such people assume that they should be involved even in unchosen, chance events: they flatter people who are ill by pretending to have the same illness; if they are in the company of people who are partially blind or deaf, they pretend to be unable to see or hear well, just as when Dionysius’ sight was weak, his flatterers used to bump into one another and drop their plates during meals. Some prefer emotional contact as a means of infiltrating themselves further, and they go so far as to use secrets to make their feelings indistinguishable from the other person’s. If they see cases of ill-starred marriage or of mistrust of sons or family, they moan unstintingly about their own children or wife or relatives or family and let drop some secret reasons for the problem, because affinity makes people emotionally close, and if someone has been trusted with a secret, he is more inclined to disclose a secret of his own; and once he has made such a disclosure, a relationship has been formed and there is fear of loss of trust. I personally know someone who even threw his wife out because a friend of his had dismissed his wife (but the friend’s wife got at the facts, and he was discovered to be surreptitiously visiting his wife and writing to her!). It is obvious that anyone who thinks that the following riddle refers only to a crab and not to a flatterer knows nothing about flattery: ‘With a body which is nothing but stomach and with eyes that peer in all directions, a creature that scuttles on claws.’ This is a perfect description of a parasite – ‘of those whose friendship extends from frying-pan to meal end’, as Eupolis puts it.  
      <br>&emsp;However, this is not the proper part of the discussion for these remarks. What we must do now is not overlook a particular device the flatterer uses when imitating others: if he does imitate any of the good points of the person he is flattering, he makes sure that the balance is in favour of the other person. True friends are not rivals and do not envy one another: whether or not one is as successful as the other, he reacts with even temper and equanimity. The flatterer, however, is constantly aware that he is the understudy, and so, even while imitating the other person, he makes himself less than equal, insisting all the time that he is inferior and defective in every respect except for badness. Where bad features are concerned, he does not let anyone take first place away from him: if the other person is grumpy, he calls himself depressive; if the other person is superstitious, he calls himself spellbound; if the other person is in love, he calls himself besotted. ‘Your laughter was excessive,’ he says, ‘but I nearly died laughing.’ Where good features are concerned, however, it is the other way round: he says that although he is a fast runner, the other person zooms along; that he is a reasonably good horseman, ‘but no match for this Centaur here’. Or ‘I’m a natural poet, and the verse I write is pretty good, “but causing thunder is Zeus’ job, not mine”.’ What is happening is that he is intending to demonstrate simultaneously the irreproachability of the other person’s predilections, by imitating them, and the invincibility of the other person’s abilities, by being outclassed.  
      <br>&emsp;Anyway, when he is imitating someone else, a flatterer’s discrepancies (which distinguish him from a friend) take that kind of form. But, as I have already mentioned, there is also the issue of pleasure, which is equally relevant to both the flatterer and the friend, because a good man enjoys his friends to the same degree that a bad man enjoys his flatterers. So we must proceed to make the distinction in this context too, and we find the distinction in referring the pleasure to its purpose. Look at it this way: perfume smells nice, of course, but so does medicine. The difference between them is that the one has no raison d’être except pleasure, while in the other case the fact that what counteracts impurities or chills or emaciation smells nice is neither here nor there. Or again, artists blend their paints into vivid hues and tinctures, and some medicinal potions are vivid to look at and appealing in colour. So what is the difference? It is surely obvious that we can distinguish them by their functional purpose.  
      <br>&emsp;In exactly the same way, although the charm of friendship is, so to speak, vivid as well as delightful when the issues are fine and beneficial, still there are times when friends interact by means of trivia, food, drink – even jokes and idle talk – which act as a kind of seasoning for the fine, important issues. This is the context of the line ‘They rejoiced in telling tales to one another’, and also the line ‘There is nothing else which could have separated us two in our mutual love and enjoyment.’ The function and purpose of the flatterer, however, is always to concoct and prepare some trivial event or expression, as if they were spicy sauces, with pleasure as the goal and objective. 
      <br>&emsp;In short, while the one thinks it is his duty to bend over backwards to be liked, the other always does his duty, and although he is often liked, he is often disliked too – not that he sets out to be disliked, but he does not refrain from it if it is the better course of action. If it helps patients improve, a doctor gives doses of saffron or spikenard and often even soothes them with baths and generously recommends nourishing foods; there are circumstances, on the other hand, in which he eschews these prescriptions and forces castor down the patient’s throat, ‘or hulwort, whose strong smell is disgusting’, or he pounds some hellebore and makes him drain the cup. In neither case, however, does he regard the distress or the pleasure as an end; both are means by which he single-mindedly guides his patients towards the goal of improvement. In exactly the same way, a friend sometimes spends all his time lionizing and delighting the other person, using praise and compliments to guide him towards goodness: examples are when someone said, ‘Teucer my dear friend, Telamon’s son, leader of your people – strike like this’, and ‘How, then, could I overlook godlike Odysseus?’ On the other hand, when severity is called for, a friend latches on to the other person with words that bite and candour that smacks of the guardian: ‘Menelaus, you may be protected by Zeus, but you’re out of your mind: there’s no need for such stupidity.’ There are also circumstances in which a friend acts as well as speaks his mind: Menedemus taught the son of his friend Asclepiades a lesson by locking out the degenerate, insubordinate young man without actually ticking him off, and Arcesilaus banned Baton from his school for composing verse mocking Cleanthes, and relented only when Baton had reassured Cleanthes and had had a change of heart.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that one should upset a friend only when it does him good, and should not let the upset destroy the friendship, but should use sharpness like a medicine, to preserve and protect the patient. This is why a friend is like a musician: in retuning his instrument for the mode of goodness and benefit, he loosens here and tightens there, and consequently, although he may often be likeable, he always does good. By contrast, because a flatterer is used to constantly playing his pleasing and likeable accompaniment in one mode only, he does not know how to use resistance or hard words: someone else’s preferences are his only guides and all the notes he sings or plays are in unison with that other person. We should, therefore, behave like Agesilaus, in Xenophon’s account, who was happy to be complimented by people who were also prepared to criticize him: we too should regard a pleasing and delightful nature as indicative of friendship only if it is accompanied by the ability to upset us and resist us, and we should be suspicious of a relationship which is constantly gratifying and which tends purely towards pleasure, with no admixture of hurt; and we most certainly ought to keep in mind the Spartan’s comment on praise of King Charillus: ‘Of course he’s not a good man: he doesn’t get cross even with bad people.’ 
      <br>&emsp;It is said that gadflies insert themselves into bulls’ ears and fleas into dogs’ ears; flatterers fill the ears of ambitious people with their expressions of approval and, having once become attached, are hard to scratch off. It follows that it is particularly important to have one’s discriminatory apparatus alert and checking whether the approval is for the man or for his behaviour. It is for the behaviour if they prefer to praise us in our absence rather than in our presence; if they share the same desires and ambitions themselves, and therefore do not restrict their approval to us, but praise everyone for the same behaviour; if they do not turn out to be inconsistent in what they say and do; and most importantly if we ourselves are conscious of no remorse for the behaviour for which we are being praised and of no embarrassment or hankering to have said or done the opposite (for if our innate conscience impugns and spurns the praise, then it is unaffected, untouchable and unassailable by the flatterer). Incredibly, [ however, not only do most people reject advice when they are out of luck and prefer to be surrounded by sorrow or grief, but also, when they transgress and do wrong, they regard as an enemy and a detractor anyone who uses reproof and criticism to instil qualms and contrition, while they embrace and regard as a well-meaning friend anyone who commends and praises them for their actions. People who readily praise and join in the applause for an action or sentiment or anything, whether seriously or humorously intended, are only fleetingly and immediately harmful; but those whose compliments reach a man’s character and whose flattery even touches his temperament are doing exactly what slaves do if they steal from the seed-corn rather than from the stock: since disposition and character are the seed of conduct, they are corrupting the foundation and source of a person’s life by clothing vice in words proper to virtue. 
      <br>&emsp;In times of civil and external wars, as Thucydides remarks, ‘They changed the way words had usually applied to behaviour, and justified the change: irrational foolhardiness was considered to be courage born of love for one’s comrades; circumspection was regarded as specious cowardice; self-restraint as a mask for gutlessness; the desire to understand everything as the desire to do nothing.’ And in cases of flattery we must watch and be wary of wastefulness being described as ‘generosity’, cowardice as ‘caution’, capriciousness as ‘quickness’, small-mindedness as ‘a sense of proportion’, a lustful person as ‘sociable and affectionate’, a short-tempered bully as ‘courageous’, a good-for-nothing lackey as ‘altruistic’. Likewise Plato says somewhere that a lover (who is a flatterer of his beloved) calls a snub nose ‘pert’, a hooked nose ‘aristocratic’, swarthy people ‘virile’ and pallid people ‘children of the gods’; and ‘honey-coloured’ is nothing but the invention of a lover trying to gloss over and make light of a sallow complexion. Still, if an ugly person is persuaded that he is good-looking, or a short person that he is well built, he does not have to live with the lie for a long time, and the wound is not deep or irremediable. But praise that conditions a person to treat vice as virtue – and to do so gladly, not reluctantly – and that does away with one’s sense of shame at wrong-doing, is the praise that brought the Sicilians low, by describing Dionysius’ and Phalaris’ cruelty as ‘righteous indignation’; and it is the praise that corrupted Egypt, by naming Ptolemy’s effeminacy, entrancement, chanting and striking of hand-drums ‘devotion’ and ‘worshipping the gods’; and it is the praise that came within a hair’s breadth of overturning and effacing what it was then to be Roman, by glossing over Antony’s promiscuous, self-indulgent and self-glorifying ways as the sparkling and genial fun of one blessed with unlimited power and good fortune. What else equipped Ptolemy with mouthpiece and pipes? What else supplied Nero with a tragic stage and dressed him in mask and actor’s boots? Was it not the praise of flatterers? In the majority of cases, isn’t a king called an Apollo if he can warble, a Dionysus when he is drunk, a Heracles for his wrestling? And isn’t it enjoyment of this flattery that diverts him into utterly scandalous behaviour?  
      <br>&emsp;It follows that approbation is the main aspect of the flatterer against which we must protect ourselves. But he is aware of this too, and is clever at protecting himself against suspicion. If he latches on to some overdressed swank or rustic innocent in a thick leather jacket, he indulges in all-out sarcasm, just like Strouthias when he tramples on Bias and gloats over his insensitivity with compliments like ‘You could drink King Alexander under the table’ and ‘I see you’re one up against the Cypriot – that’s rich!’; despite this, when he is dealing with more sophisticated people, he notices that this is the respect in which they particularly scrutinize him and that this is the region and area in which they are particularly on their guard, and so he does not deploy his praise in a frontal assault, but pulls it back a long way, performs an encircling movement and ‘makes as stealthy an approach as any animal’, brushing by in an experimental manner. On one occasion, he reports the compliments that others have been paying the person – like an orator availing himself of someone else’s personality – and explains how he had been delighted to have met in the agora some strangers or men of venerable age who had, in admiring tones, had many a complimentary tale to tell about him. On another occasion, he pursues the opposite course and the lies he invents consist of superficial complaints against the man – made up by the flatterer as if he had heard them from others: he rushes up to find out whether the imputed words or deeds really happened. The person denies it, of course, and then the flatterer jumps in and introduces his accolade: ‘I could hardly believe that you had abused one of your friends, when you’re constitutionally incapable of abusing even your enemies, or that you had been after someone else’s goods, when you’re so generous with your own.’ 
      <br>&emsp;Others behave like artists who enhance the light, bright parts of their paintings by juxtaposing them with shade and darkness; in much the same way, some flatterers implicitly approve and perpetuate their victims’ current flaws by depreciating and reviling, or ridiculing and mocking, the opposite qualities. If they are with spendthrifts, they denigrate restraint as provincial; if they are with greedy criminals, whose source of wealth is contemptible and evil practices, they denigrate self-sufficiency and morality as cowardice and ineffectiveness in the world; however, when they are in the company of idle layabouts who shun the limelight of politics, it causes them no embarrassment to describe political activity as ‘annoying interference’ and ambition as ‘pointless vainglory’. Furthermore, flattery of an orator might call for mocking a philosopher, and the way to gain prestige among loose women is to call monogamous and faithful wives ‘frigid and drab’.  
      <br>&emsp;Flatterers surpass themselves in amorality, however, in that they do not even go easy on themselves. Just as wrestlers prostrate themselves in order to trip others up, so flatterers worm their way into their neighbours’ admiration by self-criticism: ‘At sea, I’m a cowardly creature; I give up easily when faced with hard work; I can’t control my temper if someone slights me. But nothing,’ he goes on, ‘makes this man here afraid, and no task is too hard: he is extraordinary – he puts up with everything without anxiety or distress.’  
      <br>&emsp;Now imagine someone who thinks he is very clever, who sets out to be forthright and blunt – under the guise, of course, of integrity – and whose constant watchword is ‘Son of Tydeus, you must find the middle course between eulogizing me and maligning me.’ The skilful flatterer does not approach such a person in the way we have been describing, but there is another stratagem available to him: he treats him as prodigiously intelligent and goes to ask his advice about his personal business; he claims that although he has closer friends, still he has no choice but to impose upon him – ‘When we need words of wisdom, where are we to go? Whom can we rely on?’ Then, once he has heard what he has to say, he leaves with the declaration that he has been given no mere advice, but an inspired utterance. Or again, if he sees that the man fancies himself as a literary expert, he gives him a piece he has written, and asks him to read it and correct it. When King Mithridates was keen on medicine, some of his associates allowed him even to perform surgery on them and cauterize them: this was flattery – albeit of a physical rather than verbal kind – because the fact that they entrusted themselves to him was assumed to be evidence of his expertise. ‘The gods have many guises’, and this sort of non-apparent praise needs rather cunning safety measures: it must be exposed by deliberately drafting outlandish plans and projects and by making irrational suggestions as to how things might be improved. If he contradicts nothing, but assents to and accepts everything, and greets each proposal with a cry of ‘Well said!’ or ‘Fine!’, then he is obviously ‘pursuing a hidden agenda, while asking about the code’ – that is, he is actually wanting to praise the other person and play a part in inflating his ego.  
      <br>&emsp;Moreover – and I am reminded of the definition of painting as silent poetry – there is a kind of praise which stems from silent flattery. Just as hunters are more likely to deceive their quarry if they disguise themselves as travellers or shepherds or farmers, so flatterers get a particularly secure grip with their praise when they do not appear to be praising, but to be doing something else. Imagine, for instance, someone who gives up his chair or his seat to a later arrival, or who, while addressing the Assembly or the Council, sees that someone affluent wants to speak and so breaks off in mid-speech and hands over the rostrum and the topic to him: despite his silence, he is showing more clearly than if he shouted it out loud that he regards the other person as better than him and intellectually superior. So the reason these people can be seen occupying the front seats at lectures and plays is not that they think they deserve them, but so that they can flatter affluent people by getting up out of them; and they can be seen at gatherings and meetings starting out on a line of argument, but then giving way as if faced by people with a better case, and changing over, with no difficulty at all, to the opposite line – if the person taking the opposite line is powerful or wealthy or famous. And this shows us by far the best method of exposing this servility and submissiveness, as we must – because they do not defer to experience or excellence or age, but only to wealth and reputation. Once, when Megabyzus sat down next to Apelles the painter and tried to start a conversation about line and shading, Apelles said, ‘You see these lads here who are grinding pigment? They could hardly take their eyes off you while you were quiet, and were impressed by your purple-dyed clothes and golden jewellery; but now they are laughing at you for having embarked on a conversation about matters you don’t understand.’ And when Croesus asked what happiness is, Solon replied that Tellus (an Athenian with no public prominence) and Cleobis and Biton were more fortunate than him. Flatterers, however, make public their view that kings and rich men and political leaders are not only successful and fortunate, but are also outstandingly intelligent, skilful and so on for every virtue.  
      <br>&emsp;Some people cannot abide even hearing the Stoics claim that the wise man is ipso facto a rich, good-looking, well-born king; but flatterers explicitly say that an affluent man is ipso facto an orator and a poet, or (if the fancy takes him) a painter and a musician, or a sportsman and an athlete, by letting themselves be thrown at wrestling or fall behind at running – as Crison of Himera let himself be overtaken in a race against Alexander (but Alexander realized what he was up to and was infuriated). Carneades used to say that the sons of wealthy men and of kings learn nothing but horsemanship, and that the reason they learn nothing else properly and well is that while their teacher flatters them with compliments during their lessons and their wrestling opponent submits to them, their horse neither knows nor cares who is an ordinary citizen or who is a political leader, who is rich or who is poor, and simply bucks off all incompetent riders. It follows that Bion’s words are foolish and fatuous: ‘If eulogizing a field guaranteed its productivity and fertility, then it would not seem wrong for someone to do this rather than to dig and make trouble for himself. So it would not be odd for someone to praise a man either, if that man is useful and thoroughly productive for those who praise him.’ This is fatuous because although a field does not deteriorate by being praised, a person is made egotistical and is corrupted by false and unjustified praise.  
      <br>&emsp;Anyway, so much for these topics – the next step is to consider the issue of candour. Patroclus dressed himself up in Achilles’ armour and drove Achilles’ horses to battle, but forswore the Pelian spear, which was the only weapon he refused to handle; likewise, when a flatterer is equipped and disguised with his friend’s marks and tokens, he ought to leave behind only candour, and not handle it or imitate it, but treat it as an instrument special to friendship, ‘weighty, massive and sturdy’. But since they steer clear of the area where unalloyed laughter, jokes and levity are the means of reproof, and they elevate the business straight to a serious level and are frowning flatterers who adulterate levity with criticism and rebuke, then we must include this issue in our investigation. In my opinion, just as in Menander’s comedy Noheracles comes on with a club that has no solidity or strength, but is an empty, hollow imitation, so when we test the flatterer’s candour, we will find it feeble, flimsy, flabby and identical in effect to those pillows women use, which look as though they can stay firm and resist heads, but in fact give way and cave in. In the same way, the hollow, illusory and unreal bulk of this counterfeit candour makes it overblown and distended, so that when it is deflated the force of its collapse can capture and suck in anyone who is swept into it. Errors are the domain of the true candour of friendship, and if it is cruel, that is only because it is helpful and kind: like honey, it makes injuries sting and cleanses them, but that is its only painful aspect, and otherwise its action is benign and pleasant. We will spend some time on this type of candour later.  
      <br>&emsp;As for a flatterer, however, in the first place he lets it be known that in his dealings with other people he is a hard man, impatient and uncompromising. He is stern with his servants, fiercely cracks down on his friends’ and relatives’ mistakes, and allows no one else to impress him or win his admiration, preferring to sneer at them; he is unforgiving and rude enough to provoke anger in other people. What he wants is to be known for his hatred of anything bad, and to be recognized as someone who would not readily relinquish his candour, or do or say anything ingratiating.  
      <br>&emsp;In the second place, he pretends to be completely unaware of and unacquainted with genuine, important flaws, although he ferociously springs on trivial, irrelevant oversights: he energetically and forcefully lambasts the culprit if he sees a tool out of place, a case of poor housekeeping, or someone not bothering to have a haircut or dressing carelessly or paying inadequate attention to a dog or a horse. He is totally unconcerned, however, if someone neglects his parents, ignores his children, humiliates his wife, sneers at his relatives and ruins his assets: these situations find him tongue-tied and helpless. He is like a coach who lets an athlete get drunk and live an undisciplined life, and then makes an issue of the oil-flask and strigil; or he is like a schoolteacher who scolds his pupil for his writing tablet and writing instrument, while ignoring his flawed and faulty language. A flatterer, typically, has nothing to say about the actual speech of a ludicrously awful orator, but criticizes the sound of his voice and takes him to task for ruining his throat by drinking cold water; or if he is told to go through an atrocious script, he criticizes the roughness of the papyrus and the careless untidiness of the writer. So when Ptolemy was playing a studious role, they used to keep an argument with him going until midnight about some linguistic or prosodic or historical point, but none of them, however many there were, stood up to him in his times of sadism and arrogance, or when he was beating his hand-drums and playing the mystic. Flatterers, in short, bring candour to bear where there is no capacity for distress or pain – which is no different from using a scalpel to trim the hair and fingernails of someone with malignant growths and abscesses. 
      <br>&emsp;In the third place, we find worse insincerity in the case of those who use their candour and criticism for the other’s gratification. When Alexander rewarded some comedian very generously, Agis the Argive was prompted by his envy and hurt to cry out, ‘How incredibly odd!’ The king turned to him in anger and said, ‘What exactly do you mean?’ Agis replied, ‘I admit that I get upset and cross when I see how all you descendants of Zeus enjoy flatterers and buffoons; Heracles got pleasure from some Cercopes, Dionysus from Sileni, and it is clear that you too think highly of people of that ilk.’ And once, when Tiberius Caesar went to the Senate, one of his flatterers stood up and said, ‘It is the duty of free men to speak candidly and not to hold back or keep quiet about any worthwhile matter.’ This made everyone alert, and as soon as there was an expectant silence and he had Tiberius’ attention, he went on, ‘Listen, Caesar, to what we unanimously accuse you of, but no one dares say out loud: you neglect yourself, you expend your physical energy and exhaust yourself by worrying and working for us, day and night without stopping.’ It is said that, while he was going on and on in this vein, the orator Cassius Severus commented, ‘This candour will be the death of that man.’ 
      <br>&emsp;In fact, these are all fairly trivial aspects of flattery, but there are also aspects which are formidable and dangerous to anyone thoughtless, when flatterers accuse their victims of having afflictions and defects which are the opposite of what they are actually suffering from. The flatterer Himerius, for instance, used to stigmatize the person who was the most miserly and avaricious of the Athenian plutocrats for being extravagant and reckless and destined to reduce himself and his children to starvation. Or on the other hand flatterers might reproach extravagant spendthrifts for being mean and cheap, which is what Titus Petronius did with Nero. Or they might tell rulers who treat their subjects with savagery and brutality to refrain from acting so fairly, with such ill-timed and inexpedient leniency. A similar case is when someone treats an innocent, stupid halfwit as a terrible schemer, and pretends to be wary and afraid of him. Then there is the man who comes up to some malcontent (who delights in constantly slandering and criticizing people, but who has on this occasion been inspired to praise someone of high repute), and tells him off for his defect of praising even utterly undeserving people: ‘I mean, who is that man, after all? Has he really said or done anything outstanding?’  
      <br>&emsp;Flatterers are particularly insistent and inflammatory where their victims’ hearts are concerned. If they see people arguing with their brothers, despising their parents or having a low opinion of their wives, they do not tell them off or blame them, but they aggravate the emotion by saying, ‘You don’t think of yourself’ and ‘It’s your fault: you’re always seeing what you can do for other people and putting yourself down.’ And if anger and jealousy cause some friction between a man and his lover or mistress, then flattery – armed with its bright candour – is right by his side, making sure the fire stays blazing, justifying the friction and accusing the lover of commonly behaving in unaffectionate, hard-hearted ways which demand retribution: ‘ “You ungrateful wretch, after all the countless kisses!” ’ So it was that Antony’s friends tried to convince him that the Egyptian woman (with whom he was passionately in love) loved him too. They would insolently call him insensitive and distant, and say, ‘The woman has given up her grand kingdom and her blissful way of life: she is pining away as she accompanies you on your campaigns, playing the part of a concubine. “But you have in your heart wits proof against charm” and you ignore her pain.’ These complaints of unfair behaviour pleased him and, because he enjoyed being accused rather than praised, he was unwittingly corrupted by a semblance of reproof.  
      <br>&emsp;Candour of this sort resembles the bites of loose women, since it stimulates and arouses pleasure by pretending to cause pain. Undiluted wine, taken separately, counteracts hemlock, but if it is added to hemlock and stirred in, then it makes the effect of the drug utterly irreversible, since the heat conveys the effect to the heart; this is an analogy for how unprincipled people know that candour goes a long way towards counteracting flattery and therefore use candour itself as a form of flattery. That is why even Bias did not give a satisfactory answer when he was asked which is the most formidable creature: he replied that the tyrant is the most formidable wild creature and the flatterer the most formidable domesticated creature. But it would be more true to say that there are two categories of flatterer: the domesticated ones are those who gather around someone’s bath and table; but the flatterer who stretches his interference, slander and malevolence, like so many tentacles, into someone’s inner chambers and into the women’s quarters is wild and savage and hard to tame. 
      <br>&emsp;One protective measure, I believe, is to appreciate and constantly remember that the mind consists of one part that is trustworthy, principled and rational, but another part that is irrational, unprincipled and emotional. A friend acts as an adviser to and champion of the better part (just as a doctor develops and maintains health), but a flatterer sides with the emotional, irrational part: this is what he stimulates and titillates and tempts, and he drives a wedge between it and rationality by devising for it shoddy, sensual indulgences. Consequently, just as there are foods which cannot be assimilated by either blood or breath and fortify neither muscles nor marrow, but stimulate the genitals, excite the belly and produce flesh that is infirm and internally unsound, so a flatterer’s words – as will be obvious to any observant person – fail to fortify intelligence and the rational mind, but cultivate some erotic pleasure, or intensify thoughtless passion, or provoke spiteful envy, or expand and increase vain self-regard, or offer support to distress, or use slander and menace to sharpen malevolence, keep dependency cowed and pander to the fears of an untrusting nature. For he is forever lying in wait for some emotion which he can fatten up, and like a tumour he arrives when the mind is rotten and inflamed: ‘If you’re angry, lash out; if you want something, buy it; if you’re afraid, let’s run away; if you’re suspicious, you might well be right.’  
      <br>&emsp;The intensity and power of these emotions discompose one’s rational faculty and this makes the flatterer hard to detect; but his behaviour is similar when he concerns himself with lesser emotions too, so here he gives us a better opportunity. Suppose someone suspects himself of drinking or eating to excess, and is in two minds about bathing or dining: a friend will restrain him with the suggestion that he should take care and be circumspect, but a flatterer drags him off to the baths, or tells him to lay on some dish he is unused to and not to harm his body by fasting. And when he sees someone’s resolve weakening with regard to a journey or a voyage or some enterprise, he will say that there is no hurry, and that delay or sending someone else instead will make no difference to the outcome. And if someone has promised to lend or give some money to a relative and is regretting the promise but ashamed to break it, a flatterer tries to tip the scales towards the worse alternative, supports the person’s tightfistedness, and eliminates his remorse by telling him to be thrifty because he has many expenses and there are many people he has to satisfy. Hence, if we notice when we are coveting something, ashamed of something or afraid of something, then we will notice the flatterer at work too, because these are the feelings he is constantly championing and whose outcomes he is constantly describing with candour. Anyway, it is time to move on to another topic. 
      <br>&emsp;Let us turn now to his undertaking jobs and attending to tasks, because this is an area where a flatterer makes the difference between himself and a friend very opaque and unclear, since he seems to be ready, willing and available for anything. But a friend’s manner is ‘straightforward’ (as Euripides described ‘words of truth’) and uncomplicated and sincere, while a flatterer’s manner is actually ‘diseased within itself and requires clever medicine’ – and indeed, no ordinary medicine and in no ordinary doses. So, one can imagine an occasion of a friend meeting someone else and, without any exchange of words but solely by looks and smiles, he conveys through his eyes his inner goodwill and cordiality (which are reciprocated) and then walks on by. A flatterer, on the other hand, starts running and chasing and waving when he is still a long way off, and if he is not the first to do the spotting and the greeting, he apologizes profusely, calling frequently on men and gods to witness his innocence. Likewise where day-to-day business is concerned, friends do not bother with the trivial details: they do not complicate matters by insisting on precision, nor do they insist that they themselves must attend to everything. A flatterer, however, works in this area without stopping, pausing or resting, and allows no one else the space or room to attend to anything; he longs to be told what to do, and the lack of such instructions puts him on edge – or rather makes him utterly depressed and morose. 
      <br>&emsp;This, then, is all evidence, for intelligent people, of a kind of friendship that is false and immoral – excessively ready to play the prostitute and embrace another person. However, we must, first, be aware of how the two types differ when they promise to do something. An old author has expressed it nicely: a friend’s promise is ‘If I can do it, and if it is something that can be done’, whereas a flatterer’s is ‘You only have to tell me what you want.’ Comic playwrights also portray people like that on stage: ‘Nicomachus, set me up against the soldier and see if my whip and I don’t tenderize him all over, if I don’t make his face softer than a sponge!’  
      <br>&emsp;Second, no friend lends a hand without first lending advice and having assessed the enterprise and helped in ensuring that it is appropriate and useful. A flatterer, however – even if he is given the opportunity to join in assessing the matter and to have a say about it – wants to make himself less important than the other person and to gratify him, and furthermore does not want to give the other person the impression that he is not keen and is trying to wriggle out of working, so he puts up no resistance, but fans the other’s enthusiasm with his own. For no rich man or ruler is readily able to say, ‘ “I wish I could find a beggar, or preferably someone meaner than a beggar, who through goodwill towards me will fearlessly speak what is in his heart.” ’ Instead, like tragic playwrights, they need a chorus – a chorus of friends singing in unison – or an audience applauding as one. That is why Merope in the play suggests: ‘Make sure you have friends who aren’t obsequious in their speech, and keep beyond the locked door of the house those wicked people who pander to your pleasure.’ But they do the opposite: they anathematize people ‘who aren’t obsequious in their speech’ but who resist for their own good, and they admit ‘wicked people who pander’ – servile charmers – not only within ‘the locked door and the house’ but even within their hearts and their personal affairs.  
      <br>&emsp;Some of these flatterers – the more guileless ones – set out only to be attendants and assistants, because they do not think it right and proper to advise on such important matters; others, however – the less principled ones – stand there and mirror the other person’s puzzled frowns and head-shaking, but actually say nothing. But if the other person expresses his opinion, they say, ‘Good heavens! That’s exactly what I was going to say. You took the words out of my mouth.’ Just as mathematicians say that surfaces and lines do not in themselves bend or extend or move (since they are immaterial concepts), but can bend and extend and move along with the material bodies whose limits they form, so you will find that the parts a flatterer plays, the opinions he expresses, even his pleasures and passions, always conform to the other person; consequently, in these areas at any rate, the difference between him and a friend is easy to detect.  
      <br>&emsp;They are even easier to distinguish by the way they attend to things. A favour from a friend is like a living creature: its most important potential lies beneath the surface, and there is nothing showy or ostentatious on the outside. However, just as a doctor often cures someone without the patient knowing it, so a friend’s interventions and solutions often benefit someone who remains unaware of the friend’s attention. Arcesilaus was this kind of friend, especially when he discovered that Apelles of Chios, who was ill, was running out of money; he paid him another visit, this time with twenty drachmas, sat down beside him and said, ‘Everything in the world consists only of those Empedoclean elements – “fire, water, earth and ether, gentle and sublime” – but in your case they are awkwardly arranged.’ Meanwhile, he was rearranging the pillow, and he slipped the money underneath it without Apelles noticing. When Apelles’ old servant found the money, she wondered how it got there and told him about it, and Apelles laughed and said, ‘Arcesilaus is the perpetrator of this sleight of hand!’  
      <br>&emsp;Furthermore, ‘children take after’ those who are their parents in philosophy. At any rate, Lacydes (who was a member of Arcesilaus’ circle) was among Cephisocrates’ friends, all of whom stood by him in court when he was informed against and consequently prosecuted. When the prosecutor asked to see Cephisocrates’ ring, he quietly dropped it on the ground; Lacydes noticed this, and stepped on the ring to hide it, since the prosecution’s case depended on the ring. After the verdict, when Cephisocrates was greeting the judges, one of them, who had apparently seen what had gone on, told Cephisocrates that he should be grateful to Lacydes and explained what had happened, although Lacydes had told no one. Likewise, I think, most of the blessings the gods confer are unnoticed by the recipients, since for the gods benevolence and charity are innately pleasant.  
      <br>&emsp;On the other hand, a flatterer’s activity is never honest, genuine, straightforward or generous; instead, it generates sweat, noise and frenetic scampering about, and a face that is tense with the superficial appearance of laborious and earnest service. (He reminds one of an elaborate painting which evokes an impression of clarity by means of lurid colours and angled folds, wrinkles and corners.) And then he recounts all the trips the business has caused him to make, how worried he has been, and how he has put others’ backs up, and lists the innumerable efforts he has made and the ordeals he has endured, and ends up declaring that it was not worth it. In all this he is obnoxious, because any favour which is turned to criticism is obnoxious, repellent and intolerable, and a flatterer’s favours contain an element of criticism and of wanting the other person to feel ashamed even while they are being performed, not with hindsight. However, if a friend is required to talk about the matter, he gives a restrained report, and says nothing about himself. This was the way in which the Spartans sent grain to the inhabitants of Smyrna when they needed it: when the Smyrnaeans expressed astonishment at their charity, the Spartans replied, ‘It was nothing momentous: we voted to deprive ourselves and our draught-animals of the midday meal for one day, and it added up to what we sent you.’ This kind of charity is not only generous, but also more gratifying to the recipients, because they think that their benefactors are not being hurt to any great extent. 
      <br>&emsp;Anyway, the flatterer’s nature is most recognizable not in the obnoxiousness with which he attends to matters, nor in the ease with which he makes promises, but rather in whether he undertakes jobs for good or despicable purposes and contributes towards someone’s benefit or his gratification. For a friend will not think (as Gorgias used to put it) that his friend ought to work for him in moral ways and then himself go on to serve his friend in all sorts of immoral ways: ‘He was born for mutual virtue, not mutual imperfection.’ In other words, he is more likely to try to dissuade his friend from unsuitable action, and if he fails, there is Phocion’s fine comment to Antipater: ‘You cannot treat me as both a friend and a flatterer’ – that is, as a friend and not as a friend. For a friend is there as a colleague not a co-rogue, to consult with not to conspire with, for support in spreading facts not fictions – and yes, even to share his adversity not his perversity. If it is not even desirable to know about friends’ despicable actions, how could it be desirable to take part in them and share the disgrace? In other words, a friend behaves like the Spartans: when they had been defeated by Antipater and were negotiating terms with him, they had no objection to his imposing any penalty he liked upon them, provided that it did not disgrace them; and a friend has no objection to being the first to be called upon and thinks he ought to be involved and makes no excuses and is enthusiastic when a job crops up which entails expense or danger or hard work, but when the job entails disgrace, all he asks is to have nothing to do with it and not to be involved. But flattery, on the contrary, backs away from tasks which entail hard work or danger, and if you tap flattery to test its quality, it sounds flawed – a result of making excuses – and cheap. But if you abuse a flatterer and trample on him, having set him to despicable, demeaning, disreputable menial tasks, he does not think it at all awful or insulting.  
      <br>&emsp;Consider a monkey. Because it cannot guard property like a dog, or endure weight like a horse, or plough land like cattle, abuse and sarcasm and jokes are heaped upon it, as a self-created catalyst of laughter. In much the same way, a flatterer is incapable of backing anyone up verbally, or contributing money, or siding with anyone, and stops short whenever hard work and effort are called for; but he is wholehearted – in underhand actions; he can be relied on – to facilitate a love affair; he is precise – when it comes to paying a whore; he takes care – when elucidating his calculation of the cost of a drink; he is no sluggard – when meals need preparing; he is attentive – to people’s mistresses; he is strong-willed and unshakeable – when told to taunt the in-laws or help in expelling a wife. Consequently, here too the man’s behaviour gives him away, since he is ready to give freely of himself when told to attend to any disreputable, despicable matter you may care to mention, so as to gratify the person who is giving him the order.  
      <br>&emsp;One of the chief areas in which a considerable difference between a flatterer and a friend becomes obvious is in their attitude towards other friends. It is a source of great pleasure for a friend to be far from alone in liking and being liked, and what he constantly spends his time trying to achieve for a friend is a wide circle of friends and considerable public recognition, because he thinks that friends share things and therefore ought above all to share friends. A flatterer, however, is false, phony and debased, because he is well aware that he is mistreating friendship by using it as a counterfeit coin. He is naturally envious, but it is people similar to himself that he relates to in an envious fashion, by striving to beat them in a contest of jokes and gossip; on the other hand, he stands in fear and trembling of anyone better than himself, but certainly not because ‘he is a foot-soldier marching beside a Lydian chariot’, but because (in Simonides’ words) ‘he does not even have unalloyed lead to compare with purified gold’. So since he is a shallow, superficial impostor, then when he is compared and investigated in close proximity to genuine, substantial, solid-wrought friendship, he patently does not make the grade, and so he behaves just like the man who painted an abominable picture of some cocks and told his slave to shoo all the real cocks as far away as possible from the painting: the flatterer shoos real friends away and refuses to let them get close. If he cannot do that, then in public he cringes, and is at their beck and call, and stands in awe of them, because they are better people than him; but in private he spreads and scatters lies about them.  
      <br>&emsp;And once the chafing of covert talk has produced a festering wound (even if it takes time to produce such an extreme result), he bears in mind and cherishes Medius’ role. Medius was, so to speak, the ringleader and chief mentor of the chorus of flatterers who surrounded Alexander and who ganged up against those of good character. He told his troupe to go all out for afflicting and hurting their victim with their lies, on the grounds that even if he healed the wound, the lies would still have caused a lingering scab. And it was indeed these scabs – or rather gangrene and cancers – that consumed Alexander and caused him to execute Callisthenes, Parmenion and Philotas; he then entrusted himself wholeheartedly to people like Hagno, Bagoas, Agis and Demetrius, who contrived his downfall by prostrating themselves before him, dressing him up and presenting him as if he were some Eastern idol. Pandering to pleasure has that much power, and nowhere does it have more, apparently, than on people with the greatest public images, because the belief that one has the best qualities, coupled with aspirations towards them, gives a flatterer confidence and encourages him as well. Although high ground is hard for those with designs upon it to approach and reach, nevertheless elevated opinions in a mind which, thanks to external or innate factors, lacks common sense are particularly accessible to pettiness and meanness.  
      <br>&emsp;This is why I now repeat the advice I gave at the beginning of this discourse – that we should eliminate self-love and self-importance from ourselves, because it prepares the ground for external flatterers by flattering us first and softening us up for them. However, if we trust the god and appreciate how extremely precious for each of us is the precept ‘Know yourself’, and if we also survey our character, upbringing and conditioning to see how in countless respects they fall short of goodness and include bad, unchosen behaviour, speech and moods, then we will make it hard for flatterers to trample on us. Alexander said that his sleeping and having sex were the prime reasons for his disbelieving those who called him a god, since in these respects he was more dependent and passive than he should be; and if we observe how often and in how many respects our own attributes are disgraceful, distressing, imperfect and wrong, we will constantly discover that we do not need a friend to commend and compliment us, but to take us to task and speak candidly – yes, and even critically too – about our misdeeds.  
      <br>&emsp;This need arises because there are few who have the courage to speak candidly rather than gratifyingly to friends, and again, even among the few, it is far from easy to find people who really know how to do this, rather than those who think they are using candour when they are merely being rude and critical. In fact, however, candour is no different from any other medicine: if it is not administered at the right time, the result is distress and disturbance with no benefit, and its effects are in a sense only a painful version of the pleasant effects of flattery. Inopportune criticism is just as harmful as inopportune praise, and is a prime factor in making people susceptible, easy targets for flattery, when they flow like water off the forbidding slopes and towards the undemanding valleys. This is why candour must be tempered by tact and must be rational, so that it is not overdone and so that its impact is diluted, as if it were bright light: otherwise, because people are upset and hurt by those who criticize everything and disparage everyone, they turn for shelter to the shadow of the flatterer and incline towards freedom from distress.  
      <br>&emsp;You see, Philopappus, the means of sheltering from every kind of vice is virtue, and not the opposite vice: some people imagine they can use coarseness to escape timidity or slickness to escape rusticity, and can position their attitudes as far away as possible from cowardice and effeminacy if they appear to be as close as possible to impudence and audacity. Others make atheism their defence against superstition and unscrupulousness their defence against silliness, and so their inexperience of anything straight and upright distorts their character, as if it were a piece of wood, so that instead of being warped one way it is warped the opposite way. And the most despicable way that flatterers dissemble is by causing distress with no accompanying benefit; and to use unpleasantness and severity to avoid losing face and demeaning oneself in friendship is a sure sign of clumsiness and incompetence as regards affectionate relationships, and resembles an emancipated slave in a comedy, who thinks he should make use of his right to address others on equal terms by addressing them in defamatory terms.  
      <br>&emsp;So since both involving oneself in flattery (by trying to gratify someone) and avoiding flattery (but in the process destroying friendship and affection by excessive candour) are despicable; and since we must allow neither of these to happen, and candour is no exception to the general principle that the mean is where virtue is found; then this topic – in so far as it requires developing – turns out to provide our essay with a natural conclusion.  
      <br>&emsp;Candour, therefore, is plainly beset by rather a lot of fatal defects, and the first one to remove from it is self-love: we must make absolutely sure that no one could think that we were merely being rude because of some personal reason such as unfair or hurtful treatment. For any words spoken for personal reasons are assumed to be provoked not by goodwill but by anger, and to constitute disparagement rather than rebuke – the difference being that candour is altruistic and high-minded, while disparagement is self-centred and petty, which is why candour earns respect and admiration, while disparagement earns recrimination and contempt. For instance, Agamemnon refused to put up with Achilles’ apparently moderate candour, but when Odysseus lays into him savagely with the words ‘You loser! How I wish you were in command of another pitiful army!’, he gives in and lets him get away with it, because he is humbled by the goodwill and sense of what he says. For Odysseus had no grounds for a personal grudge and spoke his mind for the good of Greece, whereas Achilles gave the impression of having personal reasons for getting so angry. Still, Achilles himself, despite his ‘lack of sweet or indulgent disposition’, and although he was ‘a dreadful man, liable to accuse even the innocent’, often quietly let Patroclus inveigh against him with remarks such as: ‘You pitiless man! The horseman Peleus was not your father, nor was Thetis your mother: the grey sea and the sheer cliffs gave you birth, as is proved by your merciless mind.’  
      <br>&emsp;The orator Hyperides used to recommend that the Athenians consider not just whether he was being harsh, but whether or not he had reason to be harsh; and likewise, because a friend’s rebukes are free of any personal feelings, they command respect and are valued and cogent. If it is clear that your candour in speaking to a friend owes absolutely nothing to the fact that he has wronged you, and that this plays no part at all, but you are taking him to task for other misdeeds of his and not stopping yourself from making him feel remorse for what he has done to others, then the energy of this candour is overwhelming, and because you, as rebuker, are being so agreeable, you intensify the harshness and severity of the rebuke. So, although it is right that it is particularly important to do or plan something useful and appropriate [ for friends when we are angry or arguing with them, yet it is just as relevant to friendship, on occasions when we ourselves are being overlooked and ignored, to speak candidly on behalf of others who are also being ignored, and to remind our friends of them. 
      <br>&emsp;So there was a time when Plato and Dionysius were looking askance at each other and getting into arguments. Plato asked Dionysius for an appointment, which Dionysius granted, but he was thinking that Plato wanted to go through a catalogue of self-centred complaints. Plato, however, started a conversation with him, as follows: ‘Dionysius, if you heard that someone had sailed to Sicily with a grudge, and was wanting to do you harm, but hadn’t found the opportunity, would you let him sail away? Would you give him the chance to get away scot-free?’ ‘Not at all, Plato,’ replied Dionysius. ‘It is important to disapprove of and punish not only one’s enemies’ actions, but also their intentions.’ ‘So,’ Plato went on, ‘if someone has come here with warmth in his heart for you and wanted to do you good in some way, by his own agency, but you hadn’t given him the opportunity, does he deserve to be let go without thanks or due regard?’ When Dionysius asked whom he meant, Plato said, ‘Aeschines – in character as equable a man as any of Socrates’ circle, and as capable of improving his acquaintances by his conversation; but although he sailed a considerable distance to get here, so as to make your acquaintance on the basis of philosophy, he has been ignored.’ Dionysius was so stirred by this, and so impressed by Plato’s benevolence and magnanimity, that he immediately embraced Plato and hugged him, and also gave Aeschines the proper consideration suited to his stature.  
      <br>&emsp;The second defect to remove from candour – in order to purify it, as it were – is any trace of insolence and mockery and ridicule and sarcasm, which spice up candour in a contemptible way. For just as when a doctor performs an operation, it is important that a certain delicacy and precision inform his actions, and that his hand is free of the superfluous suppleness suitable for a dancer or for wild and random gestures, so candour admits cleverness and wit (as long as this charm preserves the dignity of the candour), but perishes and is utterly destroyed at the approach of belligerence, sarcasm and insolence. So the lyre-player found a convincing and elegant way to shut Philip up when he was trying to argue with him about how to pluck the strings; he said, ‘I hope, my lord, that you never suffer such misfortune that you become more expert than me on these matters.’ Epicharmus, on the other hand, was wrong in his remark to Hieron: Hieron once had some of his associates killed, and a few days later invited Epicharmus to dinner; Epicharmus said, ‘You didn’t invite your friends when you were performing a sacrifice the other day.’ And Antiphon was wrong too, in replying to the question what the best kind of bronze is – when this inquiry occurred in Dionysius’ presence – ‘The bronze from which the statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton were made at Athens.’ These remarks cause distress and pain with no benefit, and their sarcasm and levity cause no pleasure either; all behaviour of this kind originates in lack of self-control when it is fostered by hostility and blended with bad manners and insolence, and those who make use of such behaviour also ruin themselves, dancing as they are on the brink of a chasm. In fact, Antiphon was executed by Dionysius and Timagenes fell from Caesar’s favour – Timagenes, who never uttered a non-derivative phrase, but at any party or during any discussion kept on using friendship as specious justification for abuse, for no serious purpose at all, ‘but because it drew more laughter from the Argives’.  
      <br>&emsp;Now, the comic poets often composed harsh, socially pertinent messages to address to the audience; but because they mixed sarcasm and humour together, like an obnoxious mixed sauce for food, they wasted their candour and destroyed its potential benefit, and consequently the poets were left only with a reputation for spite and rudeness, and the audience was left with no profit at all from the poets’ words. Jocularity and humour are all right to use among friends on the odd occasion, but candour must preserve its seriousness and its own character; and if it is focusing on rather important matters, then your words must be made convincing and stirring by your use of emotion, gesture and tone.  
      <br>&emsp;Bad timing is always extremely harmful, and never more so than when it destroys the point of candour. It is patently obvious that we must take care in this regard if we are ever drinking and getting tipsy. A person makes blue skies overcast if he interrupts light-hearted fun by starting up a discussion that furrows brows and tautens faces as if it were hostile to the god of freedom, who, in Pindar’s words, ‘frees the fetters of anxious cares’. Bad timing is also extremely dangerous, because wine makes minds teeter on the brink of anger, and inebriation often annexes candour and converts it into hostility. And in general it is not a sign of calibre or courage, but of cowardice, to speak one’s mind only at the table and never when sober: this is how craven dogs behave. Anyway, there is no need to carry on with this topic.  
      <br>&emsp;Many people do not think it right – or do not have the courage – to try to control friends whose affairs are going well: they regard success as completely beyond the reach of rebuke. However, when a friend stumbles and trips, they oppress and ride roughshod over him, now that he has been humbled and brought low: they release their candour upon him all in a rush, like a stream which had been unnaturally dammed, and because of his former superciliousness and their former weakness, they relish the opportunity to take advantage of his change of fortune. It follows that it is rather important to discuss this matter too, and to find a reply to Euripides when he says, ‘When God grants success, what need is there of friends?’ 
      <br>&emsp;The answer is that successful people have a particular need of friends who speak their minds and deflate any excessive pride, since success and sound judgement rarely go together: in the majority of cases, while luck is inflating and destabilizing people, sense needs to be imported and rationality to be forced on them from outside. On the other hand, when God lays them low and divests them of their pretensions, events themselves contain an inherent rebuke and a stimulus to remorse; so there is at that time nothing for friendly candour or serious, caustic words to do, but on occasions of change of fortune of that order, it is really ‘pleasing to look into the eyes of a kindly man’, if he is being supportive and encouraging. Clearchus was a case in point: according to Xenophon, the sight of his kind and considerate face during battles or when danger was imminent used to put heart into his threatened men.  
      <br>&emsp;However, the employment of candid and caustic speech on someone out of luck is like applying a stimulant to an afflicted and inflamed eye: it does not cure anything or alleviate the pain, but adds to the pain the extra element of anger and makes the sufferer worse off. At any rate, there is no way that a healthy person gets cross or fierce with a friend for criticizing the company he keeps and his drinking, or his laziness, unfitness, constant bathing and excessive eating at the wrong times of day; but it is not just intolerable for someone who is ill, but even increases his illness, to be told that his present condition is due to his indulgence, effeminate lifestyle, rich food and womanizing. ‘You certainly know how to pick a bad moment,’ he responds. ‘Here am I, writing my will and having castor or scammony, perhaps, prepared for me by my doctors; and you start telling me off and getting all philosophical!’ So this is an example of how the actual circumstances of people who are out of luck make candour and stating the obvious unacceptable: what is required is a considerate and helping hand. When children fall over, their nannies do not run up to give them the rough edge of their tongues, but they pick them up, wash them clean and calm them down, and only then do they tick them off and scold them.  
      <br>&emsp;There is a story that when Demetrius of Phalerum had been exiled from his homeland and was spending time near Thebes, with no public prominence and occupying himself with lowly affairs, he once saw Crates approaching and was not pleased, because he expected to be on the receiving end of some typically Cynic candour and rough words. Crates, however, greeted him civilly and struck up a conversation about how exile was not inherently bad or worth getting upset about, since one is released from risky, insecure circumstances: he was encouraging him not to be depressed about himself and his situation. Demetrius’ spirits rose and he cheered up; he told his friends that he regretted those affairs and occupations of his which had prevented his getting to know a man like Crates.  
      <br>&emsp;‘From friends comes kindly conversation when one is distressed, and rebuke when one is excessively foolish.’ That is how exemplary friends behave, but inferior, worthless flatterers of successful people are, as Demosthenes puts it, ‘like fractures and sprains: they are aroused whenever the body later suffers any ill’. So flatterers latch on to changes in fortune as though they enjoyed them and found them a source of fulfilment. If the past needs to be brought up at all when a bad plan has laid someone low and it was his own fault, then these words are enough: ‘This was not in accordance with our will – in fact, for my part, I often spoke strongly against it.’  
      <br>&emsp;Under what circumstances, then, ought a friend to be forceful? When should he use the power that candour carries? Whenever he is presented with the opportunity to stem the tide of hedonism or anger or arrogance, or to curtail venality or restrain stupid thoughtlessness. An example is Solon’s candour when he told Croesus, who had been corrupted and spoiled by transient success, to look to the end. This is also how Socrates used to restrain Alcibiades, and he elicited tears of genuine remorse by showing him the error of his ways and made him turn over a new leaf. Cyrus’ treatment of Cyaxares was similiar, and so was Plato’s of Dion: when Dion’s glory was at its most resplendent, and the sublimity and grandeur of his actions were attracting the attention of the whole world towards himself, Plato recommended that he should be wary and fearful of ‘wilfulness, because isolation lodges with it’. Speusippus too wrote in a letter to Dion that he should not be proud at being a frequent topic of conversation among children and women, but should make sure that he embellished Sicily with religiousness, morality and the best laws, and so ‘won renown’ for the Academy. On the other hand, as long as Perseus was successful, his courtiers Euctus and Eulaeus constantly conducted themselves with a view to his gratification: they were yes-men and followed his lead like everyone else. But after his catastrophic encounter with the Romans at Pydna and his subsequent flight, they used to afflict him with their harsh criticisms and remind him of his mistakes and oversights, casting each and every one of them in his teeth, until, tormented by pain and fury, the man struck them both with his short-sword and did away with them. 
      <br>&emsp;So we have by now discussed the parameters of opportunities for candour which occur thanks to both parties at once; but opportunities are commonly created by one party in particular, and a caring friend should not let them pass, but should exploit them. For there are occasions when a question, a description, and a criticism or commendation of similar traits in others prepare the ground, so to speak, for candour. For instance, there is a story that Demaratus went to Macedonia at a time when Philip was quarrelling with his wife and son; when Philip greeted him and asked about the state of inter-Greek entente cordiale, Demaratus (who was concerned for Philip and knew him well) replied, ‘It is really very good of you to ask about the rapport between Athens and Sparta, and to disregard the fact that your own household is overrun with so much conflict and disharmony.’ Diogenes did well too: he once arrived at Philip’s camp – Philip was marching to fight the Greeks – and was taken to him; Philip did not know who he was and asked if he was a spy. ‘I most certainly am a spy, Philip,’ he said. ‘I spy on your absence of wisdom and common sense, which is the only thing forcing you to go and gamble your kingdom and your life in a single moment.’  
      <br>&emsp;It may be that this was over-forceful. Opportunities for rebuke also arise, however, when people have been berated for their mistakes and are feeling humble and deflated. A subtle person comes up with an elegant use of this situation: he deflects the people who were berating his friend, sends them packing, and once he has got his friend to himself, he reminds him that he ought to be careful, even if the only reason for doing so is to put an end to his enemies’ presumption: ‘I mean, what occasion can there be for them to utter a word, what can they say against you, if you banish and rid yourself of the things which give rise to the slanders against you?’ In this way, anything hurtful is credited to a berater, and anything beneficial to a rebuker.  
      <br>&emsp;An even more clever tactic is used by some people: by criticizing others, they make their acquaintances repent, because the faults they find in the others are those which they know their friends commit. My teacher Ammonius once found out during an afternoon lecture that some of his pupils had eaten a variety of dishes at midday: he told his freedman to whip his (Ammonius’) slave, and adduced as a reason his inability to eat without also drinking. And he simultaneously looked at us, so that the reprimand went home to those who deserved it.  
      <br>&emsp;The next point to note is that care must be taken about using candour towards a friend when there are a lot of people around – one should bear in mind what happened to Plato. Once Socrates laid into one of his associates rather forcefully while talking near the banking stalls. Plato said, ‘Wouldn’t it have been better to have said that in private?’ Socrates replied, ‘Wouldn’t it have been better for you to have spoken to me like that in private?’ And there is a story that Pythagoras once attacked a pupil rather harshly when there were a lot of people around and the young man hanged himself; from then on, Pythagoras never again told anyone off in the presence of anyone else.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that deviance should be regarded as a disfiguring disease, and should be chastised and exposed only in secret, not as if it were a public festival or display, or in such a way as to attract witnesses and an audience. It is not a friend, but a sophist, who enhances his own reputation by others’ failures and preens himself in front of the audience: this is the behaviour of those doctors who perform operations in theatres so as to make money. Leaving aside the arrogance (which is never justified in any form of treatment), one must also consider the contentiousness and wilfulness that accompany character flaws. It is not just that (as Euripides puts it) ‘the more love is disapproved of, the more it stimulates’, but that public and plentiful disapproval makes anyone, whatever his defect or condition, disregard decency. Therefore, just as Plato thinks it a prerequisite for elderly people who are trying to inculcate decency in the younger generation to behave decently themselves towards the young people, so the sensitive candour of friends is the best instigator of sensitivity, and a careful, calm approach and assault on a deviator undermines and eradicates his flaw, which becomes infected by respect for the respect shown it. That is why it is best to ‘put your head close, so that the others might not hear’. And the most disgraceful behaviour of all is to expose a husband within his wife’s hearing, a father when his children can see, someone in love when the object of his affection is present or a teacher in the presence of his pupils, because pain and fury make them completely forget themselves when they are censured in front of those whose good opinion they expect.  
      <br>&emsp;In my opinion, in Clitus’ case too, it was not so much the wine that made him irritating as that he appeared to be telling Alexander off when there were a lot of people present. And because Ptolemy’s teacher Aristomenes once woke him up with a slap when he was nodding off in front of a delegation, he let in Ptolemy’s flatterers, who pretended to take Ptolemy’s side and to be cross, and said, ‘If you fell asleep after all your hard work and sleepless nights, we ought to reprimand you in private, not lay hands on you in front of so many people.’ Ptolemy sent a cup of poison to the man and told him to drink it. Moreover, Aristophanes says that Cleon found fault with him, and tried to incite the Athenians against him, for ‘slandering the state in the presence of foreigners’.  
      <br>&emsp;It follows that this is another thing to watch out for, along with the others we have discussed, if one wants to avoid exhibitionism and currying favour with people, and concentrate on using candour as a means of beneficial treatment. In fact, it ought to be possible for people who use candour to say what Thucydides had the Corinthians say about themselves: ‘We are in a position to criticize others.’ That is quite right: as Lysander apparently said to the Megarian who, at a meeting of the allies, was speaking candidly on behalf of Greece, ‘Your words need a city to back them’, so any person’s candour presumably needs moral authority – a saying that is nowhere more true than in the case of those who rebuke others and try to instil self-responsibility in them. At any rate, Plato used to say that his way of life was his means of reprimanding Speusippus; and likewise, of course, Xenocrates needed only to be seen by Polemon during a lecture, and to glance at him, to convert him and change his life. On the other hand, if anyone whose character lacks authority and goodness employs candour in his speech, the inevitable response is ‘a healer of others with sores erupting all over his own body’.  
      <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, there are many situations which induce people, even though they themselves are less than perfect, to rebuke others similar to themselves with whom they are associating: here the most reasonable tactic would be one in which the person speaking his mind is somehow simultaneously implicated and embraced in the accusation. This is the context of the line ‘Son of Tydeus, what has happened to us? Why have we forgot- ten our fierce heroism?’, and also of the line ‘At the moment, all of us together are no match for Hector by himself.’ An example of a similar principle is how when Socrates used to refute his young associates, he never supposed that he was immune from ignorance himself, but thought that he ought to accompany them in concentrating on virtue and searching for truth. The point is that warmth and trust are inspired by people who seem to have the same flaws and seem to be correcting themselves along with their friends, whereas anyone who, while castigating someone else, adopts an elevated position, as if he were some pure and dispassionate entity, comes across – unless he is considerably advanced in years or has acknowledged standing because of his virtue and reputation – as offensive and oppressive and consequently is no help at all. That is why Phoenix disingenuously included the disasters that had happened in his own case, when anger impelled him to try to kill his father and he quickly relented ‘in case the Greeks dubbed me parricide’, because he did not want to give the impression, while reprimanding Achilles, of being himself beyond the reach of anger and altogether faultless. For that is the way to get through to and affect someone’s character, and people are less likely to resist someone who seems to have the same feelings and does not give the impression of despising them.  
      <br>&emsp;A bright light should not be brought close to an inflamed eye, and neither can a mind which has been taken over by the emotions submit to candour and undiluted reproof. Therefore, one of the most useful ways to be of assistance is to blend in a pinch of praise, as in the following lines: ‘You are the best men in the army, so you can no longer do well by refraining from fierce heroism. For my part, I have no argument with anyone who refrains from fighting – provided he is a weakling; but in my heart I am furious with you.’ There are also the lines: ‘Pandarus, where is your bow? Where are your winged arrows? Where is your fame, which no man here can contest?’‘ There are also lines like the following, which issue a clarion call of encouragement to people under pressure: ‘What has happened to Oedipus and his famous riddles? ‘ and ‘Are these the words of Heracles, who has often proven dauntless?  
      <br>&emsp;Speaking like that not only softens the harshness and bossiness of the criticism, but also sets up an internal rivalry: he is made to feel shame for his disgraceful aspects by being reminded of his fine aspects and by making himself an example of better conduct. However, comparisons with others (of the same age, for example, or country or family) aggravate and exacerbate the contentiousness which accompanies any flaw, and which invariably retorts angrily: ‘So why don’t you shove off to my betters, and leave me in peace?’ When employing candour, therefore, one must be careful about praising others – unless, of course, those others are the person’s parents. That is why Agamemnon says, ‘Tydeus certainly fathered a son who scarcely resembles him’, and in The Scyrians Odysseus says, ‘Here you are, bringing the bright light of your family into disgrace by knitting, when your father is the greatest man in Greece.’  
      <br>&emsp;The most unsuitable behaviour of all is to repay a rebuke with a rebuke and candour with candour, because it makes tempers rapidly flare and provokes argumentativeness, and in general this kind of bickering can give the impression of stemming not from an attempt to retort with candour but from an inability to abide candour. It is preferable, therefore, to let a friend get away with it, when he seems to be telling you off, because if at a later date he goes wrong himself and needs telling off, then the situation itself in a sense allows candour to be candid: if, without bearing a grudge, you remind him that he himself has tended not to stand idly by when his friends go wrong, but rather to censure them and take them in hand, he is more likely to submit and be open to correction, and will see it as repayment stemming not from angry recrimination, but from charitable goodwill.  
      <br>&emsp;There is also the point that Thucydides makes when he says, ‘Anyone who, in pursuing the highest goals, tolerates envy has the right priorities.’ It is correct for a friend to put up with the hostility his reprimands generate, when crucially important issues are involved. However, if he gets irate at everything, whatever the situation, and relates to his acquaintances as if they were his pupils rather than his friends, then when very important issues arise and he tries to deliver a reprimand, he will be feeble and ineffective – he has used up his candour, like a doctor who dispenses in many minor and unessential cases medicine which, though harsh and bitter, is essential and valuable. So he will, first, be very careful about being constantly critical himself; second, where other people are concerned, if someone else fusses and nags about everything, he will use this as a stepping-stone, so to speak, to approach the other person’s more important flaws. When the doctor Philotimus was shown a sore finger by a man with an abscess on his liver, he said, ‘My friend, the issue in your case is not a whitlow’; so too, given the opportunity, a friend can say to someone who carps at trivial, worthless things, ‘Why are we making an issue of merry-making, carousing and incidentals? My friend, if he would only get rid of his lover, or stop gambling, we would find him exceptional in all other respects.’ The point is that leniency over minor matters makes a friend’s candour about more important matters not unwelcome, whereas constant harassment, continual severity and ill-humour, and making it one’s business to know everything and to interfere in everything, are not only more than flesh and blood can stand, but are intolerable even to slaves.  
      <br>&emsp;As Euripides says, not every aspect of old age is bad; and the same goes for one’s friends’ fallibility. Therefore we must observe our friends when they do right as well as when they do wrong; and our starting-point should certainly be to be ready to praise them. Cooling contracts iron and hardens it into steel, provided it has first been made tractable and fluid by heat; similarly, friends who have been relaxed and warmed by praise must later be calmly treated to a cooling bath, so to speak, of candour. Given the opportunity, we must say, ‘Do you think there is any comparison between these two types of behaviour? Can you see what kind of harvest goodness yields? We who are your friends demand that behaviour from you: it is proper to you, it is your birthright. But you must banish the other kind “into the mountains or into the waves of the roaring sea”.’  
      <br>&emsp;A considerate doctor would rather use sleep and diet than castor and scammony to relieve a patient of illness, and by the same token a good friend, a conscientious father and a teacher enjoy using praise rather than criticism as a means of moral improvement. The one thing above all which makes candour hurt as little as possible, and be as remedial as possible, is to deal in a tactful and kindly fashion, without any trace of rancour, with people who are making mistakes. That is why it is important not to criticize them harshly if they deny their faults, or to stop them defending themselves: one should even help them in some way to come up with plausible excuses and should make room for a more moderate reason by distancing oneself from the worse one. This is what Hector did when he said to his brother, ‘What are you up to? It is wrong of you to have stored up this anger in your heart’ – as if his withdrawal from the battle was not a cowardly bolt, but was prompted by anger. In the same vein, Nestor said to Agamemnon, ‘You succumbed to your proud hearted temper.’  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that it is more likely to have an effect on someone’s character to say ‘It didn’t occur to you’ and ‘You didn’t know’ rather than ‘That was a criminal act’ and ‘You acted disgracefully’; ‘You shouldn’t emulate your brother’ rather than ‘You shouldn’t be jealous of your brother’; and ‘You should avoid the corrupting influence of that woman’ rather than ‘You should stop corrupting that woman.’ But although this is the path candour looks for when it is trying to remedy a defect, nevertheless when its goal is preventive, it takes the contrary route. When what is necessary is to divert people who are poised to go wrong, or when we want to energize and motivate people who are being won over when faced with some powerful impulse which is tending in a direction opposite to what is required, or who are being weak and disconsolate with regard to correct conduct, then we must attribute the situation to motives which are out of character and discreditable. Thus, when Odysseus is inciting Achilles in Sophocles’ play, he says that it is not the case that the meal has made him angry, but ‘As soon as you caught sight of the buildings of Troy, you were afraid’; and again, when Achilles is livid at this and announces his intention to sail away, Odysseus says, ‘I know what you’re running away from, and it’s not slander: Hector is close – you’re right not to stay.’ In other words, threatening to let it be known that a courageous hero is a coward, or that a restrained and disciplined man is a libertine, or that a generous and munificent person is petty and avaricious, inspires them towards correct conduct and deters them from contemptible conduct, provided that one is demonstrably moderate in irremediable circumstances and distressed and sympathetic, rather than critical, when speaking candidly, but forceful, implacable and unwavering when trying to prevent errors and when resisting emotions, since this is the right time for unquenchable goodwill and true candour.  
      <br>&emsp;It is noticeable that enemies too use criticism of past behaviour against one another – and so Diogenes used to say that for safety’s sake no one ought to have either good friends (to take one in hand) or fervent enemies (to tell one off). However, heeding advice and consequently taking care not to make mistakes are preferable to being berated and consequently regretting one’s mistakes. That is why one should apply oneself to candour with the dedication due to a craft, to the extent that it is the most important and effective medicine available to friendship; but it constantly requires accuracy of timing, above all, and also dilution to prevent it being too strong.  
      <br>&emsp;So since, as we have said before, candour inevitably often hurts the person undergoing the treatment, medical practice provides an important model: when doctors perform an operation, they do not abandon the part that has been operated on and leave it aching and sore, but they apply soothing lotions and poultices; and tactful critics do not run away either, after they have employed their harsh and painful treatment, but they use conversation of a different kind, consisting of tempered words, to allay and disperse the hurt, as sculptors smooth and polish the parts of their statues where tools have been used and bits of stone broken off. If someone has been marked by having the tool of candour used on him, and is left with rough edges, bumps and uneven surfaces, he will be angry and therefore unresponsive and recalcitrant at a later date. It follows that this is another thing – one of the most important – for critics to watch out for: they should not leave too soon, or make anything hurtful and provocative the conclusion of their association and relationship with their acquaintances.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="OnAnger">
      SULLA:  
      <br>&emsp;Fundanus,I think the painters’ practice of periodically examining their paintings before adding the finishing touches is commendable. Continuous familiarity hides the ways in which something might vary slightly from what is required; so by interrupting their viewing, they use repeated discrimination to keep the viewing fresh and more likely to catch minor variations. But it is impossible for a person to apply himself to himself only periodically, by separating himself and interrupting the continuity of his self-awareness – and this is the main reason why everyone is a poorer judge of himself than of others. Therefore, a second-best course is for him periodically to inspect his friends and to make himself available to them for the same purpose, which is not to see if he has suddenly grown old or if his body is in a better or worse condition, but for them to examine his habits and character, to see if over a period of time any good features have been added or bad ones subtracted.  
      <br>&emsp;Anyway, I’ve come back to Rome after over a year away, and I’ve been with you for over four months now. I don’t find it particularly surprising that the good points you were already innately endowed with have developed and increased so much; but when I see how much more amenable and submissive to reason that strong, fiery temper of yours has become, I am inclined to comment on your impetuosity by quoting the line, ‘It is amazing how much more gentle he is.’  
      <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, this gentleness has not made you ineffective or languid, but it has replaced your notorious sudden changes of mood with a smooth surface and an effective, productive depth – like a cultivated field. It is also clear, therefore, that your temper is not waning because advancing age has made it start to decline, or because of any other automatic factor, but because it is being treated by good rational advice. But I must confess that when our mutual friend Eros told me this about you, I suspected that his warmth towards you was making him attribute to you qualities which truly good people ought to have, even though you didn’t have them – and I thought this despite the fact that, as you know, he is the last person to renounce an opinion just in order to please anyone. But I now see that he is not guilty of perjury. Since we have nothing else to do while we’re travelling, I wonder if you would explain how you made your temper so tame, moderate, and amenable and obedient to reason – what regimen you followed, so to speak.  
      
      <br>FUNDANUS:  
      <br>&emsp;You’re too kind, Sulla. Are you sure that your warm friendship towards me is not blinding you to some aspects of my character? I mean, even Eros himself often fails to restrain his temper and ‘keep it steadily compliant’ (as Homer puts it); it is righteous indignation that makes it boil over. So it is possible that I seem amenable compared to him on these occasions, just as high notes can take the place of low notes, relative to other high notes, when one scale changes into another.  
      <br>SULLA:  
      <br>&emsp;Neither of these are realistic possibilities, Fundanus. Please, as a favour to me, do what I asked.  
      <br>FUNDANUS:  
      <br>&emsp;All right. Musonius came up with some excellent suggestions, Sulla, and one of them, as I recall, was that a life of constant therapy guarantees immunity. The point is that when reason is the therapeutic agent, it should not – in my opinion – be flushed out of the system along with the illness, as hellebore is, but should remain in the mind and contain and watch over our decisions. In its effects, the analogy for reason is not medicine, but nourishing food, since anyone who becomes accustomed to it gains energy and well-being from it, whereas when emotions are at a peak of fermentation, advice and reproof struggle long and hard for slight gains, and exactly resemble smelling-salts, which arouse people who have a fit and fall unconscious, but don’t get rid of the actual ailment.  
      <br>&emsp;Still, even at the time of their peak, all the other emotions do in a sense fall back and make way when reason with its reinforcements enters the mind from outside; but anger does not act in quite the way Melanthius says – ‘It displaces intelligence and then commits criminal acts’; in fact, it does so after having replaced intelligence altogether, and shut it out of the house. And then the situation is similar to when people burn to death in their houses, in the sense that anger makes the inside full of chaos, smoke and noise, with the result that the mind is incapable of seeing or hearing anything beneficial. This is why it is easier for an abandoned ship to take on a helmsman from outside in the middle of a storm and in the open sea, than it is for someone who is being tossed in the sea of fury and anger to accept reason from an external source, unless he has made his own rationality ready. People who anticipate a siege and expect no help from outside accumulate and amass all the useful things they can; similarly, it is particularly important for people to gather from far and wide everything philosophy has to offer that will help combat anger, and to store it up in the mind – because the time when the need is crucial is also when they will not readily find it possible to introduce such assistance. I mean, the din stops the mind even hearing anything external, unless the mind has reason of its own, like an internal ship’s boatswain who smartly picks up and understands every instruction; otherwise, even if the mind does hear anything, it despises quiet, gentle words and bridles at any which are more defiant. The point is that since a temper is arrogant, wilful and hard for an external agent to dislodge, it is like a secure tyranny which can be brought down only by an internal, inbred agent.  
      <br>&emsp;If anger becomes constant and resentment frequent, the mind acquires the negative condition known as irascibility, which results in prickliness, bitterness and a sour temper – that is, when the emotions become raw, easily distressed and hypercritical: think of a piece of iron which is already weak and thin being further filed. On the other hand, if rational discrimination immediately defies and bears down on any outburst of anger, it not only remedies the current situation, but also gives the mind energy and detachment for the future.  
      <br>&emsp;In my own case, at any rate, what happened is that once I had defied anger two or three times, I experienced what the Thebans did: once they had repulsed the apparently invincible Spartans for the first time, they were never subsequently defeated by them in battle. I mean, I gained the firm conviction that rationality can win. I saw that Aristotle’s claim that anger ends when cold water is sprinkled on it is not the whole story: it is also quenched when faced with fear. Moreover, of course, the onset of happiness frequently causes the instantaneous ‘melting’, to use Homer’s term, and dispersal of anger. The net result was that I became convinced that, provided the will is there, this emotion is not entirely irredeemable. You see, anger might well be aroused by something slight and meagre: often even a joke, a light-hearted remark, a laugh, a nod of assent, and so on and so forth, provoke anger. For example, when Helen addressed her niece as ‘Electra, long-time spinster’, she incited her remark, ‘You have taken your time to see sense; in the past you left your home in disgrace.’ And Callisthenes irritated Alexander by saying, when the large bowl was being passed around, ‘I don’t want to drink Alexander and then need Asclepius.’  
      <br>&emsp;Therefore, just as it is easy to control a flame which is starting to catch in hare’s fur or on a wick or in a pile of rubbish (whereas if it catches in a solid object with depth, it quickly destroys and devastates ‘with lively zest the lofty work of builders’, as Aeschylus puts it), so anyone who pays attention to the early stages of anger and is aware of it gradually starting to smoulder and ignite as a result of some remark or rubbishy sarcasm doesn’t need to exert himself a great deal, but often puts an end to it simply by keeping quiet and ignoring the remark. Anyone who doesn’t fuel a fire puts it out, and anyone who doesn’t feed anger in the early stages and doesn’t get into a huff is being prudent and is eliminating anger.  
      <br>&emsp;I was accordingly not happy with Hieronymus, despite his useful comments and advice elsewhere, when he claims that because of its speed, anger is not perceptible when it is arising, but only when it has arisen and already exists. I mean, all the emotions go through the phase of gaining mass and movement, but in none of them is this arising and growth so obvious. So Homer’s teaching on this is skilful: when he says, ‘So he spoke; and dark clouds of anguish overshadowed Achilles’, he is portraying Achilles as feeling sudden pain, when word reached him, with no lapse of time in between; but he portrays his anger at Agamemnon as slowly building up, and as gradually being ignited while a great number of words were being spoken. But if any of the people involved had withdrawn their words at the beginning and had resisted speaking them, their quarrel would not have escalated to such a degree and got so big. That is why whenever Socrates realized that he was getting too nasty to one of his friends, then because he was being driven ‘as it were before a storm on the crest of an ocean wave’, he used to lower his voice, smile and stop looking stern – and so keep himself upright and in control by counterbalancing the emotion and by moving instead in the opposite direction.  
      <br>&emsp;You see, my friend, there is a first-rate way to bring down our tyrant-like temper, which is not to listen or obey when it is ordering us to raise our voices, look fierce and beat our breasts, but to keep quiet and, as if the emotion were a disease, not aggravate it by thrashing and yelling. It may be that partying, singing and decorating doors – typical lovers’ behaviour – do somehow afford an alleviation which is not unpleasing or inelegant (‘I came, but did not call your name: I kissed your door. If this is a crime, I am a criminal’); and it may be that mourners eliminate a lot of their grief as well as their tears in the release of crying and weeping; but anger is made considerably more intense by the behaviour and speech of people in an angry state.  
      <br>&emsp;It is best, therefore, to keep calm, or alternatively to run away and hide and find refuge in silence, as though we realized that we were about to have a fit, and wanted to avoid falling, or rather falling on someone – and it is friends above all whom we most often fall on. We do not feel love or jealousy or fear for everyone, but anger leaves nothing alone, nothing in peace: we get angry at enemies and friends, at children and parents, and even at gods and animals and inanimate objects. For example, there is Thamyris, ‘breaking the gilded frame, breaking the structure of the strung lyre’; and Pandarus swearing harm against himself, if he failed to burn his bow ‘after shattering it with his bare hands’. And Xerxes even tried to brand and flog the sea, and sent a letter addressed to the mountain: ‘Great Athos high as heaven, don’t make huge, intractable rocks interfere with my actions, or else I will tear you to pieces and hurl you into the sea.’ Anger can often be terrifying – but often ridiculous: that is why it is the most hated and despised of the emotions; and it is useful to be aware of both of these aspects.  
      <br>&emsp;In my case, at any rate – I don’t know whether or not this is the correct way to go about it – I started my treatment as follows: just as the Spartans tried to understand drunkenness by watching their helots, I tried to understand anger by watching others. Hippocrates says that the severity of an illness is proportionate to the degree to which the patient’s features become abnormal, and the first thing I noticed was a similar proportion between the degree of distraction by anger and the degree to which appearance, complexion, gait and voice change. This impressed upon me a kind of image of the emotion, and I was very upset to think that I might ever look so terrifying and unhinged to my friends, wife and daughters – not only fierce and unrecognizable in appearance, but also speaking in as rough and harsh a tone as I encountered in others of my acquaintance, when anger made them incapable of preserving their usual nature, appearance, pleasant conversation and persuasiveness and courtesy in company.  
      <br>&emsp;The orator Gaius Gracchus had a brusque personality and used to speak rather too passionately, so he had one of those little pipes made for himself which musicians use to guide their voices gradually note by note in either direction. His slave used to hold this and stand behind him while he was speaking, and sound a moderate, gentle keynote which enabled Gracchus to revoke his stridency and get rid of the harshness and anger of his tone. Just as the cowherd’s ‘wax-joined reed pipes in clear tones a sleep-inducing tune’, so Gracchus’ slave mollified and allayed the orator’s anger.  
      <br>&emsp;If I had an ingenious attendant who was attuned to me, however, I would not be displeased if he employed a mirror during my outbursts of anger – as is occasionally done, though for no useful purpose, for people who have just bathed – since to see oneself in an unnatural state, all discomposed, plays a not unimportant part in discrediting the emotion. Indeed, there is an amusing story that once when Athena was playing the pipes, a satyr told her off by saying, ‘This expression doesn’t suit you. Put down your pipes, take up your weapons and compose your cheeks.’ She paid no attention, however, but when she saw in a river how her face looked, she got upset and threw away the pipes.  
      <br>&emsp;At least art is tasteful, and this distracts one’s attention from the ugliness. (Marsyas apparently used a kind of halter and a mouthpiece to channel the force of his breath, and to rectify and conceal the irregularity of his features – ‘gleaming gold joined the hair of one temple to the other and thongs, bound behind, he attached to his hard-working mouth’.) Anger, on the other hand, not only disfigures the features by inflating and distending them, but also makes one’s voice even more ugly and unpleasant, and ‘moves the unmoved strings of the heart’. I mean, when the sea has been whipped up by winds and disgorges kelp and seaweed, people say that it is being purified; but the undisciplined, harsh and snide remarks which anger casts ashore from a mind in turmoil pollute primarily the speakers, and contaminate them with the opprobrium of having always had these remarks inside them, bursting to get out, and of being exposed by their anger. That is why, as Plato says, they pay the heaviest of penalties for the lightest of things – a word – since they give the impression of being antisocial, slanderous and malicious.  
      <br>&emsp;So when I observe and notice all this, I end up committing to memory and reminding myself pretty constantly of the fact that although when feverish it is good to have a soft, smooth tongue, it is even better when angry. I mean, if the tongue of someone with a fever is unnatural, it is a bad sign, but it does not cause any further problems; but if the tongue of someone in a temper has become rough and offensive and inclined towards abnormal language, then it manifests an insolence which causes an incurable breakdown of relationships and which betrays festering unsociability. Anger is worse than undiluted wine at producing undisciplined and disagreeable results: wine’s results are blended with laughter, jokes and singing, while anger’s results are blended with bitter gall; and anyone who is silent while drinking is irritating and annoying to his companions, whereas there is nothing more dignified than silence while angry, as Sappho recommends: ‘When anger takes over your heart, guard your babbling tongue.’  
      <br>&emsp;However, constant attention to people who have been trapped by anger affords more than these reflections: it allows one to understand the nature of anger in other respects too, to see that it is not magnificent or manly, and that it has neither dignity nor grandeur. Nevertheless, most people mistake its turmoil for effectiveness, its menace for courage, its inflexibility for strength; and some people even call its callousness prowess, its stubbornness energy and its asperity righteous indignation. But this is wrong, because the actions, behaviour and conduct it prompts betray its pettiness and weakness. It is not just that angry people viciously assault little children, treat women harshly and think they should punish dogs, horses and mules (as Ctesiphon the pancratiast felt obliged to return his mule’s kick); it is also that the narrow intolerance of tyrants is obvious in their cruelty, and their state is betrayed by their behaviour, so that their bloodthirstiness resembles the bite of a snake which, when enraged and in agony, directs its extreme inflammation at anyone who has hurt it. When flesh is hit hard, a swelling occurs; likewise, the most infirm minds are most liable to pain, and consequently their anger is greater because their weakness is greater.  
      <br>&emsp;This is also why women are more irascible than men, and sick, old or unlucky people are more irascible than healthy, middle-aged or successful people. An avaricious person is very likely to get angry with his business manager, a glutton with his cook, a jealous man with his wife, a vain person when something bad has been said about him; but the worst of all are, as Pindar says, ‘political men who court ambition too much: they stir up open grief’. So it is from mental pain and suffering that anger arises, thanks above all to weakness; and whoever said that anger is, as it were, the mind’s sinews was wrong: it is the straining and spraining of a mind being unduly dislocated in the course of its defensive impulses.  
      <br>&emsp;Anyway, observing these despicable cases was not pleasant, but simply necessary. But because I regard people who cope with fits of anger in a calm and composed manner as outstanding both to hear about and to witness, my starting-point is to despise those who say, ‘You wronged a man: should a man put up with this?’, and ‘Tread him underfoot, tread on his neck, force him to the ground!’, and so on: these are provocative things to say, and some use them improperly to transpose anger from the women’s quarters to the men’s. I think that manly courage is compatible with morality in all other respects, but incompatible only where gentleness is concerned, because gentleness is more self-contained. It is possible for worse men to overcome better men, but to set up in one’s mind a trophy of victory over anger (which Heraclitus claims makes ‘a difficult opponent, since it purchases whatever it wants at the expense of the mind’) is a sign of great, overwhelming strength – a strength based on the faculties of rational judgement, which are the real sinews and muscles in the fight against the emotions.  
      <br>&emsp;That is why I constantly try to get hold of and read this kind of case, and not only when they are provided by philosophers (whom intelligent people regard as not being liable to gall), but even more when they are provided by kings and tyrants. For example, there is Antigonus’ behaviour towards some of his soldiers who were cursing him near his tent, and didn’t know he could hear them: ‘Oh dear,’ he said, poking his staff out of the tent and on to the ground, ‘can’t you go somewhere further away to criticize me?’  
      <br>&emsp;Arcadion the Achaean was always criticizing Philip and recommending escaping ‘to a place whose inhabitants are ignorant of Philip’. Then he happened to turn up in Macedonia, and Philip’s friends thought that he should punish him and not let him get away with it. Philip dealt with him kindly, however, and sent him presents and gifts; later he told his people to find out what report Arcadion had given to the Greeks. They all vouched for the fact that he had become an outstanding advocate of Philip, and Philip remarked, ‘So I am a better doctor than you!’ And once in Olympia some slander was being spread about him, and some people suggested that the Greeks ought to be made to suffer, since they were criticizing him despite his good treatment of them. ‘What will they do, then,’ he asked, ‘if I treat them badly?’  
      <br>&emsp;Also fine was Pisistratus’ behaviour towards Thrasybulus, Porsenna’s towards Mucius and Magas’ towards Philemon. Philemon made fun of Magas in one of his comedies, publicly in the theatre, with the lines: ‘Here’s a letter from the king for you to read, Magas … Poor Magas, what a pity you can’t read!’ Later, Philemon was forced into Paraetonium by a storm, and fell into Magas’ hands. Magas told a soldier to unsheathe a sword and simply touch Philemon on the neck with it, and then politely leave; and he sent him dice and a ball, as if he were a witless child, and then let him go.  
      <br>&emsp;Ptolemy was once mocking a scholar for his ignorance and asked him who Peleus’ father was; the scholar replied that he would tell him, if Ptolemy told him first who Lagus’ father was. His remark was a mocking reference to the king’s low- class birth, and everyone was offended, feeling that the remark jarred and was uncalled for. Ptolemy said, ‘If a king can’t take mockery, then he shouldn’t mock either.’  
      <br>&emsp;Alexander had been more harsh than usual in the affairs involving Callisthenes and Clitus. So when Porus was taken prisoner by Alexander he entreated him to deal with him as a king should. ‘Is that all?’ asked Alexander. ‘ “As a king should” covers everything,’ replied Porus. That is why ‘the benevolent’ is an epithet of the king of the gods (though the Athenians call him ‘the tempestuous’, I think): punishment is the work of the Furies and demigods – it is not divine and Olympian.  
      <br>&emsp;When Philip had levelled Olynthus, someone remarked, ‘But rebuilding an equivalent city will be beyond his capabilities’; likewise one might say to anger, ‘You’re good at demolition and destruction and ruination, but construction, preservation, mercy and patience require gentleness, forgiveness and moderation of passion: they require Camillus, Metellus, Aristides and Socrates, whereas plaguing and biting are what ants and mice do.’  
      <br>&emsp;Moreover, when I also consider vindictiveness, I find that anger’s version of it is ineffective, by and large: it exhausts itself in lip-chewing, tooth-grinding, empty assaults and curses consisting of mindless threats, and the result is as ridiculous as when children in a race fall down before they reach the goal for which they are striving, because they are not in control of themselves. It follows that the Rhodian put it nicely when he said to the Roman general’s servant, who was yelling and coming on strong, ‘I’m not bothered by your words, but by his silence.’ And once Sophocles has Neoptolemus and Eurypylus equipped with weapons, he says, ‘Without making boasts, without hurling insults, the two of them smashed into the massed bronze weaponry.’  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that although some savages treat their weapons with poison, courage has no need of bitter gall, since it is imbued with reason, whereas anger and rage are brittle and unsound. At any rate, the Spartans play pipes to quell anger in their men while they are fighting, and before a battle they sacrifice to the Muses to ensure the stable presence of reason; and if they rout the enemy, they do not set off in pursuit, but revoke their passion, which is like those handy-sized knives in that it is retractable and manageable. Anger, however, has caused many, many people to die before exacting their revenge: Cyrus and Pelopidas of Thebes are just two examples. Agathocles, on the other hand, good-temperedly put up with insults being hurled at him by the inhabitants of a city he was besieging, and when one of them asked, ‘Potter, where will you get the money to pay your mercenaries?’, he replied with a laugh, ‘Here, if I raze your city!’ Once some people mocked Antigonus for his deformity from their city walls, and he said to them, ‘But I thought I was good-looking!’ But when he had taken the city, he sold the mockers into slavery, and swore that he would keep in touch with their masters, to see if they ever insulted him again.  
      <br>&emsp;I also notice that anger makes lawyers and orators commit great mistakes; and Aristotle records that the friends of Satyrus of Samos blocked his ears with wax when he was in court, in case he messed things up by getting angry at being abused by his opponents. As for ourselves, don’t we often bungle the punishment of a slave who is misbehaving, because they get frightened at our threats and at what we are saying, and run away? Nurses say to children, ‘Stop crying and you can have it’, and we could usefully address anger in the same way: ‘Simmer down, shut up, slow down, and you will improve the chances and the probability of getting what you want.’ I mean, if a father sees his child trying to cut or carve something with a knife, he takes the knife himself and does it; and if the rational mind takes over from anger the job of retribution, then the person who deserves it receives the punishment, and the rational mind remains safe and sound and valuable, instead of being punished itself, which is what often happens thanks to anger.  
      <br>&emsp;All the emotions need schooling, to tame (so to speak) and discipline by training the part of oneself that is irrational and recalcitrant; but one’s servants provide a better training ground for anger than for any other emotion. The point is that our dealings with servants contain no element of envy, fear or rivalry, and constantly getting angry with them causes a lot of conflict and error and, because we have power over them, our anger puts us on a slippery downward slope, as it were, with no one to stand in our way and restrain us. I mean, absolute control cannot fail to be liable to error when emotion is involved: the only solution is to use considerable restraint to restrict your power and to resist the frequent complaints of wife and friends, as they accuse you of being weak and feeble.  
      <br>&emsp;I myself used to get very needled at my servants because of these accusations, and used to believe that by not punishing them I was spoiling them. But eventually I realized, first, that it is better to make them worse by patiently tolerating their badness than to concentrate on correcting others while allowing harshness and anger to corrupt oneself. And second, I saw plenty of cases where, precisely because they were not being punished, they were ashamed of being bad, let forbearance rather than retaliation initiate change in them and, I assure you, more enthusiastically served those who quietly sanctioned their actions than those who used flogging and branding: all this convinced me that reason is more authoritative than passion. The poet got it wrong when he said, ‘Where there is fear, respect follows too.’ It is actually the other way round: respect engenders in people the kind of fear which entails self-restraint, while non-stop, relentless flogging does not instil remorse for past misdeeds, but rather the intention to get away with it in the future.  
      <br>&emsp;In the third place, I constantly remind myself and bear in mind that when we were learning archery, we were not told not to shoot, but not to miss; likewise, learning how to punish in a well-timed, moderate, beneficial and appropriate way will not stop one punishing altogether. So I try to quell my anger above all by not denying the defendants the right to justify themselves, but by listening to what they have to say. This helps because time checks emotion and gives it space to dissolve, and also because rationality finds what method of punishment is appropriate, and how much is fitting. Moreover, the person who gets his just deserts has no excuse left for resisting correction, given that he is being punished not in anger, but because he has been convicted; and the most shameful factor is excluded, which is when the servant has a more just case than the master.  
      <br>&emsp;After Alexander’s death, Phocion tried to stop the Athenians revolting too soon, or too readily trusting the news, by saying, ‘If he is dead today, citizens of Athens, then he will be dead tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.’ In the same way, in my opinion, anyone being driven headlong towards retaliation by anger ought to whisper to himself, ‘If he is guilty today, then he will be guilty tomorrow and the day after tomorrow; and no harm will be done if he gets his just deserts later rather than sooner, but if he goes through it quickly, there will always – it has often happened in the past – be uncertainty as to his guilt.’ I mean, which of us is horrible enough to flog and punish a slave for having five or ten days ago burned a savoury or knocked over a table or been rather slow to obey an order? But these are the things which make us upset and harsh and pitiless when they have just occurred and when they are still in the recent past. Solid objects seem bigger when it is misty, and the same happens to things when one is angry.  
      <br>&emsp;Our first reaction, therefore, should be to remember facts like this; and if in the clear, steady light of reason the deed still seems bad, when there is no doubt that we are free of the emotion, then we should attend to it: we should not at this later date neglect or abandon the punishment, as we do food when we have lost our appetite. Nothing is so conducive to doling out punishment when anger is upon us as having failed to punish, having let the issue drop, when anger had left us: the experience is identical to that of lazy rowers, who lie at anchor when the weather is calm and then run the risks of a voyage when the wind is up. We too accuse rationality of being weak and feeble when it comes to punishment, and so rush on recklessly before the wind of anger when it comes.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that it is proper for someone who is hungry to engage in eating, but it is proper for someone who is neither hungry nor thirsty for it to engage in retribution. He should not need anger in order to punish, as he might need a savoury, but it is essential that he waits until he has greatly distanced himself from the appetite for punishment and introduced rationality instead . Aristotle records that in his time servants were flogged in Tyrrhenia to the accompaniment of pipes; but we should not follow suit and, for the sake of personal pleasure, be driven by a desire for satisfaction, as it were, to gorge ourselves with retaliation – to enjoy punishing (which is to behave like an animal), and then regret it later (which is to behave like a woman). Rather, we should wait until there is no trace of either pleasure or distress, and rationality is present, and then take reprisal without being motivated at all by anger.  
      <br>&emsp;Anyway, as may be obvious, this is not a cure for anger, but a means of postponing and protecting oneself against making mistakes while angry (despite the fact that, as Hieronymus says, although a swollen spleen is a symptom of fever, reducing the swelling alleviates the fever). But when I was trying to see how anger actually starts, I noticed that although different factors trigger its onset in different people, there is almost always present a belief that they are being slighted and ignored. It follows that we should help people who are trying to evade anger by putting the greatest possible distance between any given action and contempt or arrogance, by attributing the action instead to ignorance or necessity or emotion or accident. As Sophocles says, ‘My lord, unfortunate people find that even their innate intelligence has no stability, but deserts them.’ And Agamemnon attributes his theft of Briseis to his being possessed, but still says, ‘I want to make amends and give you vast gifts of recompense.’  
      <br>&emsp;The point of this quote is that no one can make an appeal to someone if he despises him; and by being demonstrably humble, the offender gets rid of any impression of contempt. But anyone who is angry should not just wait for this to happen, but should of his own accord cling to what Diogenes said: ‘Those people are laughing at you, Diogenes,’ someone said; ‘But I don’t feel laughed at,’ he replied. So anyone who is angry should not think that he is being despised, but should rather despise the other person, on the grounds that his offence was caused by weakness, impetuosity, laziness, meanness, old age or youth.  
      <br>&emsp;However, our dealings with servants and friends must be completely free of this impression, since contempt for us as powerless or as ineffective plays no part in their attitude towards us: our servants regard us as good, on the assumption that we are fair to them, and our friends regard us as their friends, on the assumption that we are affectionate towards them. In fact, however, it is not only wife, servants and friends that we behave harshly towards because we think we are despised by them, but the same idea often brings us into angry conflict with innkeepers, sailors and drunken muleteers, and makes us get cross with dogs for barking at us and donkeys for bumping into us. We are just like the man who wanted to hit a donkey driver, and then when he shouted, ‘I’m an Athenian citizen’, he said to the donkey, ‘Well, you aren’t’, and began hitting it and raining blows on it.  
      <br>&emsp;Now, those continuous, constant feelings of anger which gradually gather in the mind like a swarm of bees or wasps are engendered in us above all by self-regard and discontent, coupled with a luxurious and enervating way of life. It follows that there is no more important means of promoting kind behaviour towards one’s servants, wife and friends than being easy to please and having a simple lifestyle, as a result of the ability to adapt oneself to immediate circumstances and not to need a lot of extras. On the other hand, ‘anyone whose discontent makes him critical, if his food is over-baked or over-boiled, or under-or over- or medium-seasoned’, and who can’t have a drink without ice, or eat shop-bought bread, or take a morsel of food served on plain or earthenware dishes, or sleep on a mattress unless it billows like the sea in a deep swell, and who flogs and beats his table servants, forcing them to hurry, making them rush about, create a hubbub and work up a sweat as if they were bringing poultices for boils – anyone like this is enslaved to a feeble, nit-picking, complaining way of life, and fails to realize that he is creating for his temper the kind of raw and oozing condition which a chronic cough or constantly bumping into things causes. So we must train the body, by means of frugality, to be self-sufficient and hence easily pleased, because people who want little are seldom disappointed.  
      <br>&emsp;Food should be our starting-point: it is no great hardship quietly to make do with what is to hand, and not worry and fuss about a considerable proportion of our food, which imposes upon ourselves and our companions the most disagreeable flavouring of all – anger. ‘It is impossible to conceive of a less pleasant meal’ than when servants are beaten and wife is cursed because something is burned or smoky or has insufficient salt, or because the bread is too cold. Arcesilaus once had some visitors staying and he invited friends over to dinner, but when the meal was served, there was no bread, because the servants had forgotten to buy any – which would make anyone scream loud enough to crack the walls! But Arcesilaus smiled and said, ‘It’s a good thing that intellectuals like a drinks party!’  
      <br>&emsp;Socrates once brought Euthydemus home from the wrestling-school, and Xanthippe laid into them angrily, hurled insults at them and eventually overturned the table. Euthydemus was very upset, and got up to go, but Socrates said, ‘When we were at your house the other day, a hen flew in and did exactly the same, but we didn’t get cross, did we?’  
      <br>&emsp;We should welcome friends gladly, with smiles and affection – without scowling and without instilling fear and trepidation in our servants. And we should also condition ourselves to be happy to use any utensils, and not to have preferences: some people (including Marius, we hear), having once chosen one particular goblet or cup, refuse to drink out of any other, even when they have plenty available; others are the same way about oil-flasks and strigils, and love one set above all others; and then, when any of these special things gets broken or lost, they can hardly bear it and they resort to punishment. So anyone whose weakness is anger should get rid of rare and unusual things like cups, rings and precious stones, since their loss is more unsettling than the loss of common, everyday things. That is why, when Nero had an amazingly beautiful and lavish octagonal tent made, Seneca said, ‘You are a self-convicted pauper, because this tent is irreplace- able if lost.’ And in fact the tent was lost, as it happened, when its ship went down; but Nero remembered what Seneca had said, and did not get too upset.  
      <br>&emsp;Being unfussy about mundane things makes one unfussy and gentle with one’s servants; and if one is gentle with one’s servants, then obviously one will also be gentle with one’s friends and dependants. It is noticeable that the first thing slaves try to find out about their new owner, after they have been bought, is not whether he is liable to superstition or envy, but whether he has a temper. In fact, it is generally true that where anger is present, husbands cannot tolerate their wives’ impassivity, or wives their husbands’ passion, or friends one another’s familiarity. So when anger is present, neither marriage nor friendship is endurable; but when anger is absent, even drunkenness is no burden. Dionysus’ wand provides punishment enough for anyone who gets drunk, unless anger intrudes and imbues the wine with the god of cruelty and madness, rather than of ecstasy and dance. Anticyra cures straightforward insanity, but the combination of madness and anger is the stuff of tragedy and myth.  
      <br>&emsp;We should eliminate anger from our lighter moments, because it imposes enmity on affability; from our discussions, because it turns love of debating into love of disputing; from our decision-making, because it tinges authority with arrogance; when we are teaching, because it instils lack of confidence and a distaste for rationality; when we are doing well, because it promotes envy; when we are doing badly, because it deters sympathy by making people fight irritably with anyone commiserating with them. Priam is an example of this, with his ‘Go away, you vile wretches! Haven’t you got problems of your own? Why have you come to bother me?’  
      <br>&emsp;Being easy to please, on the other hand, is either a help or an embellishment or a delight, and its gentleness overcomes anger and discontent of all kinds. Consider Euclides, for instance: when his brother ended an argument by saying, ‘I’ll get my own back on you, if it’s the last thing I do’, Euclides replied, ‘I’ll win you over, if it’s the last thing I do’, and immediately made him alter course and change his mind. And Polemon was once being cursed by a man who was fond of precious stones and obsessed with costly rings; Polemon did not respond at all, but began to study one of the man’s rings closely. So the man felt pleased and said, ‘You’ll get a far better impression of it, Polemon, if you examine it in sunlight rather than here.’  
      <br>&emsp;Once Aristippus was angry with Aeschines, and someone asked, ‘What’s happened to Aeschines’ and your friendship, Aristippus?’ He replied, ‘It’s sleeping, but I’ll wake it up.’ He went to Aeschines and said, ‘Do you think there’s absolutely no chance for me, no hope at all? Is that why you don’t tell me off?’ And Aeschines’ response was: ‘Given that you’re inherently better than me in all respects, it’s not at all surprising that you were the first to see what to do.’  
      <br>&emsp;It has been said that ‘A new-born child, stroking a bristle-maned boar with his young hand, may – and so may a woman – bring him down more easily than any wrestler.’ We, however, domesticate and tame wild creatures, and carry wolf and lion cubs around in our arms, but then under the influence of anger we reject children, friends and acquaintances; and we use our anger like a wild beast to assault our servants and fellow citizens, and misguidedly gloss over it as ‘righteous indignation’. There is no difference, in my opinion, between this and calling other mental affections and afflictions ‘foresight’ or ‘independence’ or ‘respect’: it cannot free us from any of them.  
      <br>&emsp;Now, Zeno used to say that seed is a compound, a mixture of extracts from all the faculties which make up a person’s nature; and analogously, anger seems to be a kind of conglomerate of emotional seeds. It contains elements extracted from pain and pleasure and arrogance; it has the gloating pleasure of spite, and also gets its method of grappling from spite, in the sense that the avoidance of its own suffering is not the purpose of its efforts, but it accepts harm to itself while destroying the other person; and one of its ingredients is the form of desire which is the most disagreeable of all, the longing to hurt someone else. When we approach reprobates’ houses, we hear a pipe-girl playing at dawn and the sights that greet our eyes are, to quote, ‘sediment of wine and shreds of garlands’ and inebriated servants at the door; but the fact that the longing to hurt others is an aspect of anger explains why you will see the manifest signs of cruel and irascible people on the faces and in the identification tattoos and chains of their servants; and ‘wailing is the only constant refrain to arise in the house’ of an angry man – the wailing of estate-managers being flogged and serving-women having their arms twisted inside the house; and the consequence of all this is that anger is pitiful to anyone who can see that its desires and its pleasures involve pain.  
      <br>&emsp;Despite what has been said, anyone who is commonly susceptible to anger because of genuine righteous indignation must rid himself of the excessive, unmitigated part of his anger, along with his overconfidence in the people he comes across. This overconfidence is one of the chief causes of the aggravation of anger, which is what happens when someone assumed to be good turns out to be bad, or when a supposed friend gets cross or critical. In my own case, I’m sure you know how much I am naturally inclined towards thinking well of people and trusting them. It is like when you take a step, but there is nothing there to tread on: the more I commit myself to being friendly, the more I go wrong and get hurt by my mistakes. I might well not be able at this late stage to lessen this excessive susceptibility to and enthusiasm for friendship; but I can use Plato’s words of warning to bridle my overconfidence. Plato says that his praise for the mathematician Helicon is couched the way it is because Helicon is a member of an inherently inconstant species; and he claims to be right to be wary of people brought up in his city, because since they are human and the offspring of humans, they might at any time reveal the weakness inherent in their nature.  
      <br>&emsp;However, Sophocles’ assertion that ‘Most aspects of humanity will be found on investigation to be contemptible’ seems excessively harsh and restrictive. Still, the pessimistic, carping tone of this judgement does make us less liable to anger and its consequent disruptiveness; I mean, it is what is unexpected and unforeseen that throws us. We should (as Panaetius said at one point) make use of the attitude summed up in Anaxagoras’ dictum: when his son died, he said, ‘I knew that I had fathered a mortal.’ Likewise, whenever we get irritated by someone’s mistakes, we should comment, ‘I knew that the slave I bought was unintelligent’, or ‘I knew that my friend was not flawless’, or ‘I knew that my wife was a woman.’ And if one also keeps reiterating Plato’s saying, ‘Am I not like that too?’, he will turn his thinking inward instead of outward, and will interrupt his complaining with caution, and will consequently not employ a great deal of righteous indignation towards others when he sees that he himself requires a lot of forbearance. But as it is, every one of us gets angry and lashes out, and sounds like Aristides and Cato: ‘Stop stealing!’, ‘Don’t tell lies!’, ‘Why are you slacking?’ And the most despicable thing of all is that we angrily reprimand others for being angry, and we furiously punish others for mistakes made because they were infuriated: we do not behave like doctors who ‘use bitter medicine to flush out bitter bile’, but we aggravate and exacerbate the condition.  
      <br>&emsp;At the same time as bearing in mind these considerations, I also try to cut back a bit on my nosiness. I mean, knowing every single detail about everything, investigating and eliciting a slave’s every occupation, a friend’s every action, a son’s every pastime, a wife’s every whisper – this leads to many outbursts of anger, one after another every day, and these in turn add up to habitual discontent and surliness. Although Euripides is right to say that it is when things get out of hand that God ‘intervenes, while leaving minor matters to chance’, I still think that a sensible person ought to entrust nothing to chance, and ought to ignore nothing: he should trust and make use of his wife for some matters, his servants for others and his friends for others (just as a ruler trusts and makes use of overseers, accountants and managers), while being himself, by virtue of his rationality, in charge of the most far-reaching and important matters. For just as tiny writing irritates the eyes, so the extra strain of trivial matters chafes and unsettles one’s temper, and it acquires a habit which is detrimental when more important matters are at stake.  
      <br>&emsp;All in all, therefore, I began to think that Empedocles’ dictum ‘Observe a fast from evil’ is crucial and inspired; furthermore, not just because they are agreeable, but also because they are not irrelevant to the practice of philosophy, I began to commend those familiar pacts, pledged with devotion, such as to honour God with one’s self-control, by keeping oneself for a year untainted by sex and alcohol; or again to refrain from lying for a prescribed period of time, by paying attention to oneself to make sure that one always tells the truth, in both unguarded and serious moments.  
      <br>&emsp;And then I compared my own pledge with these, and found it just as pleasing to God and just as sacred. My pledge was to begin by spending a few days doing the equivalent of going without drinking and alcohol – avoiding anger, and doing so as if I were pouring ritual libations of water and of honey, but not of wine; and then to spend a month, two months, doing this … In this way, by experimenting on myself, the period of time gradually got longer and I progressed towards increased tolerance, by using self-control to pay attention to myself and to keep myself composed and imperturbable – maintaining a holy silence – and to remain untainted by pernicious speech, unnatural actions and emotion. Emotion leads, for the sake of a form of pleasure which is small in quantity and disagreeable in quality, to enormous mental confusion and the most despicable remorse. And this, I think, is why (with God’s assistance too) my experience tends to clarify the meaning of the well-known view that this composure, calmness and charity is nowhere near as kind and considerate and inoffensive to those who come across it as it is to those who possess it.

      I hope this finds you well. The man you sent to give me the news of our child’s death seems to have missed me during his overland journey to Athens, but I heard about it from my granddaughter when I got to Tanagra. I imagine that the burial rites are over by now, and I hope they were conducted in a way that makes the chance of your feeling distress at the burial both now and in the future as remote as possible. But if there is something you haven’t yet done, even though you want to, because you are waiting to hear what I intend to do, and it is something which you think would make things easier to bear, then it will happen too, with no fuss and superstitious nonsense – not that you are at all liable to these faults.  
      <br>&emsp;All I ask, my dear, is that while reacting emotionally you make sure that both of us – me as well as you – remain in a stable state. I mean, the actual event is a known quantity and I can keep it within limits, but if I find your distress excessive, this will discompose me more than what has happened. Nevertheless, I was not born ‘from oak or rock’, as you yourself know, given that you have been my partner in bringing up so many children – all brought up with no one else’s help in our own home – and I know how overjoyed you were with the birth, after four sons, of the daughter you longed for and with the fact that it gave me the opportunity to name her after you. In addition, one’s love for children of that age is peculiarly acute, since the pleasure it affords is absolutely unsullied and untainted by any element of anger and criticism. Also, she was inherently wonderfully easy to please and undemanding, and the way she repaid affection with affection and was so charming was not only delightful, but also made one realize how unselfish she was. She used to encourage her wet-nurse to offer and present her breast not only to other babies, but also to her favourite playthings and toys: she was unselfishly trying to share the good things she had and the things she most enjoyed with her favourites, as if they were guests at her very own table.  
      <br>&emsp;However, my dear, I fail to see any reason why, when this and similar behaviour pleased us during her life, it should upset and trouble us when we recall it now. I worry about the alternative, however – that we might consign the memory of her to oblivion along with our distress. This would be to act like Clymene, who said, ‘I hate the curved cornel bow! I wish there were no gymnasia!’: she was always nervous about recalling her son, and avoided doing so, because distress was its companion, and it is natural to avoid anything painful. No, our daughter was the sweetest thing in the world to hug and watch and listen to, and by the same token she must remain and live on in our thoughts, and bring not just more, but a great deal more pleasure than distress – if it is plausible to expect that the arguments we have often deployed on others will help us in our hour of need – and we must not slump in dejection or shut ourselves away and so pay for those pleasures with distress that vastly outweighs it.  
      <br>&emsp;People who were with you also tell me, with some surprise, that you haven’t adopted mourning clothes, that you didn’t make yourself or your maids follow any ugly or harrowing practices and that the paraphernalia of an expensive celebration was absent from the funeral – that instead everything was conducted with discretion and in silence, and with only the essential accoutrements. It was no surprise to me, however, that you who never tricked yourself out for the theatre or a public procession, and never saw any point in extravagance even where your pleasures were concerned, maintained unaffectedness and frugality in sad circumstances.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that Bacchic rites are not the only circumstances which require a decent woman to remain uncorrupted: she should equally assume that the instability and emotional disturbance which grief entails call for self-control, which is not, as is popularly supposed, the enemy of affection and love, but of mental indulgence. Affection is what we gratify by missing, valuing and remembering the dead, but the insatiable desire for grief – a desire which makes us wail and howl – is just as contemptible as hedonistic indulgence, despite the notion that it is forgivable because, although it may be contemptible, it is accompanied not by any pleasure gained from the desire, but rather by distress and pain. Could there be anything more absurd than banishing excesses of laughter and mirth, and yet allowing the floodgates of tears and lamentation, which spring from the same source as merriment, to open to their fullest extent? Or – as some husbands do – quarrelling with their wives about extravagant hair perfume and gaudy clothing, and yet submitting when they cut off their hair in mourning, dye their clothes black and adopt ugly postures when sitting and uncomfortable ones when reclining at table? Or – and this is the most irritating of all – resisting and restraining their wives if they punish their servants of either sex excessively and unfairly, and yet ignoring the vicious, harsh punishments they inflict upon themselves when they are under the influence of emotion and misfortunes which actually call for a relaxed and charitable attitude?  
      <br>&emsp;Our relationship, however, my dear, is such that there never has been any occasion for us to quarrel on the one score, and there never will be any occasion for us to quarrel on the other, I am sure. On the one hand, every philosopher who has spent time with us and got to know us has been impressed with the inextravagance of your clothing and make-up, and with the modesty of your lifestyle, and every one of our fellow citizens has witnessed your unaffectedness during rituals and sacrifices and at the theatre. On the other hand, you have already demonstrated in the past that you can remain stable under these circumstances, when you lost your eldest child and again when our lovely Charon left us before his time. I remember that I brought visitors with me on my journey from the coast at the news of the child’s death, and that they and everyone else gathered in our house. As they subsequently told others as well, when they saw how calm and peaceful it was, they thought that nothing terrible had happened and that a baseless rumour had got out, because you had behaved so responsibly in arranging the house at a time when disarray is normally excusable, despite the fact that you had nursed him at your own breast and had endured an operation when your nipple got inflamed, which are noble acts stemming from motherly love.  
      <br>&emsp;It is noticeable that most mothers take their children into their arms as if they were playthings (after others have cleaned them and smartened them up), and then, if the children die, these mothers wallow in empty, indecent grief. They are not motivated by warmth of feeling, which is a reasonable and commendable emotion: their strong inclination towards shallow beliefs, plus a dash of instinctive emotion, causes outbursts of grief which are fierce, manic and unruly. Aesop was apparently aware of this: he said that when Zeus was distributing recognition among the gods, Grief asked for some as well; so Zeus allowed Grief to be acknowledged – but only by people who deliberately wanted to acknowledge it.  
      <br>&emsp;This is certainly what happens at the beginning: only an individual lets grief enter himself; but after a while it becomes a permanent sibling, a habitual presence, and then it doesn’t leave however much one wants it to. That is why it is crucial to resist it on the threshold and not to adopt special clothing or haircuts or anything else like that, which allow it to establish a stronghold. These things challenge the mind day in and day out, make it recoil, belittle it and constrict it and imprison it, and make it unresponsive and apprehensive, as if the wearing of these clothes and the adoption of these practices out of grief cut it off from laughter and light and the sociability of the table. The consequences of this affliction are physical neglect and an aversion to oiling and bathing the body and to other aspects of the daily regimen, when exactly the opposite should happen: purely mental suffering ought to be helped by physical fitness. Mental distress abates and subsides to a great extent when it is dispersed in physical calm, as waves subside in fair weather, but if as a result of a bad regimen the body becomes sordid and foul and transmits to the mind nothing benign or beneficial, but only the harsh and unpleasant fumes of pain and distress, then even those who desire it find that recovery becomes hard to achieve. These are the kinds of disorders that take possession of the mind when it is treated so badly.  
      <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I have no cause to worry about the worst and most worrying disorder which occurs in such cases – ‘the invasion of malignant women’, with the cries and expressions of sympathy which they use to polish and hone distress, and to prevent its being diminished either by external factors or of its own accord. For I know about the battles you recently had when you went to assist Theon’s sister and defended her against the incursions of the women who came with their weeping and wailing – behaviour which is exactly the same as fighting fire with fire. I mean, when people see a friend’s house on fire, then everyone contributes what he can to put it out as quickly as possible; but when that same friend’s mind is on fire, they bring fuel! And although when someone has an eye infection, people don’t let just anyone touch it or treat the inflammation, people who are grieving sit and let everyone who comes by prod at their running sore, so to speak, and aggravate the condition, until instead of being an insignificant itching irritation, it erupts into a seriously disagreeable affliction. Anyway, I know that you will be on your guard against this.  
      <br>&emsp;Please try, however, to use your mind as a vehicle for often returning to the time when this child of ours had not yet been born and we had no reason to blame fortune; and then connect that time with the present, and imagine that our circumstances are no different again. You see, my dear, we will seem to regret that our child was ever born if we find more to complain about now than in the situation before her birth. We must not erase the intervening two years from our memories, but since they brought happiness and joy, we must count them as pleasant. The good was brief, but should not therefore be regarded as a long-term bad influence; and we should not be ungrateful for what we received just because our further hopes were dashed by fortune.  
      <br>&emsp;The point is that a reverential attitude towards the gods and being charitable and uncomplaining with regard to fortune always yield a dividend which is both fine and enjoyable, and anyone who, in a situation like ours, makes a particular point of highlighting the memory of good things and turning his mind away from the dark and disturbing aspects of his life towards the bright and brilliant ones instead either completely extinguishes whatever it is that is causing him pain, or at least decreases and obscures it by blending it with its opposite. Perfume is always nice to smell, but it is also an antidote to unpleasant odours; likewise, bearing good things in mind serves the extra purpose of essential support, in times of trouble, for people who are not afraid to recall good times and do not critically hold fortune entirely responsible for every bad thing that happens. And that is a condition we should avoid – the syndrome of whingeing if the book of our life has a single smudge while every other page is perfectly clean. I mean, you have often been told that happiness is a consequence of correctly using the rational mind for the goal of a stable state, and that if it is a chance event which causes one to deviate, this does not constitute a major reversal and does not mean that the edifice of one’s life has collapsed and been demolished.  
      <br>&emsp;Suppose that we too were to follow the usual practice of being guided by external circumstances, of keeping a tally of events due to fortune and of relying on any casual assessment of whether or not we are happy: even so, you should not take into consideration the current weeping and wailing of your visitors, which is trotted out on each and every occasion, prompted by pointless social customs. You would be better off bearing in mind that they continue to envy you for your children, your home and your way of life. As long as there are others who would gladly choose your fate, even including our present upset, it is awful for you, as the bearer of the fate, to complain and grumble, instead of letting the very source of your pain bring you to the realization of how much we have to be grateful for in what we still have. Otherwise, you will resemble those people who pick out Homer’s headless and tapering lines, and ignore the many extensive passages of outstanding composition: if you do this, and nitpickingly whinge about the bad features of your life, and gloss over the good points in a vague and sweeping fashion, you will be behaving like those mean and avaricious people who build up a considerable hoard and don’t make use of what they get, but still moan and grumble when they lose it.  
      <br>&emsp;If you feel sorry about our daughter dying before she was able to marry and have children, then again you can find other reasons for cheering yourself up, in that you have known and experienced both these states: I mean, they cannot simultaneously be significant and insignificant blessings, depending on whether or not one has been deprived of them! And the fact that she has gone to a place of no pain ought not to be a source of pain to us. Why should she cause us to suffer, if there is nothing that can now cause her pain? Even huge losses cease to be a source of distress when the point is reached at which the objects are no longer missed, and your Timoxena suffered only minor losses, since what she was familiar with and what she found pleasure in were not things of great importance. And as for things she was unaware of, which had never entered her mind or caught her fancy – how could she be said to have lost them?  
      <br>&emsp;Then there is that other idea you’ve come across, which is commonly accepted, that it is quite impossible for anything to harm or distress something which has been dissolved. But I know that both the doctrine we’ve inherited from our ancestors and the maxims of the Dionysian Mysteries (which those of us who are in the group are privy to) prevent you believing this idea. So, since the soul cannot be destroyed, you can compare what happens to it to the behaviour of caged birds: if it has made a physical body its home for an extended period of time, and has allowed a plethora of material events and long familiarity to domesticate it to this way of life, then it resumes its perch inside a body and doesn’t let go or stop its involvement, through rebirth after rebirth, with worldly conditions and fortunes. If old age is the butt of calumny and slurs, you should appreciate that this is not because of wrinkles, grey hair and physical enfeeblement: no, its most cruel feature is that it makes the soul lose touch with its memories of the other world, attaches it to this one, wraps it and constricts it (since it retains the shape it gained while it was acted on by the body). On the other hand, a soul which, although captured, remains only a short while in a body before being released by the gods and departing, springs back up to its natural state as if, although it had been bent, it retained its suppleness and malleability. Just as fire is quickly rekindled again and returns to its former state if it is relit straight after being extinguished, but the longer the interval, the harder it is to relight, so too the most fortunate soul is the one which is able, in the poet’s words, ‘to pass as swiftly as possible through Hades’ portals’, before a strong love of the things of this world has been engendered in it and before it has become moulded to the body by being softened and melted as if by chemicals.  
      <br>&emsp;Our ancient ancestral customs and rules are a better guide to the truth in these matters. People do not pour libations for their infant children when they die or perform any of the other rites that in other cases one is expected to perform for the dead, because babies have not been pervaded by earth or any earthly things. Again, people do not linger over their burial or at their grave or in laying out their bodies, because the laws regarding death at that age do not allow it, on the grounds that it is irreligious to grieve for those who have exchanged this world for a fate, and a place too, that is better and more divine. Since mistrusting these laws is more problematic than trusting them, let us make sure that our external actions conform to their injunctions, and that our internal state is even more untainted, pure and restrained than our external activity.

      <div class="content-text hidden" id="ShortnessLife">
         Most human beings, Paulinus,* complain about the meanness of nature, because we are born for a brief span of life,
         and because this spell of time that has been given to us rushes by so swiftly and rapidly that with very few
         exceptions life ceases for the rest of us just when we are getting ready for it. Nor is it just the man in the street
         and the unthinking mass of people who groan over this - as they see it - universal evil: the same feeling lies behind
         complaints from even distinguished men. Hence the dictum of the greatest of doctors:f ‘Life is short, art is long.’
         Hence too the grievance, most improper to a wise man, which Aristotle expressed when he was taking nature to task for
         indulging animals with such long existences that they can live through five or ten human lifetimes, while a far
         shorter limit is set for men who are born to a great and extensive destiny. It is not that we have a short time to
         live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for
         the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good
         activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was
         passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of
         it. Just as when ample and princely wealth falls to a bad owner it is squandered in a moment, but wealth however
         modest, if entrusted to a good custodian, increases with use, so our lifetime extends amply if you manage it
         properly.
         <br>&emsp;Why do we complain about nature? She has acted kindly: life is long if you know how to use it. But one man
         is gripped by insatiable greed, another by a laborious dedication to useless tasks. One man is soaked in wine,
         another sluggish with idleness. One man is worn out by political ambition, which is always at the mercy of the
         judgement of others. Another through hope of profit is driven headlong over all lands and seas by the greed of
         trading. Some are tormented by a passion for army life, always intent on inflicting dangers on others or anxious
         about danger to themselves. Some are worn out by the self-imposed servitude of thankless attendance on the great.
         Many are occupied by either pursuing other people’s money or complaining about their own. Many pursue no fixed goal,
         but are tossed about in everchanging designs by a fickleness which is shifting, inconstant and never satisfied with
         itself. Some have no aims at all for their life’s course, but death takes them unawares as they yawn languidly - so
         much so that I cannot doubt the truth of that oracular remark of the greatest of poets: ‘It is a small part of life
         we really live.’ Indeed, all the rest is not life but merely time. Vices surround and assail men from every side, and
         do not allow them to rise again and lift their eyes to discern the truth, but keep them overwhelmed and rooted in
         their desires. Never can they recover their true selves. If by chance they achieve some tranquillity, just as a swell
         remains on the deep sea even after the wind has dropped, so they go on tossing about and never find rest from their
         desires. Do you think I am speaking only of those whose wickedness is acknowledged? Look at those whose good fortune
         people gather to see: they are choked by their own blessings. How many find their riches a burden! How many burst a
         blood vessel by their eloquence and their daily striving to show off their talents! How many are pale from constant
         pleasures! How many are left no freedom by the crowd of clients surrounding them! In a word, run through them all,
         from lowest to highest: one calls for legal assistance, another comes to help; one is on trial, another defends him,
         another gives a judgment; no one makes his claim to himself, but each is exploited for another’s sake. Ask about
         those whose names are learned by heart, and you will see that they have these distinguishing marks: X cultivates Y
         and Y cultivates Z - no one bothers about himself. Again, certain people reveal the most stupid indignation: they
         complain about the pride of their superiors because they did not have time to give them an audience when they wanted
         one. But can anyone dare to complain about another’s pride when he himself never has time for himself? Yet whoever
         you are, the great man has sometimes gazed upon you, even if his look was patronizing, he has bent his ears to your
         words, he has let you walk beside him. But you never deign to look at yourself or listen to yourself. So you have no
         reason to claim credit from anyone for those attentions, since you showed them not because you wanted someone else’s
         company but because you could not bearyour own.
         <br>&emsp;Even if all the bright intellects who ever lived were to agree to ponder this one theme, they would never
         sufficiently express their surprise at this fog in the human mind. Men do not let anyone seize their estates, and if
         there is the slightest dispute about their boundaries they rush to stones and arms; but they allow others to encroach
         on their lives - why, they themselves even invite in those who will take over their lives. You will find no one
         willing to share out his money; but to how many does each of us divide up his life ! People are frugal in guarding
         their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which
         it is right to be stingy. So, I would like to fasten on someone from the older generation and say to him: ‘I see that
         you have come to the last stage of human life; you are close upon your hundredth year, or even beyond: come now, hold
         an audit of your life. Reckon how much of your time has been taken up by a money-lender, how much by a mistress, a
         patron, a client, quarrelling with your wife, punishing your slaves, dashing about the city on your social
         obligations. Consider also the diseases which we have brought on ourselves, and the time too which has been unused.
         You will find that you have fewer years than you reckon. Call to mind when you ever had a fixed purpose; how few days
         have passed as you had planned; when you were ever at your own disposal; when your face wore its natural expression;
         when your mind was undisturbed; what work you have achieved in such a long life; how many have plundered your life
         when you were unaware of your losses; how much you have lost through groundless sorrow, foolish joy, greedy desire,
         the seductions of society; how little of your own was left: to you. You will realize that you are dying prematurely.’
         <br>&emsp;So what is the reason for this? You are living as if destined to live for ever; your own frailty never
         occurs to you; you don’t notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and
         overflowing supply - though all the while that very day which you are devoting to somebody or something may be your
         last. You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire. You will hear many people
         saying: ‘When I am fifty I shall retire into leisure; when I am sixty I shall give up public duties.’ And what
         guarantee do you have of a longer life? Who will allow your course to proceed as you arrange it? Aren’t you ashamed
         to keep for yourself just the remnants of your life, and to devote to wisdom only that time which cannot be spent on
         any business? How late it is to begin really to live just when life must end! How stupid to forget our mortality, and
         put off sensible plans to our fiftieth and sixtieth years, aiming to begin life from a point at which few have
         arrived!
         <br>&emsp;You will notice that the most powerful and highly stationed men let drop remarks in which they pray for
         leisure, praise it, and rate it higher than all their blessings. At times they long to descend from their pinnacles
         if they can in safety; for even if nothing external assails or agitates it, high fortune of itself comes crashing
         down. The deified Augustus, to whom the gods granted more than to anyone else, never ceased to pray for rest and to
         seek a respite from public affairs. Everything he said always reverted to this theme - his hope for leisure. He used
         to beguile his labours with this consolation, sweet though false, that one day he would live to please himself. In a
         letter he wrote to the senate, after he promised that his rest would not be lacking in dignity nor inconsistent with
         his former glory, I find these words: ‘But it is more impressive to carry out these things than to promise them.
         Nevertheless, since the delightful reality is still a long way off, my longing for that much desired time has led me
         to anticipate some of its delight by the pleasure arising from words.’ So valuable did leisure seem to him that
         because he could not enjoy it in actuality, he did so mentally in advance. He who saw that everything depended on
         himself alone, who decided the fortune of individuals and nations, was happiest when thinking of that day on which he
         would lay aside his own greatness. He knew from experience how much sweat those blessings gleaming through every land
         cost him, how many secret anxieties they concealed. He was forced to fight first with his fellow-countrymen, then
         with his colleagues, and finally with his relations, shedding blood on land and sea. Driven to fight in Macedonia,
         Sicily, Egypt, Syria, Asia - almost every country - he turned his armies against foreign enemies when they were tired
         of shedding Roman blood. While he was establishing peace in the Alps and subduing enemies established in the middle
         of his peaceful empire; while he was extending his boundaries beyond the Rhine, the Euphrates and the Danube, at Rome
         itself Murena, Caepio, Lepidus, Egnatius and others were sharpening their swords against him. Nor had he yet escaped
         their plots when his daughter and all the noble youths bound to her by adultery as though by an oath kept alarming
         his feeble old age, as did Iullus and a second formidable woman linked to an Antony. He cut away these ulcers, limbs
         and all, but others took their place: just like a body with a surfeit of blood which is always subject to a
         haemorrhage somewhere. So he longed for leisure, and as his hopes and thoughts dwelt on that he found relief for his
         labours: this was the prayer of the man who could grant the prayers of mankind.
         <br>&emsp;When Marcus Cicero was cast among men like Catiline and Clodius and Pompey and Crassus - some of them
         undisguised enemies and some doubtful friends - when he was tossed about in the storm that struck the state, he tried
         to hold it steady as it went to its doom; but at last he was swept away. He had neither peace in prosperity nor
         patience in adversity, and how often does he curse that very consulship, which he had praised without ceasing though
         not without good reason! What woeful words he uses in a letter to Atticus when the elder Pompey had been conquered,
         and his son was still trying to revive his defeated forces in Spain! ‘Do you want to know,’ he said, ‘what I am doing
         here? I am staying a semi-prisoner in my Tusculan villa/ He then goes on to bewail his former life, to complain of
         the present, and to despair of the future. Cicero called himself a semi-prisoner, but really and truly the wise man
         will never go so far as to use such an abject term. He will never be a semi-prisoner, but will always enjoy freedom
         which is solid and complete, at liberty to be his own master and higher than all others. For what can be above the
         man who is above fortune?
         <br>&emsp;Livius Drusus, a bold and vigorous man, had proposed laws which renewed the evil policy of the Gracchi, and
         he was supported by a huge crowd from all over Italy. But he could see no successful outcome for his measures, which
         he could neither carry through nor abandon once embarked upon; and he is said to have cursed the turbulent life he
         had always lived, saying that he alone had never had a holiday even as a child. For while still a ward and dressed as
         a youth he ventured to speak to a jury in favour of some accused men, and to acquire influence in the law courts,
         with so much effect that, as we all know, he forced certain verdicts favourable to his clients. To what lengths would
         so precocious an ambition not go? You might have known that such premature boldness would result in terrible trouble,
         both public and private. So he was too late in complaining that he had never had a holiday, since from his boyhood he
         had been a serious trouble-maker in the Forum. It is uncertain whether he died by his own hand, for he collapsed
         after receiving a sudden wound in the groin, some people doubting whether his death was self-inflicted, but no one
         doubting that it was timely.
         <br>&emsp;It would be superfluous to mention any more who, though seeming to others the happiest of mortals,
         themselves bore true witness against themselves by their expressed hatred of every action of their lives. Yet they
         did not change themselves or anyone else by these com-plaints, for after their explosion of words their feelings
         reverted to normal.
         <br>&emsp;Assuredly your lives, even if they last more than a thousand years, will shrink into the tiniest span:
         those vices will swallow up any space of time. The actual time you have - which reason can prolong though it
         naturally passes quickly - inevitably escapes you rapidly: for you do not grasp it or hold it back or try to delay
         that swiftest of all things, but you let it slip away as though it were something superfluous and replaceable.
         <br>&emsp;But among the worst offenders I count those who spend all their time in drinking and lust, for these are
         the worst preoccupations of all. Other people, even if they are possessed by an illusory semblance of glory, suffer
         from a respectable delusion. You can give me a list of miserly men, or hot-tempered men who indulge in unjust hatreds
         or wars: but they are all sinning in a more manly way. It is those who are on a headlong course of gluttony and lust
         who are stained with dishonour. Examine how all these people spend their time - how long they devote to their
         accounts, to laying traps for others or fearing those laid for themselves, to paying court to others or being courted
         themselves, to giving or receiving bail, to banquets (which now count as official business): you will see how their
         activities, good or bad, do not give them even time to breathe.
         <br>&emsp;Finally, it is generally agreed that no activity can be successfully pursued by an individual who is
         preoccupied - not rhetoric or liberal studies - since the mind when distracted absorbs nothing deeply, but rejects
         everything which is, so to speak, crammed into it. Living is the least important activity of the preoccupied man; yet
         there is nothing which is harder to learn. There are many instructors in the other arts to be found everywhere:
         indeed, some of these arts mere boys have grasped so thoroughly that they can even teach them. But learning how to
         live takes a whole life, and, which may surprise you more, it takes a whole life to learn how to die. So many of the
         finest men have put aside all their encumbrances, renouncing riches and business and pleasure, and made it their one
         aim up to the end of their lives to know how to live. Yet most of these have died confessing that they did not yet
         know - still less can those others know. Believe me, it is the sign of a great man, and one who is above human error,
         not to allow his time to be frittered away: he has the longest possible life simply because whatever time was
         available he devoted entirely to himself. None of it lay fallow and neglected, none of it under another’s control;
         for being an extremely thrifty guardian of his time he never found anything for which it was worth exchanging. So he
         had enough time; but those into whose lives the public have made great inroads inevitably have too litde.
         <br>&emsp;Nor must you think that such people do not sometimes recognize their loss. Indeed, you will hear many of
         those to whom great prosperity is a burden sometimes crying out amidst their hordes of clients or their pleadings in
         law courts or their other honourable miseries. ‘It’s impossible to live.’ Of course it’s impossible. All those who
         call you to themselves draw you away from yourself. How many days has that defendant stolen from you? Or that
         candidate? Or that old lady worn out with burying her heirs? Or that man shamming an illness to excite the greed of
         legacy-hunters? Or that influential friend who keeps people like you not for friendship but for display? Mark off, I
         tell you, and review the days of your life: you will see that very few - the useless remnants - have been left to
         you. One man who has achieved the badge of office he coveted longs to lay it aside, and keeps repeating, ‘Will this
         year never end?’ Another man thought it a great coup to win the chance of giving games, but, having given them, he
         says, ‘When shall I be rid of them?’ That advocate is grabbed on every side throughout the Forum, and fills the whole
         place with a huge crowd extending further than he can be heard: but he says, ‘When will vacation come?’ Everyone
         hustles his life along, and is troubled by a longing for the future and weariness of the present. But the man who
         spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs for nor fears
         the next day. For what new pleasures can any hour now bring him? He has tried everything, and enjoyed everything to
         repletion. For the rest, Fortune can dispose as she likes: his life is now secure. Nothing can be taken from this
         life, and you can only add to it as if giving to a man who is already full and satisfied food which he does not want
         but can hold. So you must not think a man has lived long because he has white hair and wrinkles: he has not lived
         long, just existed long. For suppose you should think that a man had had a long voyage who had been caught in a
         raging storm as he left harbour, and carried hither and thither and driven round and round in a circle by the rage of
         opposing winds? He did not have a long voyage, just a long tossing about. I am always surprised to see some people
         demanding the time of others and meeting a most obliging response. Both sides have in view the reason for which the
         time is asked and neither regards the time itself - as if nothing there is being asked for and nothing given. They
         are trifling with life’s most precious commodity, being deceived because it is an intangible thing, not open to
         inspection and therefore reckoned very cheap - in fact, almost without any value. People are delighted to accept
         pensions and gratuities, for which they hire out their labour or their support or their services. But nobody works
         out the value of time: men use it lavishly as if it cost nothing. But if death threatens these same people, you will
         see them praying to their doctors; if they are in fear of capital punishment, you will see them prepared to spend
         their all to stay alive. So inconsistent are they in their feelings. But if each of us could have the tally of his
         future years set before him, as we can of our past years, how alarmed would be those who saw only a few years ahead,
         and how carefully would they use them! And yet it is easy to organize an amount, however small, which is assured; we
         have to be more careful in preserving what will cease at an unknown point.
         <br>&emsp;But you are not to think that these people do not know how precious time is. They commonly say to those
         they are particularly fond of that they are ready to give them some of their years. And they do give them without
         being aware of it; but the gift is such that they themselves lose without adding anything to the others. But what
         they actually do not know is whether they are losing; thus they can bear the loss of what they do not know has gone.
         No one will bring back the years; no one will restore you to yourself. Life will follow the path it began to take,
         and will neither reverse nor check its course. It will cause no commotion to remind you of its swiftness, but glide
         on quietly. It will not lengthen itself for a king’s command or a people’s favour. As it started out on its first
         day, so it will run on, nowhere pausing or turning aside. What will be the outcome? You have been preoccupied while
         life hastens on. Meanwhile death will arrive, and you have no choice in making yourself available for that.
         <br>&emsp;Can anything be more idiotic than certain people who boast of their foresight? They keep themselves
         officiously preoccupied in order to improve their lives; they spend their lives in organizing their lives. They
         direct their purposes with an eye to a distant future. But putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it
         snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. The greatest obstacle to
         living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today. You are arranging what lies in Fortune’s control,
         and abandoning what lies in yours. What are you looking at? To what goal are you straining? The whole future lies in
         uncertainty: live immediately. Listen to the cry of our greatest poet, who as though inspired with divine utterance
         sings salutary verses:
         <br>&emsp;Life’s finest day for wretched mortals here Is always first to flee. ‘Why do you linger?’ he means. ‘Why
         are you idle? If you don’t grasp it first, it flees.’ And even if you do grasp it, it will still flee. So you must
         match time’s swiftness with your speed in using it, and you must drink quickly as though from a rapid stream that
         will not always flow. In chastising endless delay, too, the poet very elegantly speaks not of the ‘finest age’ but
         ‘finest day’. However greedy you are, why are you so unconcerned and so sluggish (while time flies so fast),
         extending months and years in a long sequence ahead of you? The poet is telling you about the day - and about this
         very day that is escaping. So can it be doubted that for wretched mortals - that is, the preoccupied - the finest day
         is always the first to flee? Old age overtakes them while they are still mentally childish, and they face it
         unprepared and unarmed. For they have made no provision for it, stumbling upon it suddenly and unawares, and without
         realizing that it was approaching day by day. Just as travellers are beguiled by conversation or reading or some
         profound meditation, and find they have arrived at their destination before they knew they were approaching it; so it
         is with this unceasing and extremely fast-moving journey of life, which waking or sleeping we make at the same pace -
         the preoccupied become aware of it only when it is over.
         <br>&emsp;If I wanted to divide my theme into different headings and offer proofs, I would find many arguments to
         prove that the preoccupied find life very short. But Fabianus, who was not one of today’s academic philosophers but
         the true old-fashioned sort, used to say that we must attack the passions by brute force and not by logic; that the
         enemy’s line must be turned by a strong attack and not by pinpricks; for vices have to be crushed rather than picked
         at. Still, in order that the people concerned may be censured for their own individual faults, they must be taught
         and not just given up for lost.
         <br>&emsp;Life is divided into three periods, past, present and future. Of these, the present is short, the future is
         doubtful, the past is certain. For this last is the one over which Fortune has lost her power, which cannot be
         brought back to anyone’s control. But this is what preoccupied people lose: for they have no time to look back at
         their past, and even if they did, it is not pleasant to recall activities they are ashamed of. So they are unwilling
         to cast their minds back to times ill spent, which they dare not relive if their vices in recollection become obvious
         - even those vices whose insidious approach was disguised by the charm of some momentary pleasure. No one willingly
         reverts to the past unless all his actions have passed his own censorship, which is never deceived. The man who must
         fear his own memory is the one who has been ambitious in his greed, arrogant in his contempt, uncontrolled in his
         victories, treacherous in his deceptions, rapacious in his plundering, and wasteful in his squandering. And yet this
         is the period of our time which is sacred and dedicated, which has passed beyond all human risks and is removed from
         Fortune’s sway, which cannot be harassed by want or fear or attacks of illness. It cannot be disturbed or snatched
         from us: it is an untroubled, everlasting possession. In the present we have only one day at a time, each offering a
         minute at a time. But all the days of the past will come to your call: you can detain and inspect them at your will -
         something which the preoccupied have no time to do. It is the mind which is tranquil and free from care which can
         roam through all the stages of its life: the minds of the preoccupied, as if harnessed in a yoke, cannot turn round
         and look behind them. So their lives vanish into an abyss; and just as it is no use pouring any amount of liquid into
         a container without a bottom to catch and hold it, so it does not matter how much time we are given if there is
         nowhere for it to settle; it escapes through the cracks and holes of the mind. The present time is extremely short,
         so much so that some people are unaware of it. For it is always on the move, flowing on in a rush; it ceases before
         it has come, and does not suffer delay any more than the firmament or the stars, whose unceasing movement never
         pauses in the same place. And so the preoccupied are concerned only with the present, and it is so short that it
         cannot be grasped, and even this is stolen from them while they are involved in their many distractions.
         <br>&emsp;In a word, would you like to know how they do not live long? See how keen they are to live long. Feeble old
         men pray for a few more years; they pretend they are younger than they are; they comfort themselves by this deception
         and fool themselves as eagerly as if they fooled Fate at the same time. But when at last some illness has reminded
         them of their mortality, how terrified do they die, as if they were not just passing out of life but being dragged
         out of it. They exclaim that they were fools because they have not really lived, and that if only they can recover
         from this illness they will live in leisure. Then they reflect how pointlessly they acquired things they never would
         enjoy, and how all their toil has been in vain. But for those whose life is far removed from all business it must be
         amply long. None of it is frittered away, none of it scattered here and there, none of it committed to fortune, none
         of it lost through carelessness, none of it wasted on largesse, none of it superfluous: the whole of it, so to speak,
         is well invested. So, however short, it is fully sufficient, and therefore whenever his last day comes, the wise man
         will not hesitate to meet death with a firm step.
         <br>&emsp;Perhaps you want to know whom I would call the preoccupied? You must not imagine I mean just those who are
         driven from the law court only by the arrival of the watchdogs; or those whom you see crushed either honourably in
         their own crowd of supporters or contemptuously in someone else’s; or those whose social duties bring them forth from
         their own homes to dash them against someone else’s doors; or those whom the praetor’s auction spear occupies in
         acquiring disreputable gain which will one day turn rank upon them. Some men are preoccupied even in their leisure:
         in their country house, on their couch, in the midst of solitude, even when quite alone, they are their own worst
         company. You could not call theirs a life of leisure, but an idle preoccupation. Do you call that man leisured who
         arranges with anxious precision his Corinthian bronzes, the cost of which is inflated by the mania of a few
         collectors, and spends most of the day on rusty bits of metal? Who sits at a wrestling ring (for shame on us! We
         suffer from vices which are not even Roman), keenly following the bouts between boys? Who classifies his herds of
         pack-animals into pairs according to age and colour? Who pays for the maintenance of the latest athletes? Again, do
         you call those men leisured who spend many hours at the barber s simply to cut whatever grew overnight, to have a
         serious debate about every separate hair, to tidy up disarranged locks or to train thinning ones from the sides to
         lie over the forehead? How angry they get if the barber has been a bit careless - as if he were trimming a real man!
         How they flare up if any of their mane is wrongly cut off, if any of it is badly arranged, or if it doesn’t all fall
         into the right ringlets! Which of them would not rather have his country ruffled than his hair? Which would not be
         more anxious about the elegance of his head than its safety? Which would not rather be trim than honourable? Do you
         call those men leisured who divide their time between the comb and the mirror? And what about those who busy
         themselves in composing, listening to, or learning songs, while they distort their voice, whose best and simplest
         tone nature intended to be the straight one, into the most unnatural modulations; who are always drumming with their
         fingers as they beat time to an imagined tune; whom you can hear humming to themselves even when they are summoned on
         a serious, often even sorrowful, affair? Theirs is not leisure but indolent occupation. And, good heavens, as for
         their banquets, I would not reckon on them as leisure times when I see how anxiously they arrange their silver, how
         carefully they gird up the tunics of their page-boys, how on tenterhooks they are to see how the cook has dealt with
         the boar, with what speed smooth-faced slaves rush around on their duties, with what skill birds are carved into
         appropriate portions, how carefully wretched little slaves wipe up the spittle of drunkards. By these means they
         cultivate a reputation for elegance and good taste, and to such an extent do their failings follow them into all
         areas of their private lives that they cannot eat or drink without ostentation.
         <br>&emsp;I would also not count as leisured those who are carried around in a sedan chair and a litter, and turn up
         punctually for their drives as if it was forbidden to give them up; who have to be told when to bathe or to swim or
         to dine: they are so enervated by the excessive torpor of a self-indulgent mind that they cannot trust themselves to
         know if they are hungry. I am told that one of these self-indulgent people - if self-indulgence is the right word for
         unlearning the ordinary habits of human life - when he had been carried out from the bath and put in his sedan chair,
         asked, ‘Am I now sitting down?’ Do you think that this man, who doesn’t know if he is sitting down, knows whether he
         is alive, whether he sees, whether he is at leisure? It is difficult to say whether I pity him more if he really did
         not know this or if he pretended not to know. They really experience forgetfulness of many things, but they also
         pretend to forget many things. They take delight in certain vices as proofs of their good fortune: it seems to be the
         lowly and contemptible man who knows what he is doing. After that see if you can accuse the mimes of inventing many
         details in order to attack luxury! In truth, they pass over more than they make up, and such a wealth of incredible
         vices have appeared in this generation, which shows talent in this one area, that we could now actually accuse the
         mimes of ignoring them. To think that there is anyone so lost in luxuries that he has to trust another to tell him if
         he is sitting down! So this one is not at leisure, and you must give him another description - he is ill, or even, he
         is dead: the man who is really at leisure is also aware of it. But this one who is only half alive, and needs to be
         told the positions of his own body - how can he have control over any of his time?
         <br>&emsp;It would be tedious to mention individually those who have spent all their lives playing draughts or ball,
         or carefully cooking themselves in the sun. They are not at leisure whose pleasures involve a serious commitment. For
         example, nobody will dispute that those people are busy about nothing who spend their time on useless literary
         studies: even among the Romans there is now a large company of these. It used to be a Greek failing to want to know
         how many oarsmen Ulysses had, whether the Iliad or the Odyssey was written first, and whether too they were by the
         same author, and other questions of this kind, which if you keep them to yourself in no way enhance your private
         knowledge, and if you publish them make you appear more a bore than a scholar. But now the Romans too have been
         afflicted by the pointless enthusiasm for useless knowledge. Recently I heard somebody reporting which Roman general
         first did this or that: Duilius first won a naval battle; Curius Dentatus first included elephants in a triumph. So
         far these facts, even if they do not contribute to real glory, at least are concerned with exemplary services to the
         state: such knowledge will not do us any good, but it interests us because of the appeal of these pointless facts. We
         can also excuse those who investigate who first persuaded the Romans to embark on a ship. That was Claudius, who for
         this reason was called Caudex because a structure linking several wooden planks was called in antiquity a caudex.
         Hence too the Law Tables are called codices, and even today the boats which carry provisions up the Tiber are called
         by the old-fashioned name codicariae. Doubtless too it is of some importance to know that Valerius Corvinus first
         conquered Messana, and was the first of the family of the Valerii to be sumamed Messana from the name of the captured
         city - the spelling of which was gradually corrupted in everyday speech to Messalla. Perhaps you will also allow
         someone to take seriously the fact that Lucius Sulla first exhibited lions loose in the Circus, though at other times
         they were shown in fetters, and that javelin-throwers were sent by King Bocchus to kill them. This too may be excused
         - but does it serve any good purpose? - to know that Pompey first exhibited in the Circus a fight involving eighteen
         elephants, pitting innocent men against them in a staged battle. A leader of the state and, as we are told, a man of
         notable kindliness among the leaders of old, he thought it would be a memorable spectacle to kill human beings in a
         novel way. ‘Are they to fight to the death? Not good enough. Are they to be torn to pieces? Not good enough. Let them
         be crushed by animals of enormous bulk.’ It would be better for such things to be forgotten, lest in the future
         someone in power might learn about them and not wish to be outdone in such a piece of inhumanity. Oh, what darkness
         does great prosperity cast over our minds! He thought himself beyond nature’s laws at the time that he was throwing
         so many crowds of wretched men to wild creatures from abroad, when he was setting such disparate creatures against
         each other, when he was shedding so much blood in front of the Roman people, who themselves were soon to be forced by
         him to shed their own blood. But later he himself, betrayed by Alexandrian treachery, offered himself to be stabbed
         by the lowest slave, only then realizing that his surname (‘Great’) was an empty boast.
         <br>&emsp;But to return to the point from which I digressed, and to illustrate how some people spend useless efforts
         on these same topics, the man I referred to reported that Metellus in his triumph, after conquering the Carthaginians
         in Sicily, alone among all the Romans had 20 elephants led before his chariot, and that Sulla was the last of the
         Romans to have extended the pomerium* which it was the ancient practice to extend after acquiring Italian, but never
         provincial, territory. Is it better to know this than to know that the Aventine Hill, as he asserted, is outside the
         pomerium for one of two reasons, either because the plebs withdrew to it or because when Remus took the auspices
         there the birds had not been favourable - and countless further theories that are either false or very close to lies?
         For even if you admit that they say all this in good faith, even if they guarantee the truth of their statements,
         whose mistakes will thereby be lessened? Whose passions restrained? Who will be made more free, more just, more
         magnanimous? Our Fabianus used to say that sometimes he wondered whether it was better not to be involved in any
         researches than to get entangled in these.
         <br>&emsp;Of all people only those are at leisure who make time for philosophy, only those are really alive. For they
         not only keep a good watch over their own lifetimes, but they annex every age to theirs. All the years that have
         passed before them are added to their own. Unless we are very ungrateful, all those distinguished founders of holy
         creeds were born for us and prepared for us a way of life. By the toil of others we are led into the presence of
         things which have been brought from darkness into light. We are excluded from no age, but we have access to them all;
         and if we are prepared in loftiness of mind to pass beyond the narrow confines of human weakness, there is a long
         period of time through which we can roam. We can argue with Socrates, express doubt with Carneades, cultivate
         retirement with Epicurus, overcome human nature with the Stoics, and exceed its limits with the Cynics. Since nature
         allows us to enter into a partnership with every age, why not turn from this brief and transient spell of time and
         give ourselves wholeheartedly to the past, which is limitless and eternal and can be shared with better men than we?
         <br>&emsp;Those who rush about on social duties, disturbing both themselves and others, when they have duly finished
         their crazy round and have daily crossed everyone’s threshold and passed by no open door, when they have carried
         around their self-interested greetings to houses that are miles apart, how few will they be able to see in a city so
         enormous and so distracted by varied desires? How many will there be who through sleepiness or self-indulgence or
         ungraciousness will exclude them? How many, after keeping them in an agony of waiting, will pretend to be in a hurry
         and rush past them? How many will avoid going out through a hall crowded with dependants, and escape through a secret
         door - as if it were not even more discourteous to deceive callers than to exclude them? How many, half asleep and
         sluggish after yesterday’s drinking, will yawn insolently and have to be prompted a thousand times in a whisper
         before, scarcely moving their lips, they can greet by name the poor wretches who have broken their own slumbers in
         order to wait on another’s?
         <br>&emsp;You should rather suppose that those are involved in worthwhile duties who wish to have daily as their
         closest friends Zeno, Pythagoras, Democritus and all the other high priests of liberal studies, and Aristotle and
         Theophrastus. None of these will be too busy to see you, none of these will not send his visitor away happier and
         more devoted to himself, none of these will allow anyone to depart empty-handed. They are at home to all mortals by
         night and by day.
         <br>&emsp;None of these will force you to die, but all will teach you how to die. None of them will exhaust your
         years, but each will contribute his years to yours. With none of these will conversation be dangerous, or his
         friendship fatal, or attendance on him expensive. From them you can take whatever you wish: it will not be their
         fault if you do not take your fill from them. What happiness, what a fine old age awaits the man who has made himself
         a client of these! He will have friends whose advice he can ask on the most important or the most trivial matters,
         whom he can consult daily about himself, who will tell him the truth without insulting him and praise him without
         flattery, who will offer him a pattern on which to model himself.
         <br>&emsp;We are in the habit of saying that it was not in our power to choose the parents who were allotted to us,
         that they were given to us by chance. But we can choose whose children we would like to be. There are households of
         the noblest intellects: choose the one into which you wish to be adopted, and you will inherit not only their name
         but their property too. Nor will this property need to be guarded meanly or grudgingly: the more it is shared out,
         the greater it will become. These will offer you a path to immortality and raise you to a point from which no one is
         cast down. This is the only way to prolong mortality - even to convert it to immortality. Honours, monuments,
         whatever the ambitious have ordered by decrees or raised in public buildings are soon destroyed: there is nothing
         that the passage of time does not demolish and remove. But it cannot damage the works which philosophy has
         consecrated: no age will wipe them out, no age diminish them. The next and every following age will only increase the
         veneration for them, since envy operates on what is at hand, but we can more openly admire things from a distance. So
         the life of the philosopher extends widely: he is not confined by the same boundary as are others. He alone is free
         from the laws that limit the human race, and all ages serve him as though he were a god. Some time has passed: he
         grasps it in his recollection. Time is present: he uses it. Time is to come: he anticipates it. This combination of
         all times into one gives him a long life.
         <br>&emsp;But life is very short and anxious for those who forget the past, neglect the present, and fear the future.
         When they come to the end of it, the poor wretches realize too late that for all this time they have been preoccupied
         in doing nothing. And the fact that they sometimes invoke death is no proof that their lives seem long. Their own
         folly afflicts them with restless emotions which hurl themselves upon the very things they fear: they often long for
         death because they fear it. Nor is this a proof that they are living for a long time that the day often seems long to
         them, or that they complain that the hours pass slowly until the time fixed for dinner arrives. For as soon as their
         preoccupations fail them, they are restless with nothing to do, not knowing how to dispose of their leisure or make
         the time pass. And so they are anxious for something else to do, and all the intervening time is wearisome: really,
         it is just as when a gladiatorial show has been announced, or they are looking forward to the appointed time of some
         other exhibition or amusement - they want to leap over the days in between. Any deferment of the longed-for event is
         tedious to them. Yet the time of the actual enjoyment is short and swift, and made much shorter through their own
         fault. For they dash from one pleasure to another and cannot stay steady in one desire. Their days are not long but
         odious: on the other hand, how short do the nights seem which they spend drinking or sleeping with harlots! Hence the
         lunacy of the poets, who encourage human frailty by their stories in which Jupiter, seduced by the pleasures of
         love-making, is seen to double the length of the night. What else is it but to inflame our vices when they quote the
         gods to endorse them, and as a precedent for our failings they offer - and excuse - the wantonness of the gods? Can
         the nights, which they purchase so dearly, not seem much too short to these people? They lose the day in waiting for
         the night, and the night in fearing the dawn.
         <br>&emsp;Even their pleasures are uneasy and made anxious by various fears, and at the very height of their
         rejoicing the worrying thought steals over them: ‘How long will this last?’ This feeling has caused kings to bewail
         their power, and they were not so much delighted by the greatness of their fortune as terrified by the thought of its
         inevitable end. When that most arrogant king of Persia* was deploying his army over vast plains, and could not number
         it but had to measure it, he wept because in a hundred years out of that huge army not a soul would be alive. But he
         who was weeping was the very man who would bring their fate upon them, and would destroy some on the sea, some on
         land, some in battle, some in flight, and in a very short time would wipe out all those for whose hundredth year he
         was afraid.
         <br>&emsp;And what of the fact that even their joys are uneasy? The reason is that they are not based on firm causes,
         but they are agitated as groundlessly as they arise. But what kind of times can those be, do you think, which they
         themselves admit are wretched, since even the joys by which they are exalted and raised above humanity are pretty
         corrupt? All the greatest blessings create anxiety, and Fortune is never less to be trusted than when it is fairest.
         To preserve prosperity we need other prosperity, and to support the prayers which have turned out well we have to
         make other prayers. Whatever comes our way by chance is unsteady, and the higher it rises the more liable it is to
         fall. Furthermore, what is doomed to fall delights no one. So it is inevitable that life will be not just very short
         but very miserable for those who acquire by great toil what they must keep by greater toil. They achieve what they
         want laboriously; they possess what they have achieved anxiously; and meanwhile they take no account of time that
         will never more return. New preoccupations take the place of the old, hope excites more hope and ambition more
         ambition. They do not look for an end to their misery, but simply change the reason for it. We have found our own
         public honours a torment, and we spend more time on someone else’s. We have stopped labouring as candidates, and we
         start canvassing for others. We have given up the troubles of a prosecutor, and taken on those of a judge. A man
         stops being a judge and becomes president of a court. He has grown old in the job of managing the property of others
         for a salary, and then spends all his time looking after his own. Marius was released from army life to become busy
         in the consulship. Quintius hastens to get through his dictatorship, but he will be summoned back to it from the
         plough. Scipio will go against the Carthaginians before he is experienced enough for such an undertaking. Victorious
         over Hannibal, victorious over Antiochus, distinguished in his own consulship and a surety for his brother’s, if he
         had not himself forbidden it he would have been set up beside Jupiter. But discord in the state will harass its
         saviour, and after as a young man he has scorned honours fit for the gods, at length when old he will take delight in
         an ostentatiously stubborn exile. There will always be causes for anxiety, whether due to prosperity or to
         wretchedness. Life will be driven on through a succession of preoccupations: we shall always long for leisure, but
         never enjoy it.
         <br>&emsp;And so, my dear Paulinus, extract yourself from the crowd, and as you have been storm-tossed more than your
         age deserves, you must at last retire into a peaceful harbour. Consider how many waves you have encountered, how many
         storms - some of which you have sustained in private life and some you have brought upon yourself in public life.
         Your virtue has for long enough been shown, when you were a model of active industry: try how it will manage in
         leisure. The greater part of your life, certainly the better part, has been devoted to the state: take some of your
         own time for yourself too. I am not inviting you to idle or purposeless sloth, or to drown all your natural energy in
         sleep and the pleasures that are dear to the masses. That is not to have repose. When you are retired and enjoying
         peace of ipiind, you will find to keep you busy more important activities than all those you have performed so
         energetically up to now. Indeed, you are managing the accounts of the world as scrupulously as you would another
         person’s, as carefully as your own, as conscientiously as the state’s. You are winning affection in a job in which it
         is hard to avoid ill-will; but believe me it is better to understand the balance-sheet of one’s own life than of the
         corn trade. You must recall that vigorous mind of yours, supremely capable of dealing with the greatest
         responsibilities, from a task which is certainly honourable but scarcely suited to the happy life; and you must
         consider that all your youthful training in the liberal studies was not directed to this end, that many thousands of
         measures of corn might safely be entrusted to you. You had promised higher and greater things of yourself. There will
         not be wanting men who are completely worthy and hard-working. Stolid pack-animals are much more fit for carrying
         loads than thoroughbred horses: who ever subdued their noble speed with a heavy burden? Consider too how much anxiety
         you have in submitting yourself to such a weight of responsibility: you are dealing with the human belly. A hungry
         people neither listens to reason nor is mollified by fair treatment or swayed by any appeals. Quite recently, within
         a few days after Gaius Caesar died - still feeling very upset (if the dead have feelings) because he saw that the
         Roman people were still surviving, with a supply of food for seven or at most eight days, while he was building
         bridges with boats and playing with the resources of the empire - we faced the worst of all afflictions, even to
         those under siege, a shortage of provisions. His imitation of a mad foreign king doomed in his pride, nearly cost the
         city destruction and famine and the universal collapse that follows famine. What then must those have felt who had
         charge of the corn supply, when they were threatened with stones, weapons, fire - and Gaius? With a huge pretence
         they managed to conceal the great evil lurking in the vitals of the state - and assuredly they had good reason. For
         certain ailments must be treated while the patient is unaware of them: knowing about their disease has caused the
         death of many.
         <br>&emsp;You must retire to these pursuits which are quieter, safer and more important. Do you think it is the same
         thing whether you are overseeing the transfer of corn into granaries, unspoilt by the dishonesty and carelessness of
         the shippers, and taking care that it does not get damp and then ruined through heat, and that it tallies in measure
         and weight; or whether you take up these sacred and lofty studies, from which you will learn the substance of god,
         and his will, his mode of life, his shape; what fate awaits your soul; where nature lays us to rest when released
         from our bodies; what is the force which supports all the heaviest elements of this world at the centre, suspends the
         light elements above, carries fire to the highest part, and sets the stars in motion with their proper changes - and
         learn other things in succession which are full of tremendous marvels? You really should leave the ground and turn
         your thoughts to these studies. Now while the blood is hot you should make your way with vigour to better things. In
         this kind of life you will find much that is worth your study: the love and practice of the virtues, forgetfulness of
         the passions, the knowledge of how to live and die, and a life of deep tranquillity.
         <br>&emsp;Indeed the state of all who are preoccupied is wretched, but the most wretched are those who are toiling
         not even at their own preoccupations, but must regulate their sleep by another’s, and their walk by another’s pace,
         and obey orders in those freest of all things, loving and hating. If such people want to know how short their lives
         are, let them reflect how small a portion is their own.
         <br>&emsp;So, when you see a man repeatedly wearing the robe of office, or one whose name is often spoken in the
         Forum, do not envy him: these things are won at the cost of life. In order that one year may be dated from their
         names they will waste all their own years. Life has left some men struggling at the start of their careers before
         they could force their way to the height of their ambition. Some men, after they have crawled through a thousand
         indignities to the supreme dignity, have been assailed by the gloomy thought that all their labours were but for the
         sake of an epitaph. Some try to adjust their extreme old age to new hopes as though it were youth, but find its
         weakness fails them in the midst of efforts that overtax it. It is a shameful sight when an elderly man runs out of
         breath while he is pleading in court for litigants who are total strangers to him, and trying to win the applause of
         the ignorant bystanders. It is disgraceful to see a man collapsing in the middle of his duties, worn out more by his
         life-style than by his labours. Disgraceful too is it when a man dies in the midst of going through his accounts, and
         his heir, long kept waiting, smiles in relief. I cannot resist telling you of an instance that occurs to me. Sextus
         Turannius was an old man known to be scrupulous and diligent, who, when he was ninety, at his own request was given
         retirement from his office by Gaius Caesar. He then ordered himself to be laid out on his bed and lamented by the
         assembled household as though he were dead. The house bewailed its old master’s leisure, and did not cease its
         mourning until his former job was restored to him. Is it really so pleasant to die in harness? That is the feeling of
         many people: their desire for their work outlasts their ability to do it. They fight against their own bodily
         weakness, and they regard old age as a hardship on no other grounds than that it puts them on the shelf. The law does
         not make a man a soldier after fifty or a senator after sixty: men find it more difficult to gain leisure from
         themselves than from the law. Meanwhile, as they rob and are robbed, as they disturb each other’s peace, as they make
         each other miserable, their lives pass without satisfaction, without pleasure, without mental improvement. No one
         keeps death in view, no one refrains from hopes that look far ahead; indeed, some people even arrange things that are
         beyond life - massive tombs, dedications of public buildings, shows for their funerals, and ostentatious burials. But
         in truth, such people’s funerals should be conducted with torches and wax tapers, as though they had lived the
         shortest of lives.

      <div class="content-text hidden" id="ConsolationHelvia">
         Dearest mother, I have often had the urge to console you and often restrained it. Many things encouraged me to
         venture to do so. First, I thought I would be laying aside all my troubles when I had at least wiped away your tears,
         even if I could not stop them coming. Then, I did not doubt that I would have more power to raise you up if I had
         first risen myself. Moreover, I was afraid that though Fortune was conquered by me she might conquer someone close to
         me. So, staunching my own cut with my hand I was doing my best to crawl forward to bind up your wounds. There were,
         on the other hand, considerations which delayed my purpose. I realized that your grief should not be intruded upon
         while it was fresh and agonizing, in case the consolations themselves should rouse and inflame it: for an illness too
         nothing is more harmful than premature treatment. So I was waiting until your grief of itself should lose its force
         and, being softened by time to endure remedies, it would allow itself to be touched and handled. Moreover, although I
         consulted all the works written by the most famous authors to control and moderate grief, I couldn’t find any example
         of someone who had comforted his own dear ones when he himself was the subject of their grief. So in this
         unprecedented situation I hesitated, fearing that I would be offering not consolation but further irritation.
         Consider, too, that a man lifting his head from the very funeral pyre must need some novel vocabulary not drawn from
         ordinary everyday condolence to comfort his own dear ones. But every great and overpowering grief must take away the
         capacity to choose words, since it often stifles the voice itself. Anyway, I’ll try my best, not trusting in my
         cleverness, but because being myself the comforter I can thereby be the most effective comfort. As you never refused
         me anything hope you will not refuse me this at least (though all grief is stubborn), to be willing that I should set
         a limit to your desolation.
         <br>&emsp;Consider how much I have promised myself from your indulgence. I don’t doubt that I shall have more
         influence over you than your grief, than which nothing has more influence over the wretched. So in order not to join
         battle with it at once, I’ll first support it and offer it a lot of encouragement: I shall expose and reopen all the
         wounds which have already healed. Someone will object: ‘What kind of consolation is this, to bring back forgotten
         ills and to set the mind in view of all its sorrows when it can scarcely endure one?’ But let him consider that those
         disorders which are so dangerous that they have gained ground in spite of treatment can generally be treated by
         opposite methods. Therefore I shall offer to the mind all its sorrows, all its mourning garments: this will not be a
         gentle prescription for healing, but cautery and the knife. What shall I achieve? That a soul which has conquered so
         many miseries will be ashamed to worry about one more wound in a body which already has so many scars. So let those
         people go on weeping and wailing whose self-indulgent minds have been weakened by long prosperity, let them collapse
         at the threat of the most trivial injuries; but let those who have spent all their years suffering disasters endure
         the worst afflictions with a brave and resolute staunchness. Everlasting misfortune does have one blessing, that it
         ends up by toughening those whom it constantly afflicts.
         <br>&emsp;Fortune has given you no respite from the most woeful sorrows, not even excepting the day of your birth. As
         soon as you were born, no, even while being born, you lost your mother, and on the threshold of life you were in a
         sense exposed. You grew up under the care of a stepmother, and you actually forced her to become a real mother by
         showing her all the deference and devotion which can be seen even in a daughter. Yet even having a good stepmother
         costs every child a good deal. You lost your uncle, kindest, best and bravest of men, when you were awaiting his
         arrival; and lest Fortune should lessen her cruelty by dividing it, within a month you buried your dearest husband by
         whom you had three children. This sorrow was announced to you when you were already grieving, and when indeed all
         your children were away, as if your misfortunes were concentrated on purpose into that time so that your grief would
         have nowhere to turn for relief. I pass over all the dangers, all the fears you endured as they assailed you
         unceasingly. But recently into the same lap from which you had let go three grandchildren you received back the bones
         of three grandchildren. Within twenty days of burying my son, who died as you held and kissed him, you heard that I
         had been taken away. This only you had lacked - to grieve for the living.
         <br>&emsp;Of all the wounds which have ever pierced your body this last one is, I admit, the worst. It has not simply
         broken the skin but cut into your breast and vital parts. But just as recruits, even when superficially wounded, cry
         aloud and dread being handled by doctors more than the sword, while veterans, even if severely wounded, patiently and
         without a groan allow their wounds to be cleaned as though their bodies did not belong to them; so you must now offer
         yourself bravely for treatment. Come, put away wailings and lamentations and all the other usual noisy manifestations
         of feminine grief. For all your sorrows have been wasted on you if you have not yet learned how to be wretched. Do I
         seem to have dealt boldly with you? I have kept away not one of your misfortunes from you, but piled them all up in
         front of you.
         <br>&emsp;I have done this courageously for I decided to conquer your grief, not to cheat it. But I shall do this, I
         think, first of all if I show that I am suffering nothing for which I could be called wretched, let alone make my
         relations wretched; then if I turn to you and show that your fortune, which is wholly dependent on mine, is also not
         painful.
         <br>&emsp;First I shall deal with the fact, which your love is longing to hear, that I am suffering no affliction. I
         shall make it clear, if I can, that those very circumstances which you think are crushing me can be borne; but if you
         cannot believe that, at least I shall be more pleased with myself for being happy in conditions which nor-mally make
         men wretched. There is no need to believe others about me: I am telling you firmly that I am not wretched, so that
         you won’t be agitated by uncertainty. To reassure you further, I shall add that I cannot even be made wretched.
         <br>&emsp;We are born under circumstances that would be favourable if we did not abandon them. It was nature’s
         intention that there should be no need of great equipment for a good life: every individual can make himself happy.
         External goods are of trivial importance and without much influence in either direction: prosperity does not elevate
         the sage and adversity does not depress him. For he has always made the effort to rely as much as possible on himself
         and to derive all delight from himself. So what? Am I calling myself a sage? Certainly not. For if I could claim
         that, not only would I be denying that I was wretched but I would be asserting that I was the most fortunate of all
         men and coming close to god. As it is, doing what is sufficient to alleviate all wretchedness, I have surrendered
         myself to wise men, and as I am not yet strong enough to help myself I have gone over to another camp - I mean those
         who can easily protect themselves and their followers. They have ordered me to take a firm stand, like a sentry on
         guard, and to foresee all the attacks and all the onslaughts of Fortune long before they hit me. She falls heavily on
         those to whom she is unexpected; the man who is always expecting her easily withstands her. For an enemy’s arrival
         too scatters those whom it catches off guard; but those who have prepared in advance for the coming conflict, being
         properly drawn up and equipped, easily withstand the first onslaught, which is the most violent. Never have I trusted
         Fortune, even when she seemed to offer peace. All those blessings which she kindly bestowed on me - money, public
         office, influence - I relegated to a place whence she could claim them back without bothering me. I kept a wide gap
         between them and me, with the result that she has taken them away, not torn them away. No man has been shattered by
         the blows of Fortune unless he was first deceived by her favours. Those who loved her gifts as if they were their own
         for ever, who wanted to be admired on account of them, are laid low and grieve when the false and transient pleasures
         desert their vain and childish minds, ignorant of every stable pleasure. But the man who is not puffed up in good
         times does not collapse either when they change. His fortitude is already tested and he maintains a mind unconquered
         in the face of either condition: for in the midst of prosperity he has tried his own strength against adversity. So I
         have never believed that there was any genuine good in the things which everyone prays for; what is more, I have
         found them empty and daubed with showy and deceptive colours, with nothing inside to match their appearance. And now
         in these so-called evils I find nothing so terrible and harsh as the general opinion threatened. Certainly the word
         ‘exile’ itself now enters the ears more harshly through a sort of conviction and popular belief, and strikes the
         listener as something gloomy and detestable. For that is the people’s verdict, but wise men on the whole reject the
         people’s decrees.
         <br>&emsp;So, putting aside this judgement of the majority who are carried away by the surface appearance of things,
         whatever the grounds for believing in it, let us examine the reality of exile. Clearly a change of place. I must not
         seem to restrict its force and remove its worst feature, so I agree that this change of place brings with it the
         disadvantages of poverty, disgrace and contempt. I shall deal with these later; meanwhile I wish first to examine
         what distress the change of place itself involves.
         <br>&emsp;‘It is unbearable to be deprived of your country.’ Come now, look at this mass of people whom the buildings
         of huge Rome can scarcely hold: most of that crowd are deprived of their country. They have flocked together from
         their towns and colonies, in fact from the whole world, some brought by ambition, some by the obligation of public
         office, some by the duties of an envoy, some by self-indulgence seeking a place conveniendy rich in vice, some by a
         love of liberal studies, some by the public shows; some have been attracted by friendship, some by their own energy
         which has found a wide field for displaying its qualities; some have come to sell their beauty, others their
         eloquence. Absolutely every type of person has hastened into the city which offers high rewards for both virtues and
         vices. Take a roll-call of all of them and ask each where he comes from: you will see that most of them have left
         their own homes and come to a very great and beautiful city, but not their own. Then move away from this city, which
         in a way can be said to belong to all, and go around all the others: in every one a large proportion of the
         population is immigrant. Pass on from those whose lovely and convenient position attracts large numbers, and review
         deserted places and rocky islands, Sciathus and Seriphus, Gyara and Cossura: you will find no place of exile where
         somebody does not linger because he wants to. What could be found so bare and with such a steep drop on every side as
         this rock? What more barren regarding its resources? What more savage regarding its people? What more rugged
         regarding its geography? What more intemperate regarding its climate? Yet more foreigners than natives live here.
         Thus, so far is change of locality itself from being a hardship that even this place has enticed some people from
         their homeland. I’ve come across people who say that there is a sort of inborn restlessness in the human spirit and
         an urge to change one’s abode; for man is endowed with a mind which is changeable and unsettled: nowhere at rest, it
         darts about and directs its thoughts to all places known and unknown, a wanderer which cannot endure repose and
         delights chiefly in novelty. This will not surprise you if you consider its original source. It was not made from
         heavy, earthly material, but came down from that heavenly spirit: but heavenly things are by nature always in motion,
         fleeing and driven on extremely fast. Look at the planets which light up the world: not one is at rest. The sun
         glides constantly, moving on from place to place, and although it revolves with the universe its motion is
         nevertheless opposite to that of the firmament itself: it races through all the signs of the zodiac and never stops;
         its motion is everlasting as it journeys from one point to another. All the planets forever move round and pass by:
         as the constraining law of nature has ordained they are borne from point of point. When through fixed periods of
         years they have completed their courses they will start again upon their former circuits. How silly then to imagine
         that the human mind, which is formed of the same elements as divine beings, objects to movement and change of abode,
         while the divine nature finds delight and even self-preservation in continual and very rapid change.
         <br>&emsp;Well, now, turn your attention from heavenly to human matters and you will see that whole nations and
         peoples have changed their abode. What are Greek cities doing in the midst of barbarian territories? Why do we hear
         the Macedonian language among Indians and Persians? Scythia and all that wide region of fierce and untamed tribes
         reveal Achaean cities established on the shores of the Pontus. People were not put off from migrating there by the
         endlessly severe winter or the savage character of the natives which matched their climate. There is a crowd of
         Athenians in Asia; Miletus has sent out all over the place enough people to colonize seventy-five cities; the whole
         of the Italian coast which is washed by the lower sea was once Greater Greece. Asia claims the Etruscans as her own;
         Tyrians live in Africa, Phoenicians in Spain; Greeks penetrated into Gaul and Gauls into Greece; the Pyrenees did not
         block the passage of the Germans - through trackless, through unknown territory has ventured the restlessness of men,
         and behind them came their wives and children and parents stricken in years. Some of them, driven about in their long
         wanderings, did not choose their goal deliberately, but through weariness settled at the nearest place; others by
         force of arms established their right in a foreign country. Some tribes were drowned while they sought unknown
         regions; others settled where they were stranded by running out of supplies. They did not all have the same reason
         for abandoning one homeland for another. Some, escaping the destruction of their cities by enemy attack, were driven
         to other territory when they lost their own; some were banished by civil strife; others were sent out to relieve the
         burden of overpopulation; others fled from disease or constant earthquakes or some intolerable deficiencies in their
         barren soil; others were tempted by the exaggerated report of a fertile shore. Different reasons roused different
         peoples to leave their homes; but this at least is clear, nothing has stayed where it was born. The human race is
         always on the move: in so large a world there is every day some change - new cities are founded, and new names of
         nations are born as former ones disappear or are absorbed into a stronger one. But what else are all these national
         migrations than banishments of a people? Why should I drag you through the whole cycle? Why bother to mention Antenor
         who founded Patavium, and Evander who settled the Arcadian kingdom on the banks of the Tiber? What about Diomedes and
         the others, both conquerors and conquered, who were scattered over alien lands by the Trojan War? Why, the Roman
         empire itself looks back to an exile as its founder, a man who was driven out when his homeland was captured and,
         taking a few survivors, was forced by fear of the victor to make a long journey which brought him to Italy. What a
         number of colonies this people in turn has sent out to every province! -wherever the Romans have conquered they
         dwell. People volunteered for this kind of emigration, and even old men leaving their altars followed the settlers
         overseas. The point does not need any more illustration, but I will just add one which hits you in the eye: this
         island itself has often changed its inhabitants. To leave aside earlier events which are obscured by antiquity, the
         Greeks who now live in Massilia after leaving Phocis first settled in this island. It is not clear what drove them
         from it, whether the harsh climate, or being in sight of the superior power of Italy, or the lack of harbours. For
         clearly the reason was not the savagery of the inhabitants, since they settled among what were then the fiercest and
         most uncivilized peoples in Gaul. Subsequently the Ligurians crossed over to the island, and the Spaniards too, as is
         clear from the similarity of their customs: for the Corsicans wear the same kind of head-covering and shoes as the
         Cantabrians, and some of their words are the same - only some, for their language as a whole, through association
         with Greeks and Ligurians, has lost its native elements. Next, two colonies of Roman citizens were brought there, one
         by Marius and one by Sulla: so often has the population of this barren and thorny rock changed! In a word, you will
         hardly find a single country still inhabited by its original natives: everywhere the people are of mixed and imported
         stock. One group has followed another: one longed for what another scorned; one was driven out from where he had
         expelled others. So fate has decreed that nothing maintains the same condition forever.
         <br>&emsp;To compensate for the actual change of place and forgetting about the other inconveniences attached to
         exile, Varro, most learned of Romans, considers we have this sufficient remedy, that wherever we come we have the
         same order of nature to deal with. Marcus Brutus thinks this is enough, that exiles can carry with them their own
         virtues. Even if anyone thinks that these points taken separately are insufficient to console the exile, he will
         admit that in combination they carry great weight. For how little have we lost, when the two finest things of all
         will accompany us wherever we go, universal nature and our individual virtue. Believe me, this was the intention of
         whoever formed the universe, whether all-powerful god, or incorporeal reason creating mighty works, or divine spirit
         penetrating all things from greatest to smallest with even pressure, or fate and the unchanging sequence of causation
         - this, I say, was the intention, that only the most worthless of our possessions should come into the power of
         another. Whatever is best for a human being lies outside human control: it can be neither given nor taken away. The
         world you see, nature’s greatest and most glorious creation, and the human mind which gazes and wonders at it, and is
         the most splendid part of it, these are our own everlasting possessions and will remain with us as long as we
         ourselves remain. So, eager and upright, let us hasten with bold steps wherever circumstances take us, and let us
         journey through any countries whatever: there can be no place of exile within the world since nothing within the
         world is alien to men. From whatever point on the earth’s surface you look up to heaven the same distance lies
         between the realms of gods and men. Accordingly, provided my eyes are not withdrawn from that spectacle, of which
         they never tire; provided I may look upon the sun and the moon and gaze at the other planets; provided I may trace
         their risings and settings, their periods and the causes of their travelling faster or slower; provided I may behold
         all the stars that shine at night - some fixed, others not travelling far afield but circling within the same area;
         some suddenly shooting forth, and others dazzling the eye with scattered fire, as if they are falling, or gliding
         past with a long trail of blazing light; provided I can commune with these and, so far as humans may, associate with
         the divine, and provided I can keep my mind always directed upwards, striving for a vision of kindred things - what
         does it matter what ground I stand on?
         <br>&emsp;‘But this country is not fertile in lush or fruitful trees; no large and navigable rivers irrigate it with
         their channels; it produces nothing which other nations want, being scarcely fertile enough to support its own
         inhabitants. No valuable marble is quarried here, no veins of gold and silver are mined.’ Petty is the mind which
         delights in earthly things: it should be led away to those things which appear everywhere equally, everywhere equally
         lustrous. There is this too to consider, that earthly things stand in the way of genuine goods through a wayward
         belief in false goods. The longer people extend their colonnades, the higher they build their towers, the wider they
         stretch their walks, the deeper they dig their summer grottoes, the more massively they raise the roofs of their
         dining-halls, so much the more will there be to cut off the sight of heaven. Fate has cast you into a land where the
         most luxurious shelter is a hut. Truly you have a petty spirit which meanly comforts itself, if you put up with this
         bravely because you know about the hut of Romulus. Say rather ‘This humble shack gives shelter, I suppose, to the
         virtues. Soon it will be more elegant than any temple when justice is seen to be there, and temperance, wisdom,
         piety, a system for the right allotment of all duties, and the knowledge of man and god. No place is narrow which can
         hold this assembly of such great virtues; no exile is burdensome when you can have this company with you.’
         <br>&emsp;In his treatise ‘On Virtue’ Brutus says that he saw Marcellus in exile at Mytilene, living as happily as
         human nature allows, and never more keen on liberal studies than at that time. And so he adds that when he was about
         to return without Marcellus, he himself seemed to be going into exile rather than leaving the other in exile. How
         much more fortunate was Marcellus at that time when he won the favour of Brutus for his exile than when he won the
         favour of the state for his consulship! What a man that was who caused someone to feel himself an exile because he
         was leaving an exile behind! What a man he was to have won the admiration of a man whom even his kinsman Cato had to
         admire! Brutus also says that Gaius Caesar had sailed past Mytilene because he could not bear the sight of a great
         man in disgrace. Indeed, the senate obtained his recall by public petition: they were so anxious and sorrowful that
         they all seemed to share Brutus’ feelings on that day, and to be pleading not for Marcellus but for themselves, in
         case they would be exiled if deprived of him. But he achieved much more on that day when Brutus could not bear to
         leave, nor Caesar to see, him in exile. For both gave him testimony: Brutus grieved to return without Marcellus, and
         Caesar blushed. Can you doubt that Marcellus, being the great man he was, often encouraged himself thus to endure his
         exile with equanimity? ‘Being without your country is not misery: you have thoroughly taught yourself by your studies
         to know that to a wise man every place is his country. Besides, was not the man who caused your exile himself absent
         from his country for ten consecutive years? No doubt the reason was to enlarge his domains - yet he certainly was
         absent. See, now he is summoned to Africa which is full of threats of further war; to Spain which is reviving its
         forces shattered by defeat; to treacherous Egypt - in short to the whole world which is watchful for an opportunity
         against the stricken empire. Which problem shall he face first? To which quarter take his stand? His own victorious
         course will drive him throughout the world. Let the nations honour and worship him; live yourself content with Brutus
         as your admirer.’
         <br>&emsp;Well did Marcellus, then, endure his exile, nor did his change of abode cause any change at all in his mind
         though poverty attended it. But there is no evil in poverty, as anyone knows who has not yet arrived at the lunatic
         state of greed and luxury, which ruin everything. For how little is needed to support a man! And who can lack this if
         he has any virtue at all? As far as I am concerned, I know that I have lost not wealth but distractions. The body’s
         needs are few: it wants to be free from cold, to banish hunger and thirst with nourishment; if we long for anything
         more we are exerting ourselves to serve our vices, not our needs. We do not need to scour every ocean, or to load our
         bellies with the slaughter of animals, or to pluck shellfish from the unknown shores of the furthest sea. May gods
         and goddesses destroy those whose luxury passes the bounds of an empire that already awakens envy. They seek to stock
         their pretentious kitchens by hunting beyond the Phasis, and they aren’t ashamed to ask for birds from the Parthians,
         from whom we have not yet exacted vengeance. From all sides they collect everything familiar to a fastidious glutton.
         From the furthest sea is brought food which their stomachs, weakened by a voluptuous diet, can scarcely receive. They
         vomit in order to eat, and eat in order to vomit, and banquets for which they ransack the whole world they do not
         even deign to digest. If someone despises all that, what harm can poverty do him? If he longs for it, poverty even
         does him good: for against his will he is being cured, and if even under compulsion he does not take his medicine,
         for a time at least his inability to have those things looks like unwillingness. Gaius Caesar, whom I think nature
         produced as an example of the effect of supreme wickedness in a supreme position, dined in one day at a cost of ten
         million sesterces; and though helped in this by everyone’s ingenuity he could scarcely discover how to spend the
         tribute from three provinces on one dinner. Poor wretches, whose appetite is only tempted by expensive foods! Yet it
         is not an exquisite taste or some delightful effect on the palate that makes them expensive, but their scarcity and
         the difficulty of procuring them. Otherwise, if these people would agree to return to good sense, where is the need
         for all these skills that serve the belly? What need for importing, or laying waste the woodlands, or ransacking the
         ocean? All around food lies ready which nature has distributed in every place; but men pass it by as though blind to
         it, and they scour every country, they cross the seas, and they whet their appetite at great expense when at little
         cost they could satisfy it. I want to say to them: ‘Why do you launch your ships? Why do you arm your bands against
         both beasts and men? Why do you tear around in such a panic? Why do you pile wealth upon wealth? You really must
         consider how small your bodies are. Is it not madness and the worst form of derangement to want so much though you
         can hold so little? Therefore, though you may increase your income and extend your estates, you will never increase
         the capacity of your bodies. Though your business may do well and warfare bring you profit, though you hunt down and
         gather your food from every side, you will not have anywhere to store your supplies. Why do you seek out so many
         things? To be sure, our ancestors were unhappy, whose virtue even now props up our vices, who procured their food
         with their own hands, who slept on the ground, whose dwellings did not yet glitter with gold nor their temples with
         precious stones - and so in those days they swore solemn oaths by gods of clay and, having invoked them, returned to
         the enemy to certain death rather than break their word. To be sure, our dictator who gave audience to the Samnite
         envoys while with his own hand he cooked the simplest sort of food (the hand which already had frequently smitten the
         enemy and placed a laurel wreath on the lap of Capitoline Jupiter) - he lived less happily than Apicius in our time,
         who in the city from which philosophers were once banished as corrupters of the youth, polluted the age by his
         teaching as professor of cookery.’ It is worth hearing what happened to him. When he had spent a hundred million
         sesterces in his kitchen, when he had drunk up at every one of his carousals all those imperial gifts and the
         enormous revenue of the Capitol, then for the first time he was forced by the weight of his debts to look into his
         accounts. He reckoned he would have ten million sesterces left, and that living on ten million would be starvation:
         so he poisoned himself. What luxury, if ten million meant poverty! How then can you think that it is the amount of
         money that matters and not the attitude of mind? Someone dreaded having ten million, and what others pray for he
         escaped by poison. But indeed for a man of such perverted mentality that last drink was the best thing for him. It
         was when he was not merely enjoying but boasting of his huge banquets, when he was making a display of his vices,
         when he was drawing public attention to his vulgar displays, when he was tempting young people to imitate him (who
         even without bad examples are naturally impressionable) - then it was that he was really eating and drinking poisons.
         Such is the fate of those who measure wealth not by the standard of reason, whose limits are fixed, but by that of a
         vicious life-style governed by boundless, uncontrollable caprice. Nothing satisfies greed, but even a little
         satisfies nature. So an exile’s poverty brings no hardship; for no place of exile is so barren that it cannot
         abundantly support a man.
         <br>&emsp;‘But,’ says someone, ‘the exile is going to miss his clothes and home.’ These too he will miss only as far
         as he needs them - and he will lack neither house nor covering; for the body needs as little for protection as for
         food. Nature has not made any of man’s essentials laborious as well. But he must have richly dyed purple clothes,
         woven with gold thread and decorated with multicoloured patterns: it is his fault, not nature’s, if he feels poor.
         Even if you give him back all he has lost, you’ll be wasting your time; for once he is back from exile he will feel a
         greater lack compared with his desires than he felt as an exile compared with his former possessions. But he must
         have furniture gleaming with gold vessels and antique silver plate wrought by famous artists, bronze made valuable
         because a few lunatics want it, a crowd of slaves which would throng a house however large, beasts of burden with
         bodies bloated with force-feeding, marbles from every land: though he piles all these up, they will never sate his
         insatiable soul; just as no amount of fluid will satisfy one whose craving arises not from lack of water but from
         burning internal fever: for that is not a thirst but a disease. Nor is this true only of money or food: the same
         feature is found in every desire which arises not from a lack but from a vice. However much you heap up for it will
         not mark the end of greed, only a stage in it. So the man who restrains himself within the bounds set by nature will
         not notice poverty; the man who exceeds these bounds will be pursued by poverty however rich he is. Life’s
         necessities are found even in places of exile, superfluities not even in kingdoms. It is the mind that creates our
         wealth, and this goes with us into exile, and in the harshest desert places it finds sufficient to nourish the body
         and revels in the enjoyment of its own goods. Money in no way concerns the mind any more than it concerns the gods.
         All those things which are revered by minds untaught and enslaved to their bodies - marble, gold, silver, great round
         polished tables - are earthly burdens which a soul pure and conscious of its nature cannot love: for it is light and
         unencumbered, and destined to soar aloft whenever it is released from the body. Meanwhile, so far as it is not
         hampered by our limbs and this heavy burden that envelops us, it surveys things divine with swift and winged thought.
         So the soul can never suffer exile, being free and akin to the gods and equal to all the universe and all time. For
         its thought encompasses the whole of heaven, and journeys into all past and future time. This wretched body, the
         chain and prison of the soul, is tossed hither and thither; upon it punishment and pillage and disease wreak havoc:
         but the soul itself is holy and eternal, and it cannot be assailed with violence.
         <br>&emsp;In case you think I am simply using the teaching of philosophers to make light of the trials of poverty,
         which no one feels to be a burden unless he thinks it that, first consider that by far the greater proportion of men
         are poor, but you will not see them looking at all more gloomy and anxious than the rich. In fact, I rather suspect
         that they are happier in proportion as their minds have less to harry them. Let us pass on to the rich: how
         frequently are they just like the poor! When they travel abroad their luggage is restricted, and whenever they are
         forced to hasten their journey they dismiss their retinue of attendants. When they are serving in the army, how
         little of their belongings do they keep with them, since camp discipline forbids any luxury! Nor is it only special
         conditions of time and place which put them on a level with the poor in their needs: when on occasion they get tired
         of their riches they choose certain days on which they dine on the ground and, putting aside their gold and silver
         vessels, use earthenware ones. What lunatics, to covet sometimes a condition they always dread! What mental darkness,
         what ignorance of the truth blinds those who, though afflicted by the fear of poverty, yet take pleasure in imitating
         it! For my part, whenever I look back at the fine examples of antiquity, I am ashamed to find consolations for
         poverty, since the luxury of the times has reached the point where an exile’s allowance is more than the inheritance
         of leading men of old. We all know that Homer had one slave, Plato had three, and Zeno, the founder of the strict and
         manly Stoic philosophy, had none. Will anyone on that account say that they lived wretchedly without himself seeming
         to all by his words to be utterly wretched? Menenius Agrippa, who kept the public peace by acting as mediator between
         patricians and plebeians, was buried by public subscription. Atilius Regulus, while he was routing the Carthaginians
         in Africa, wrote to tell the senate that his hired worker had gone off and abandoned his farm: the senate voted that
         during Regulus’ absence the farm should be managed by the state. Was it not worth being without a slave so that the
         Roman people might become his tenant? Scipio’s daughters received a dowry from the state treasury because their
         father had left them nothing: assuredly it was right for the Roman people to offer tribute to Scipio once, since he
         was always exacting it from Carthage. Happy were the girls’ husbands whose father-in-law was the Roman people! Do you
         think those whose pantomime actresses marry with a dowry of a million sesterces are happier than Scipio, whose
         children had the senate for their guardian and received solid copper money as a dowry? Could anyone despise poverty
         with a pedigree so distinguished? Could an exile resent lacking anything, when Scipio lacked a dowry, Regulus a hired
         worker, Menenius a funeral: when for all of them supplying their need was all the more honourable simply because they
         had the need? And so, with these men pleading her cause poverty wins not only acquittal but high esteem.
         <br>&emsp;One might reply, ‘Why do you make an artificial separation of those things which can be borne separately
         but not in combination? You can put up with a change of place if only the place is changed. You can put up with
         poverty if there is no disgrace, which even alone usually crushes the spirit.’ In answer to this man who aims to
         frighten me by an accumulation of ills, this must be said: ‘If you have the strength to tackle any one aspect of
         misfortune you can tackle all. When once virtue has toughened the mind it renders it invulnerable on every side. If
         greed, the most overmastering plague of the human race, has relaxed its grip, ambition will not stand in your way. If
         you regard your last day not as a punishment but as a law of nature, the breast from which you have banished the
         dread of death no fear will dare to enter. If you consider that sexual desire was given to man not for enjoyment but
         for the propagation of the race, once you are free of this violent and destructive passion rooted in your vitals,
         every other desire will leave you undisturbed. Reason routs the vices not one by one but all together: the victory is
         final and complete.’ Do you think that any wise man can be affected by disgrace, one who relies entirely on himself
         and holds aloof from common beliefs? A disgraceful death is worse than disgrace: yet Socrates went to prison with the
         same expression he wore when he once snubbed the Thirty Tyrants - and his presence robbed even prison of disgrace,
         for where Socrates was could not seem a prison. Who is so blind to the truth that he thinks it was a disgrace to
         Marcus Cato that he was twice defeated in his bid for the praetorship and consulship? The disgrace belonged to the
         praetorship and consulship which were being honoured by Cato. No man is despised by another unless he is first
         despised by himself. An abject and debased mind is susceptible to such insult; but if a man stirs himself to face the
         worst of disasters and defeats the evils which overwhelm others, then he wears those very sorrows like a sacred
         badge. For we are naturally disposed to admire more than anything else the man who shows fortitude in adversity. When
         Aristides was being led to execution at Athens, everyone who met him cast down his eyes and groaned, as though it was
         not merely a just man but Justice herself who was being punished. Yet one man actually spat in his face. He could
         have resented this because he knew that only a foul-mouthed man would dare to do it. Instead he wiped his face, and
         with a smile he said to the magistrate escorting him: ‘Warn that fellow not to give such a vulgar yawn another time.’
         This was to retaliate insult upon insult. I know some people say that nothing is worse than scorn and that even death
         seems preferable. To these I shall reply that exile too is often free from any kind of scorn. If a great man falls
         and remains great as he lies, people no more despise him than they stamp on a fallen temple, which the devout still
         worship as much as when it was standing.
         <br>&emsp;Dearest mother, since you have no cause on my account to drive you to endless tears it follows that reasons
         regarding yourself are urging you to weep. Well, there are two: you are bothered either because you seem to have lost
         some protection, or because you cannot endure the very thought of doing without me.
         <br>&emsp;The first point I must touch upon only slightly, for I know that your heart loves your dear ones for
         themselves alone. Let those mothers reflect on this who exploit their children’s influence with a woman’s lack of
         influence; who, because women cannot hold office, seek power through their sons; who both drain their sons’
         inheritances and try to get them; who exhaust their sons by lending their eloquence to others. Whereas you have taken
         the greatest pleasure in your sons’ gifts and made the least use of them; you have always set a limit to our
         generosity without limiting your own; while your father was still alive you actually gave gifts to your wealthy sons;
         you administered our inheritances as though you were earnestly looking after your own and being scrupulously
         provident with another’s; you were cautious in using our influence, as if it were someone else’s, and in our spells
         in office you had no part except your pleasure and the expenses. Your love never had regard for self-interest:
         therefore, now that your son has been taken from you, you cannot feel the lack of those things which you never
         thought concerned you when he was safe and sound.
         <br>&emsp;I must direct my consolation entirely to that point from which arises the true force of a mother’s grief.
         You say, ‘So I am deprived of my dearest son’s embrace; I can’t enjoy seeing him or talking to him. Where is he whose
         appearance smoothed my troubled brow, to whom I confided all my woes? Where are our conversations of which I never
         tired? Where are his studies which I shared with more than a feminine eagerness and more than a mother’s intimacy?
         Where are our meetings? Where is the unfailing boyish glee at the sight of his mother?’ To all this you add the
         actual places where we rejoiced together and socialized, and the reminders of our recent life together which are
         inevitably the most acute source of mental anguish. For Fortune plotted even this cruel blow against you, that only
         two days before I was struck down she contrived that you should depart tranquil in mind and fearing no such disaster.
         It was well that we had lived far apart, and that an absence of some years had prepared you for this blow. By
         returning you did not gain the pleasure of your son’s presence, but you lost the habit of bearing his absence. If you
         had been away long before you would have borne the loss more bravely, as the very distance between us would have
         softened the longing. If you had not gone away you would at least have had the final pleasure of seeing your son for
         two days longer. As it was, cruel fate so arranged it that you could neither be present at my misfortune nor get used
         to my absence. But the harsher these circumstances are, the greater the courage you must summon up and the more
         fiercely you must fight, as with an enemy you know and have often defeated. Your blood has not now flowed from an
         undamaged body: you have been struck exactly where the old scars are.
         <br>&emsp;You must not excuse yourself as being a woman, who has been virtually given the right to indulge
         excessively, but not endlessly, in tears. With this in view our ancestors allowed widows to mourn their husbands for
         ten months, in order to compromise by public decree with the stubbornness of female grief. They did not prohibit
         mourning but they limited it. For to be afflicted with endless sorrow at the loss of someone very dear is foolish
         self-indulgence, and to feel none is inhuman callousness. The best compromise between love and good sense is both to
         feel longing and to conquer it. You must not pay regard to certain women whose grief, once assumed, was ended only by
         death - you know some who never removed the mourning dress they put on when they lost their sons. Your life was
         braver from its start and expects more from you: the excuse of being a woman does not apply to one from whom all
         womanly faults have been absent. That worst evil of our time, unchastity, has not numbered you among the majority of
         women; neither jewels nor pearls have influenced you; the glitter of wealth has not struck you as the greatest
         blessing of the human race; you were brought up in a strict, old- fashioned home and never deviated into the
         imitation of worse women which is dangerous even to good ones; you were never ashamed of your fertility as if it
         taunted you with your advancing years; never did you follow other women who seek only to impress by their looks, and
         hide your pregnancy as if it were an indecent burden, nor did you destroy the hopes of giving birth by abortion; you
         did not spoil your complexion by paints and cosmetics; you never liked the sort of garment which revealed no more
         when it was taken off; in you has been seen that matchless ornament, that loveliest beauty which is not dependent on
         any time of life, that greatest glory of all - modesty. So you cannot, in order to justify your grief, claim the name
         of woman from which your virtues have set you apart: you ought to be as immune to female tears as to female vices.
         Not even women will allow you to waste away from your wound, but they will tell you to get your necessary mourning
         speedily over with and rise again comforted, by willing yourself to keep in mind those women whose conspicuous
         courage has ranked them with great men. Fortune reduced Cornelia’s twelve children to two: if you wanted to count
         Cornelia’s bereavements, she had lost ten; if you wanted to appraise them, she had lost the Gracchi. But when those
         around her were weeping and cursing her fate she forbad them to accuse Fortune, which had given her the Gracchi as
         her sons. It was a fitting son of this mother who said in the assembly, ‘Would you insult the mother who gave me
         birth?’ Yet his mother’s words seem to me much more spirited: the son was proud of the parentage of the Gracchi, the
         mother of their deaths as well. Rutilia followed her son Cotta into exile, and was so singleminded in her devotion
         that she preferred exile to miss-ing him, and returned home only when he did. And when, restored to favour and a
         distinguished public figure, he died, she bore his loss as bravely as she had shared his exile, nor was she ever seen
         to weep after his funeral. She showed courage when he was exiled and wisdom when he died; for nothing stopped her
         showing her love and nothing induced her to persist in useless and unavailing grief. It is with women like these that
         I want you to be numbered. You always imitated their way of life, and you will best follow their example in
         controlling and conquering your sorrow.
         <br>&emsp;I know that this is not something which is in our power and that no strong feeling is under our control,
         least of all that which arises from sorrow: for it is violent and violently resists every remedy. Sometimes we want
         to crush it and swallow down our groans, but through the pretended composure of our features the tears pour down.
         Sometimes we divert our mind with public shows or gladiatorial contests, but in the very midst of the distractions of
         the spectacles it is undermined by some little reminder of its loss. Therefore it is better to conquer our grief than
         to deceive it. For if it has withdrawn, being merely beguiled by pleasures and preoccupations, it starts up again and
         from its very respite gains force to savage us. But the grief that has been conquered by reason is calmed for ever. I
         am not therefore going to prescribe for you those remedies which I know many people have used, that you divert or
         cheer yourself by a long or pleasant journey abroad, or spend a lot of time carefully going through your accounts and
         administering your estate, or constantly be involved in some new activity. All those things help only for a short
         time; they do not cure grief but hinder it. But I would rather end it than distract it. And so I am leading you to
         that resource which must be the refuge of all who are flying from Fortune, liberal studies. They will heal your
         wound, they will withdraw all your melancholy. Even if you had never been familiar with them you would have need of
         them now. But, so far as the old-fashioned strictness of my father allowed, you have had some acquaintance with the
         liberal arts, even if you have not mastered them. If only my father, best of men, had been less devoted to ancestral
         tradition, and had been willing that you be steeped in the teaching of philosophy and not just gain a smattering of
         it: you would not now have to acquire your defence against Fortune but just bring it forth. He was less inclined to
         let you pursue your studies because of those women who use books not to acquire wisdom but as the furniture of
         luxury. Yet thanks to your vigorously inquiring mind you absorbed a lot considering the time you had available: the
         foundations of all formal studies have been laid. Return now to these studies and they will keep you safe. They will
         comfort you, they will delight you; and if they genuinely penetrate your mind, never again will grief enter there, or
         anxiety, or the distress caused by futile and pointless suffering. Your heart will have room for none of these, for
         to all other failings it has long been closed. Those studies are your most dependable protection, and they alone can
         snatch you from Fortune’s grip.
         <br>&emsp;But until you arrive at this haven which philosophy holds out to you, you must have supports to lean on: so
         I want meanwhile to point out your own consolations. Consider my brothers: while they live you have no reason to
         complain of your fortune. In both you have contrasting virtues to cheer you up: the one achieved public office by his
         energy, the other in his wisdom despised it. Take comfort in the distinction of the one, the retirement of the other,
         and the devotion of both. I know the innermost feelings of my brothers. The one fosters his distinction really in
         order to bring honour to you, while the other has retired into peace and tranquillity in order to have leisure for
         you. Fortune has done you a service in arranging that your children should bring you both assistance and delight: you
         can be protected by the distinction of the one and you can enjoy the leisure of the other. They will be rivals in
         their services to you, and the devotion of two will fill the blank space left by one. I promise you with complete
         confidence that you will miss nothing but the number of sons.
         <br>&emsp;After these consider too your grandchildren: Marcus, a most charming child - you could not remain sorrowful
         while looking at him, and no one’s heart could suffer anguish too great or too recent not to be soothed by his
         embrace. Whose tears would his merriment not allay? Whose heart gripped by anxious care would not relax at his lively
         chatter? Who will not smile at his playfulness? Whose attention, however fixed on his own thoughts, will not be
         attracted and held by that prattling which no one could tire of? I pray to the gods that he may survive us! May all
         the cruelty of fate wear itself out and stop at me. Whatever you were destined to suffer as a mother and as a
         grandmother may I represent. Let the rest of my family flourish undisturbed. I shall not complain of my childlessness
         or my exile, if only I prove to be the scapegoat for a family that will suffer no more. Embrace Novatilla, who will
         soon give you great-grandchildren; I had so attached her to myself and adopted her that in losing me she could seem
         an orphan, though her father is alive. Cherish her for me too. Fortune recently took away her mother, but your love
         will mean that she will only grieve over her mother’s loss but not suffer for it. Now you must shape and compose her
         character: teaching sinks more deeply into those of impressionable years. Let her grow used to your conversation and
         be moulded as you think right; you will be giving her a great deal even if you give her only your example. Such a
         sacred duty as this will act as a cure for you, for only philosophy or honourable occupation can divert from its
         anguish a heart whose grief springs from love.
         <br>&emsp;I would reckon your father too among your great comforts if he were not absent. As it is, you must now
         judge his love for you by your love for him, and you will realize how much more just it is for you to preserve
         yourself for him than sacrifice yourself for me. Whenever excessive grief attacks you and urges you to give way to
         it, think of your father. Certainly, by giving him so many grandchildren and great-grandchildren you ceased to be his
         only offspring; but for him the completion of a happy life depends on you. While he lives it is wrong for you to
         complain that you have lived.
         <br>&emsp;Up to now I have said nothing about your greatest comfort, your sister, that heart most faithful to you
         into which are poured unreservedly all your anxieties, that soul which has been a mother to us all. You mingled your
         tears with hers; on her bosom you first began to breathe again. Always indeed she shares your feelings, but in my
         case she grieves not only for you. She carried me in her arms to Rome. During my long illness it was her loving and
         motherly nursing that brought me round. When I was a candidate for the quaestorship she supported me and, though she
         normally lacked the confidence even for conversation or a loud greeting, for my sake love conquered shyness. Neither
         her sheltered manner of living, nor her modesty (old-fashioned when compared with the prevalent brazenness of women),
         nor her tranquillity, nor her reserved nature which wanted peace and quiet - none of these prevented her from
         actually becoming ambitious on my behalf. She, dearest mother, is the source of comfort from which you can revive
         yourself: cling to her as much as you can in the closest embraces. Sorrowers tend to avoid what they are most fond of
         and try to give vent to their grief; but you must share all your thoughts with her. Whether you wish to keep this
         mood or lay it aside, you will find in her either the end of your sorrow or one who will share it. But if I know the
         wisdom of this paragon of women, she will not allow you to be consumed in profitless anguish, and she will tell you
         of an edifying episode in her life which I also witnessed.
         <br>&emsp;While actually on a sea voyage she lost her beloved husband, my uncle, whom she had married as a maiden;
         yet she bore simultaneously the burdens of grief and fear and, though shipwrecked, she rode out the storms and
         brought his body safely ashore. O how many noble deeds of women are lost in obscurity! If she had chanced to live in
         the days of old when people frankly admired heroism, how men of genius would have competed to sing the praises of a
         wife who ignored her physical weakness, ignored the sea which even the bravest must fear, and risked her life to give
         her husband burial; and while her thoughts were on his funeral had no fears about her own! All the poets have given
         renown to the woman who offered to die in place of her husband. But this is nobler, to risk one’s life to bury one’s
         husband: for that love is greater which wins less through equal danger.
         <br>&emsp;After this it can surprise no one that during the sixteen years her husband governed Egypt she was never
         seen in public, she received no provincial into her home, she never petitioned her husband for a favour, and she
         never allowed herself to be petitioned. The result was that a province given to gossip and clever at insulting its
         rulers, where even those who had avoided wrongdoing did not escape scandal, respected her as a singular pattern of
         integrity, restrained all licence in its speech (a very difficult achievement where even dangerous witticisms are
         popular), and even to this day keeps hoping, though it never expects, to see another like her. It would have been a
         great achievement if she had won the approval of the province for sixteen years; it was even better not to have been
         noticed there. I do not recall these things in order to list her good qualities (to rehearse them so sketchily is to
         be unfair to them), but to give you an idea of the high-mindedness of the woman who was not conquered by ambition or
         greed, those inevitable com-panions and curses of power; who, facing shipwreck on a disabled boat, was not deterred
         by the fear of death from clinging to her dead husband and seeking not the means of her own escape but the means of
         getting his body off for burial. This is the sort of courage you must match, by withdrawing your mind from grief and
         resolving that no one shall think you regret having had children.
         <br>&emsp;However, whatever you do, inevitably your thoughts will turn to me constantly, and none of your other
         children will come to your mind more often, not because they are less dear to you but because it is natural to touch
         more often the part that hurts. So this is how you must think of me - happy and cheerful as if in the best of
         circumstances. For they are best, since my mind, without any preoccupation, is free for its own tasks, now delighting
         in more trivial studies, now in its eagerness for the truth rising up to ponder its own nature and that of the
         universe. It seeks to know first about lands and their location, then the nature of the encompassing sea and its
         tidal ebb and flow. Then it studies all the awesome expanse which lies between heaven and earth - this nearer space
         turbulent with thunder, lightning, gales of wind, and falling rain, snow and hail. Finally, having scoured the lower
         areas it bursts through to the heights and enjoys the noblest sight of divine things and, mindful of its own
         immortality, it ranges over all that has been and will be throughout all ages.

      <div class="content-text hidden" id="TheWiseMan">
         I might truly say, Serenus, that there is as wide a difference between the Stoics and the other sects of philosophers
         as there is between men and women, since each class contributes an equal share to human society, but the one is born
         to command, the other to obey. The other philosophers deal with us gently and coaxingly, just as our accustomed
         family physicians usually do with our bodies, treating them not by the best and shortest method, but by that which we
         allow them to employ; whereas the Stoics adopt a manly course, and do not care about its appearing attractive to
         those who are entering upon it, but that it should as quickly as possible take us out of the world, and lead us to
         that lofty eminence which is so far beyond the scope of any missile weapon that it is above the reach of Fortune
         herself. “But the way by which we are asked to climb is steep and uneven.” What then? Can heights be reached by a
         level path? Yet they are not so sheer and precipitous as some think. It is only the first part that has rocks and
         cliffs and no apparent outlet, just as many hills seen from a long way off appear abruptly steep and joined together,
         because the distance deceives our sight, and then, as we draw nearer, those very hills which our mistaken eyes had
         made into one gradually unfold themselves, those parts which seemed precipitous from afar assume a gently sloping
         outline. When just now mention was made of Marcus Cato, you whose mind revolts at injustice were indignant at Cato’s
         own age having so little understood him, at its having allotted a place below Vatinius to one who towered above both
         Caesar and Pompeius; it seemed shameful to you, that when he spoke against some law in the Forum his toga was torn
         from him, and that he was hustled through the hands of a mutinous mob from the Rostra as far as the arch of Fabius,
         enduring all the bad language, spitting, and other insults of the frantic rabble.
         <br>&emsp;I then answered, that you had good cause to be anxious on behalf of the commonwealth, which Publius Clodius
         on the one side, Vatinius and all the greatest scoundrels on the other, were putting up for sale, and, carried away
         by their blind covetousness, did not understand that when they sold it they themselves were sold with it; I bade you
         have no fears on behalf of Cato himself, because the wise man can neither receive injury nor insult, and it is more
         certain that the immortal gods have given Cato as a pattern of a wise man to us, than that they gave Ulysses or
         Hercules to the earlier ages; for these our Stoics have declared were wise men, unconquered by labours, despisers of
         pleasure, and superior to all terrors. Cato did not slay wild beasts, whose pursuit belongs to huntsmen and
         countrymen, nor did he exterminate fabulous creatures with fire and sword, or live in times when it was possible to
         believe that the heavens could be supported on the shoulders of one man. In an age which had thrown off its belief in
         antiquated superstitions, and had carried material knowledge to its highest point, he had to struggle against that
         many-headed monster, ambition, against that boundless lust for power which the whole world divided among three men
         could not satisfy. He alone withstood the vices of a worn-out State, sinking into ruin through its own bulk; he
         upheld the falling commonwealth as far as it could be upheld by one man’s hand, until at last his support was
         withdrawn, and he shared the crash which he had so long averted, and perished together with that from which it was
         impious to separate him—for Cato did not outlive freedom, nor did freedom outlive Cato. Think you that the people
         could do any wrong to such a man when they tore away his praetorship or his toga? when they bespattered his sacred
         head with the rinsings of their mouths? The wise man is safe, and no injury or insult can touch him.
         <br>&emsp;I think I see your excited and boiling temper. You are preparing to exclaim: “These are the things which
         take away all weight from your maxims; you promise great matters, such as I should not even wish for, let alone
         believe to be possible, and then, after all your brave words, though you say that the wise man is not poor, you admit
         that he often is in want of servants, shelter, and food. You say that the wise man is not mad, yet you admit that he
         sometimes loses his reason, talks nonsense, and is driven to the wildest actions by the stress of his disorder. When
         you say that the wise man cannot be a slave, you do not deny that he will be sold, carry out orders, and perform
         menial services at the bidding of his master; so, for all your proud looks, you come down to the level of everyone
         else, and merely call things by different names. Consequently, I suspect that something of this kind lurks behind
         this maxim, which at first sight appears so beautiful and noble, ‘that the wise man can neither receive injury nor
         insult.’ It makes a great deal of difference whether you declare that the wise man is beyond feeling resentment, or
         beyond receiving injury; for if you say that he will bear it calmly, he has no special privilege in that, for he has
         developed a very common quality, and one which is learned by long endurance of wrong itself, namely, patience. If you
         declare that he can never receive an injury, that is, that no one will attempt to do him one, then I will throw up
         all my occupations in life and become a Stoic.”
         <br>&emsp;It has not been my object to decorate the wise man with mere imaginary verbal honours, but to raise him to
         a position where no injury will be permitted to reach him. “What? will there be no one to tease him, to try to wrong
         him?” There is nothing on earth so sacred as not to be liable to sacrilege; yet holy things exist on high none the
         less because there are men who strike at a greatness which is far above themselves, though with no hope of reaching
         it. The invulnerable is not that which is never struck, but that which is never wounded. In this class I will show
         you the wise man. Can we doubt that the strength which is never overcome in fight is more to be relied on than that
         which is never challenged, seeing that untested power is untrustworthy, whereas that solidity which hurls back all
         attacks is deservedly regarded as the most trustworthy of all? In like manner you may know that the wise man, if no
         injury hurts him, is of a higher type than if none is offered to him, and I should call him a brave man whom war does
         not subdue and the violence of the enemy does not alarm, not him who enjoys luxurious ease amid a slothful people. I
         say, then, that such a wise man is invulnerable against all injury; it matters not, therefore, how many darts be
         hurled at him, since he can be pierced by none of them. Just as the hardness of some stones is impervious to steel,
         and adamant can neither be cut, broken, or ground, but blunts all instruments used upon it; just as some things
         cannot be destroyed by fire, but when encircled by flame still retain their hardness and shape; just as some tall
         projecting cliffs break the waves of the sea, and though lashed by them through many centuries, yet show no traces of
         their rage; even so the mind of the wise man is firm, and gathers so much strength, that it is as safe from injury as
         any of those things which I have mentioned.
         <br>&emsp;“What then? Will there be no one who will try to do an injury to the wise man?” Yes, someone will try, but
         the injury will not reach him; for he is separated from the contact of his inferiors by so wide a distance that no
         evil impulse can retain its power of harm until it reaches him. Even when powerful men, raised to positions of high
         authority, and strong in the obedience of their dependents, strive to injure him, all their darts fall as far short
         of his wisdom as those which are shot upwards by bowstrings or catapults, which, although they rise so high as to
         pass out of sight, yet fall back again without reaching the heavens. Why, do you suppose that when that stupid
         king[1] clouded the daylight with the multitude of his darts, that any arrow of them all went into the sun? or that
         when he flung his chains into the deep, that he was able to reach Neptune? Just as sacred things escape from the
         hands of men, and no injury is done to the godhead by those who destroy temples and melt down images, so whoever
         attempts to treat the wise man with impertinence, insolence, or scorn, does so in vain. “It would be better,” say
         you, “if no one wished to do so.” You are expressing a wish that the whole human race were inoffensive, which may
         hardly be; moreover, those who would gain by such wrongs not being done are those who would do them, not he who could
         not suffer from them even if they were done; nay, I know not whether wisdom is not best displayed by calmness in the
         midst of annoyances, just as the greatest proof of a general’s strength in arms and men consists in his quietness and
         confidence in the midst of an enemy’s country.
         <br>&emsp;If you think fit, my Serenus, let us distinguish between injury and insult. The former is naturally the
         more grievous, the latter less important, and grievous only to the thin-skinned, since it angers men but does not
         wound them. Yet such is the weakness of men’s minds, that many think that there is nothing more bitter than insult;
         thus you will find slaves who prefer to be flogged to being slapped, and who think stripes and death more endurable
         than insulting words. To such a pitch of absurdity have we come that we suffer not only from pain, but from the idea
         of pain, like children, who are terror-stricken by darkness, misshapen masks, and distorted faces, and whose tears
         flow at hearing names unpleasing to their ears, at the movement of our fingers, and other things which they
         ignorantly shrink from with a sort of mistaken spasm. The object which injury proposes to itself is to do evil to
         someone. Now wisdom leaves no room for evil; to it, the only evil is baseness, which cannot enter into the place
         already occupied by virtue and honour. If, therefore, there can be no injury without evil, and no evil without
         baseness, and baseness cannot find any place with a man who is already filled with honour, it follows that no injury
         can reach the wise man; for if injury be the endurance of some evil, and the wise man can endure no evil, it follows
         that no injury takes effect upon the wise man. All injury implies a making less of that which it affects, and no one
         can sustain an injury without some loss either of his dignity, or of some part of his body, or of some of the things
         external to ourselves; but the wise man can lose nothing. He has invested everything in himself, has entrusted
         nothing to fortune, has his property in safety, and is content with virtue, which does not need casual accessories,
         and therefore can neither be increased or diminished; for virtue, as having attained to the highest position, has no
         room for addition to herself, and fortune can take nothing away save what she gave. Now fortune does not give virtue;
         therefore she does not take it away. Virtue is free, inviolable, not to be moved, not to be shaken, and so hardened
         against misfortunes that she cannot be bent, let alone overcome by them. She looks unfalteringly on while tortures
         are being prepared for her; she makes no change of countenance, whether misery or pleasure be offered to her. The
         wise man therefore can lose nothing of whose loss he will be sensible, for he is the property of virtue alone, from
         whom he never can be taken away. He enjoys all other things at the good pleasure of fortune; but who is grieved at
         the loss of what is not his own? If, injury can hurt none of those things which are the peculiar property of the wise
         man, because while his virtue is safe they are safe, then it is impossible that an injury should be done to a wise
         man. Demetrius, who was surnamed Poliorcetes, took Megara, and the philosopher Stilbo, when asked by him whether he
         had lost anything, answered, “No, I carry all my property about me.” Yet his inheritance had been given up to
         pillage, his daughters had been outraged by the enemy, his country had fallen under a foreign dominion, and it was
         the king, enthroned on high, surrounded by the spears of his victorious troops, who put this question to him; yet he
         struck the victory out of the king’s hands, and proved that, though the city was taken, he himself was not only
         unconquered but unharmed, for he bore with him those true goods which no one can lay hands upon. What was being
         plundered and carried away hither and thither he did not consider to be his own, but to be merely things which come
         and go at the caprice of fortune; therefore he had not loved them as his own, for the possession of all things which
         come from without is slippery and insecure.
         <br>&emsp;Consider now, whether any thief, or false accuser, or headstrong neighbour, or rich man enjoying the power
         conferred by a childless old age, could do any injury to this man, from whom neither war nor an enemy whose
         profession was the noble art of battering city walls could take away anything. Amid the flash of swords on all sides,
         and the riot of the plundering soldiery, amid the flames and blood and ruin of the fallen city, amid the crash of
         temples falling upon their gods, one man was at peace. You need not therefore account that a reckless boast, for
         which I will give you a surety, if my words goes for nothing. Indeed, you would hardly believe so much constancy or
         such greatness of mind to belong to any man; but here a man comes forward to prove that you have no reason for
         doubting that one who is but of human birth can raise himself above human necessities, can tranquilly behold pains,
         losses, diseases, wounds, and great natural convulsions roaring around him, can bear adversity with calm and
         prosperity with moderation, neither yielding to the former nor trusting to the latter, that he can remain the same
         amid all varieties of fortune, and think nothing to be his own save himself, and himself too only as regards his
         better part. “Behold,” says he, “I am here to prove to you that although, under the direction of that destroyer of so
         many cities, walls may be shaken by the stroke of the ram, lofty towers may be suddenly brought low by galleries and
         hidden mines, and mounds arise so high as to rival the highest citadel, yet that no siege engines can be discovered
         which can shake a well-established mind. I have just crept from amid the ruins of my house, and with conflagrations
         blazing all around I have escaped from the flames through blood. What fate has befallen my daughters, whether a worse
         one than that of their country, I know not. Alone and elderly, and seeing everything around me in the hands of the
         enemy, still I declare that my property is whole and untouched. I have, I hold whatever of mine I have ever had.
         There is no reason for you to suppose me conquered and yourself my conqueror. It is your fortune which has overcome
         mine. As for those fleeting possessions which change their owners, I know not where they are; what belongs to myself
         is with me, and ever will be. I see rich men who have lost their estates; lustful men who have lost their loves, the
         courtesans whom they cherished at the cost of much shame; ambitious men who have lost the senate, the law courts, the
         places set apart for the public display of men’s vices; usurers who have lost their account-books, in which avarice
         vainly enjoyed an unreal wealth; but I possess everything whole and uninjured. Leave me, and go and ask those who are
         weeping and lamenting over the loss of their money, who are offering their bare breasts to drawn swords in its
         defence, or who are fleeing from the enemy with weighty pockets.” See then, Serenus, that the perfect man, full of
         human and divine virtues, can lose nothing; his goods are surrounded by strong and impassable walls. You cannot
         compare with them the walls of Babylon, which Alexander entered, nor the fortifications of Carthage and Numantia, won
         by one and the same hand, nor the Capitol and citadel of Rome, which are branded with the marks of the victors’
         insults; the ramparts which protect the wise man are safe from fire and hostile invasion; they afford no passage;
         they are lofty, impregnable, divine.
         <br>&emsp;You have no cause for saying, as you are wont to do, that this wise man of ours[3] is nowhere to be found;
         we do not invent him as an unreal glory of the human race, or conceive a mighty shadow of an untruth, but we have
         displayed and will display him just as we sketch him, though he may perhaps be uncommon, and only one appears at long
         intervals; for what is great and transcends the common ordinary type is not often produced; but this very Marcus Cato
         himself, the mention of whom started this discussion, was a man who I fancy even surpassed our model. Moreover, that
         which hurts must be stronger than that which is hurt. Now wickedness is not stronger than virtue; therefore the wise
         man cannot be hurt. Only the bad attempt to injure the good. Good men are at peace among themselves; bad ones are
         equally mischievous to the good and to one another. If a man cannot be hurt by one weaker than himself, and a bad man
         be weaker than a good one, and the good have no injury to dread, except from one unlike themselves; then, no injury
         takes effect upon the wise man; for by this time I need not remind you that no one save the wise man is good.
         <br>&emsp;“If,” says our adversary, “Socrates was unjustly condemned, he received an injury.” At this point it is
         needful for us to bear in mind that it is possible for someone to do an injury to me, and yet for me not to receive
         it, as if any one were to steal something from my country-house and leave it in my town-house, that man would commit
         a theft, yet I should lose nothing. A man may become mischievous, and yet do no actual mischief: if a man lies with
         his own wife as if she were a stranger, he will commit adultery, but his wife will not; if a man gives me poison and
         the poison lose its strength when mixed with food, that man, by administering the poison, has made himself a
         criminal, even though he has done no hurt. A man is no less a brigand because his sword becomes entangled in his
         victim’s clothes and misses its mark. All crimes, as far as concerns their criminality, are completed before the
         actual deed is accomplished. Some crimes are of such a nature and bound by such conditions that the first part can
         take place without the second, though the second cannot take place without the first. I will endeavour to explain
         these words: I can move my feet and yet not run; but I cannot run without moving my feet. I can be in the water
         without swimming; but if I swim, I cannot help being in the water. The matter of which we are treating is of this
         character: if I have received an injury, it is necessary that someone must have done it to me; but if an injury has
         been done me, it is not necessary that I should have received one; for many circumstances may intervene to avert the
         injury, as, for example, some chance may strike the hand that is aiming at us, and the dart, after it has been
         thrown, may swerve aside. So injuries of all kinds may by certain circumstances be thrown back and intercepted in
         mid-course, so that they may be done and yet not received.
         <br>&emsp;Moreover, justice can suffer nothing unjust, because contraries cannot co-exist; but an injury can only be
         done unjustly, therefore an injury cannot be done to the wise man. Nor need you wonder at no one being able to do him
         an injury; for no one can do him any good service either. The wise man lacks nothing which he can accept by way of a
         present, and the bad man can bestow nothing that is worthy of the wise man’s acceptance; for he must possess it
         before he can bestow it, and he possesses nothing which the wise man would rejoice to have handed over to him.
         Consequently, no one can do either harm or good to the wise man, because divine things neither want help nor are
         capable of being hurt; and the wise man is near, indeed very near to the gods, being like a god in every respect save
         that he is mortal. As he presses forward and makes his way towards the life that is sublime, well-ordered, without
         fear, proceeding in a regular and harmonious course, tranquil, beneficent, made for the good of mankind useful both
         to itself and to others, he will neither long nor weep for anything that is grovelling. He who, trusting to reason,
         passes through human affairs with godlike mind, has no quarter from which he can receive injury. Do you suppose that
         I mean merely from no man? He cannot receive an injury even from fortune, which, whenever she contends with virtue,
         always retires beaten. If we accept with an undisturbed and tranquil mind that greatest terror of all, beyond which
         the angry laws and the most cruel masters have nothing to threaten us with, in which fortune’s dominion is
         contained—if we know that death is not an evil, and therefore is not an injury either, we shall much more easily
         endure the other things, such as losses, pains, disgraces, changes of abode, bereavements, and partings, which do not
         overwhelm the wise man even if they all befall him at once, much less does he grieve at them when they assail him
         separately. And if he bears the injuries of fortune calmly, how much more will he bear those of powerful men, whom he
         knows to be the hands of fortune.
         <br>&emsp;He therefore endures everything in the same spirit with which he endures the cold of winter and the
         severities of climate, fevers, diseases, and other chance accidents, nor does he entertain so high an opinion of any
         man as to suppose that he acts of set purpose, which belongs to the wise man alone. All other men have no plans, but
         only plots and deceits and irregular impulses of mind, which he reckons the same as pure accident; now, what depends
         upon pure accident cannot rage around us designedly. He reflects, also, that the largest sources of injury are to be
         found in those things by means of which danger is sought for against us, as, for example, by a suborned accuser, or a
         false charge, or by the stirring up against us of the anger of great men, and the other forms of the brigandage of
         civilized life. Another common type of injury is when a man loses some profit or prize for which he has long been
         angling, when an inheritance which he has spent great pains to render his own is left to someone else, or the favour
         of some noble house, through which he makes great gain, is taken from him. The wise man escapes all this, since he
         knows not what it is to live for hope or for fear. Add to this, that no one receives an injury unmoved, but is
         disturbed by the feeling of it. Now, the man free from mistakes has no disturbance; he is master of himself, enjoying
         a deep and tranquil repose of mind,; for if an injury reaches him it moves and rouses him. But the wise man is
         without anger, which is caused by the appearance of injury, and he could not be free from anger unless he were also
         free from injury, which he knows cannot be done to him; hence it is that he is so upright and cheerful, hence he is
         elate with constant joy. So far, however, is he from shrinking from the encounter either of circumstances or of men,
         that he makes use of injury itself to make trial of himself and test his own virtue. Let us, I beseech you, show
         favour to this thesis and listen with impartial ears and minds while the wise man is being made exempt from injury;
         for nothing is thereby taken away from your insolence, your greediest lusts, your blind rashness and pride; it is
         without prejudice to your vices that this freedom is sought for the wise man; we do not strive to prevent your doing
         an injury, but to enable him to sink all injuries beneath himself and protect himself from them by his own greatness
         of mind. So in the sacred games many have won the victory by patiently enduring the blows of their adversaries and so
         wearying them out. Think that the wise man belongs to this class, that of men who, by long and faithful practice,
         have acquired strength to endure and tire out all the violence of their enemies.
         <br>&emsp;Since we have now discussed the first part of our subject, let us pass on to the second, in which we will
         prove by arguments, some of which are our own, but which for the most part are Stoic commonplaces, that the wise man
         cannot be insulted. There is a lesser form of injury, which we must complain of rather than avenge, which the laws
         also have considered not to deserve any special punishment. This passion is produced by a meanness of mind which
         shrinks at any act or deed which treats it with disrespect. “He did not admit me to his house today, although he
         admitted others; he either turned haughtily away or openly laughed when I spoke;” or, “he placed me at dinner, not on
         the middle couch (the place of honour), but on the lowest one;” and other matters of the same sort; which I can call
         nothing but the whinings of a queasy spirit. These matters chiefly affect the luxuriously-nurtured and prosperous;
         for those who are pressed by worse evils have no time to notice such things as these. Through excessive idleness,
         dispositions naturally weak and womanish and prone to indulge in fancies through want of real injuries are disturbed
         at these things, the greater part of which arise from misunderstanding. He therefore who is affected by insult shows
         that he possesses neither sense nor trustfulness; for he considers it certain that he is scorned, and this vexation
         affects him with a certain sense of degradation, as he effaces himself and takes a lower room; whereas the wise man
         is scorned by no one, for he knows his own greatness, gives himself to understand that he allows no one to have such
         power over him, and as for all of what I should not so much call distress as uneasiness of mind, he does not overcome
         it, but never so much as feels it. Some other things strike the wise man, though they may not shake his principles,
         such as bodily pain and weakness, the loss of friends and children, and the ruin of his country in war-time. I do not
         say that the wise man does not feel these, for we do not ascribe to him the hardness of stone or iron; there is no
         virtue but is conscious of its own endurance. What then does he? He receives some blows, but when he has received
         them he rises superior to them, heals them, and brings them to an end; these more trivial things he does not even
         feel, nor does he make use of his accustomed fortitude in the endurance of evil against them, but either takes no
         notice of them or considers them to deserve to be laughed at.
         <br>&emsp;Besides this, as most insults proceed from those who are haughty and arrogant and bear their prosperity
         ill, he has something wherewith to repel this haughty passion, namely, that noblest of all the virtues, magnanimity,
         which passes over everything of that kind as like unreal apparitions in dreams and visions of the night, which have
         nothing in them substantial or true. At the same time he reflects that all men are too low to venture to look down
         upon what is so far above them. The Latin word ‘‘contumelia’’ is derived from the word contempt, because no one does
         that injury to another unless he regards him with contempt; and no one can treat his elders and betters with
         contempt, even though he does what contemptuous persons are wont to do; for children strike their parents’ faces,
         infants rumple and tear their mother’s hair, and spit upon her and expose what should be covered before her, and do
         not shrink from using dirty language; yet we do not call any of these things contemptuous. And why? Because he who
         does it is not able to show contempt. For the same reason the scurrilous raillery of our slaves against their masters
         amuses us, as their boldness only gains licence to exercise itself at the expense of the guests if they begin with
         the master; and the more contemptible and the more an object of derision each one of them is, the greater licence he
         gives his tongue. Some buy forward slave-boys for this purpose, cultivate their scurrility and send them to school
         that they may vent premeditated libels, which we do not call insults, but smart sayings; yet what madness, at one
         time to be amused and at another to be affronted by the same thing, and to call a phrase an outrage when spoken by a
         friend, and an amusing piece of raillery when used by a slave-boy!
         <br>&emsp;In the same spirit in which we deal with boys, the wise man deals with all those whose childhood still
         endures after their youth is past and their hair is grey. What do men profit by age when their mind has all the
         faults of childhood and their defects are intensified by time? When they differ from children only in the size and
         appearance of their bodies, and are just as unsteady and capricious, eager for pleasure without discrimination,
         timorous and quiet through fear rather than through natural disposition? One cannot say that such men differ from
         children because the latter are greedy for knuckle-bones and nuts and coppers, while the former are greedy for gold
         and silver and cities; because the latter play amongst themselves at being magistrates, and imitate the purple-edged
         robe of state, the lictors’ axes, and the judgment-seat, while the former play with the same things in earnest in the
         Campus Martius and the courts of justice; because the latter pile up the sand on the seashore into the likeness of
         houses, and the former, with an air of being engaged in important business, employ themselves in piling up stones and
         walls and roofs until they have turned what was intended for the protection of the body into a danger to it? Children
         and those more advanced in age both make the same mistake, but the latter deal with different and more important
         things; the wise man, therefore, is quite justified in treating the affronts which he receives from such men as
         jokes: and sometimes he corrects them, as he would children, by pain and punishment, not because he has received an
         injury, but because they have done one and in order that they may do so no more. Thus we break in animals with
         stripes, yet we are not angry with them when they refuse to carry their rider, but curb them in order that pain may
         overcome their obstinacy. Now, therefore, you know the answer to the question which was put to us, “Why, if the wise
         man receives neither injury nor insult, he punishes those who do these things?” He does not revenge himself, but
         corrects them.
         <br>&emsp;What, then, is there to prevent your believing this strength of mind to belong to the wise man, when you
         can see the same thing existing in others, though not from the same cause?—for what physician is angry with a crazy
         patient? who takes to heart the curses of a fever-stricken one who is denied cold water? The wise man retains in his
         dealings with all men this same habit of mind which the physician adopts in dealing with his patients, whose parts of
         shame he does not scorn to handle should they need treatment, nor yet to look at their solid and liquid evacuations,
         nor to endure their reproaches when frenzied by disease. The wise man knows that all those who strut about in
         purple-edged togas,[4] healthy and embrowned, are brain-sick people, whom he regards as sick and full of follies. He
         is not, therefore, angry, should they in their sickness presume to bear themselves somewhat impertinently towards
         their physician, and in the same spirit as that in which he sets no value upon their titles of honour, he will set
         but little value upon their acts of disrespect to himself. He will not rise in his own esteem if a beggar pays his
         court to him, and he will not think it an affront if one of the dregs of the people does not return his greeting. So
         also he will not admire himself even if many rich men admire him; for he knows that they differ in no respect from
         beggars—nay, are even more wretched than they; for beggars want but a little, whereas rich men want a great deal.
         Again, he will not be moved if the King of the Medes, or Attalus, King of Asia, passes by him in silence with a
         scornful air when he offers his greeting; for he knows that such a man’s position has nothing to render it more
         enviable than that of the man whose duty it is in some great household to keep the sick and mad servants in order.
         Shall I be put out if one of those who do business at the temple of Castor, buying and selling worthless slaves, does
         not return my salute, a man whose shops are crowded with throngs of the worst of bondmen? I trow not; for what good
         can there be in a man who owns none but bad men? As the wise man is indifferent to the courtesy or incivility of such
         a man, so is he to that of a king. “You own,” says he, “the Parthians and Bactrians, but they are men whom you keep
         in order by fear, they are people whose possession forbids you to unstring the bow, they are fierce enemies, on sale,
         and eagerly looking out for a new master.” He will not, then, be moved by an insult from any man for though all men
         differ one from another, yet the wise man regards them all as alike on account of their equal folly; for should he
         once lower himself to the point of being affected by either injury or insult, he could never feel safe afterwards,
         and safety is the especial advantage of the wise man, and he will not be guilty of showing respect to the man who has
         done him an injury by admitting that he has received one, because it necessarily follows that he who is disquieted at
         any one’s scorn would value that person’s admiration.
         <br>&emsp;Such madness possesses some men that they imagine it possible for an affront to be put upon them by a
         woman. What matters it who she may be, how many slaves bear her litter, how heavily her ears are laden, how soft her
         seat? she is always the same thoughtless creature, and unless she possesses acquired knowledge and much learning, she
         is fierce and passionate in her desires. Some are annoyed at being jostled by a heater of curling-tongs, and call the
         reluctance of a great man’s porter to open the door, the pride of his nomenclator,[5] or the disdainfulness of his
         chamberlain, insults. O! what laughter is to be got out of such things, with what amusement the mind may be filled
         when it contrasts the frantic follies of others with its own peace! “How then? will the wise man not approach doors
         which are kept by a surly porter?” Nay, if any need calls him thither, he will make trial of him, however fierce he
         may be, will tame him as one tames a dog by offering it food, and will not be enraged at having to expend
         entrance-money, reflecting that on certain bridges also one has to pay toll; in like fashion he will pay his fee to
         whoever farms this revenue of letting in visitors, for he knows that men are wont to buy whatever is offered for
         sale.[6] A man shows a poor spirit if he is pleased with himself for having answered the porter cavalierly, broken
         his staff, forced his way into his master’s presence, and demanded a whipping for him. He who strives with a man
         makes himself that man’s rival, and must be on equal terms with him before he can overcome him. But what will the
         wise man do when he receives a cuff? He will do as Cato did when he was struck in the face; he did not flare up and
         revenge the outrage, he did not even pardon it, but ignored it, showing more magnanimity in not acknowledging it than
         if he had forgiven it. We will not dwell long upon this point; for who is there who knows not that none of those
         things which are thought to be good or evil are looked upon by the wise man and by mankind in general in the same
         manner? He does not regard what all men think low or wretched; he does not follow the people’s track, but as the
         stars move in a path opposite to that of the earth, so he proceeds contrary to the prejudices of all.
         <br>&emsp;Cease then to say, “Will not the wise man, then, receive an injury if he be beaten, if his eye be knocked
         out? will he not receive an insult if he be hooted through the Forum by the foul voices of ruffians? if at a court
         banquet he be bidden to leave the table and eat with slaves appointed to degrading duties? if he be forced to endure
         anything else that can be thought of that would gall a high spirit?” However many or however severe these crosses may
         be, they will all be of the same kind; and if small ones do not affect him, neither will greater ones; if a few do
         not affect him, neither will more. It is from your own weakness that you form your idea of his colossal mind, and
         when you have thought how much you yourselves could endure to suffer, you place the limit of the wise man’s endurance
         a little way beyond that. But his virtue has placed him in another region of the universe which has nothing in common
         with you. Seek out sufferings and all things hard to be borne, repulsive to be heard or seen; he will not be
         overwhelmed by their combination, and will bear all just as he bears each one of them. He who says that the wise man
         can bear this and cannot bear that, and restrains his magnanimity within certain limits, does wrong; for Fortune
         overcomes us unless she is entirely overcome. Think not that this is mere Stoic austerity. Epicurus, whom you adopt
         as the patron of your laziness, and who, you imagine, always taught what was soft and slothful and conducive to
         pleasure, said, “Fortune seldom stands in a wise man’s way.” How near he came to a manly sentiment! Do thou dare to
         speak more boldly, and clear her out of the way altogether! This is the house of the wise man—narrow, unadorned,
         without bustle and splendour, the threshold guarded by no porters who marshal the crowd of visitors with a
         haughtiness proportionate to their bribes—but Fortune cannot cross this open and unguarded threshold. She knows that
         there is no room for her where there is nothing of hers.
         <br>&emsp;Now if even Epicurus, who made more concessions to the body than any one, takes a spirited tone with regard
         to injuries, what can appear beyond belief or beyond the scope of human nature amongst us Stoics? He says that
         injuries may be endured by the wise man, we say that they do not exist for him. Nor is there any reason why you
         should declare this to be repugnant to nature. We do not deny that it is an unpleasant thing to be beaten or struck,
         or to lose one of our limbs, but we say that none of these things are injuries. We do not take away from them the
         feeling of pain, but the name of “injury,” which cannot be received while our virtue is unimpaired. We shall see
         which of the two is nearest the truth; each of them agree in despising injury. You ask what difference there is
         between them? All that there is between two very brave gladiators, one of whom conceals his wound and holds his
         ground, while the other turns round to the shouting populace, gives them to understand that his wound is nothing, and
         does not permit them to interfere on his behalf. You need not think that it is any great thing about which we differ;
         the whole gist of the matter, that which alone concerns you, is what both schools of philosophy urge you to do,
         namely, to despise injuries and insults, which I may call the shadows and outlines of injuries, to despise which does
         not need a wise man, but merely a sensible one, who can say to himself, “Do these things befall me deservedly or
         undeservedly? If deservedly, it is not an insult, but a judicial sentence; if undeservedly, then he who does
         injustice ought to blush, not I. And what is this which is called an insult? Someone has made a joke about the
         baldness of my head, the weakness of my eyes, the thinness of my legs, the shortness of my stature; what insult is
         there in telling me that which everyone sees? We laugh when tête-à-tête at the same thing at which we are indignant
         when it is said before a crowd, and we do not allow others the privilege of saying what we ourselves are wont to say
         about ourselves; we are amused at decorous jests, but are angry if they are carried too far.”
         <br>&emsp;Chrysippus says that a man was enraged because someone called him a sea-sheep; we have seen Fidus
         Cornelius, the son-in-law of Ovidius Naso, weeping in the Senate-house because Corbulo called him a plucked ostrich;
         his command of his countenance did not fail him at other abusive charges, which damaged his character and way of
         life; at this ridiculous saying he burst into tears. So deplorable is the weakness of men’s minds when reason no
         longer guides them. What of our taking offence if any one imitates our talk, our walk, or apes any defect of our
         person or our pronunciation? as if they would become more notorious by another’s imitation than by our doing them
         ourselves. Some are unwilling to hear about their age and grey hairs, and all the rest of what men pray to arrive at.
         The reproach of poverty agonizes some men, and whoever conceals it makes it a reproach to himself; and therefore if
         you of your own accord are the first to acknowledge it, you cut the ground from under the feet of those who would
         sneer and politely insult you; no one is laughed at who begins by laughing at himself. Tradition tells us that
         Vatinius, a man born both to be laughed at and hated, was a witty and clever jester. He made many jokes about his
         feet and his short neck, and thus escaped the sarcasms of Cicero above all, and of his other enemies, of whom he had
         more than he had diseases. If he, who through constant abuse had forgotten how to blush, could do this by sheer
         brazenness, why should not he who has made some progress in the education of a gentleman and the study of philosophy?
         Besides, it is a sort of revenge to spoil a man’s enjoyment of the insult he has offered to us; such men say, “Dear
         me, I suppose he did not understand it.” Thus the success of an insult lies in the sensitiveness and rage of the
         victim; hereafter the insulter will sometimes meet his match; someone will be found to revenge you also.
         <br>&emsp;Gaius Caesar, among the other vices with which he overflowed, was possessed by a strange insolent passion
         for marking every one with some note of ridicule, he himself being the most tempting subject for derision; so ugly
         was the paleness which proved him mad, so savage the glare of the eyes which lurked under his old woman’s brow, so
         hideous his misshapen head, bald and dotted about with a few cherished hairs; besides the neck set thick with
         bristles, his thin legs, his monstrous feet. It would be endless were I to mention all the insults which he heaped
         upon his parents and ancestors, and people of every class of life. I will mention those which brought him to ruin. An
         especial friend of his was Asiaticus Valerius, a proud-spirited man and one hardly likely to put up with another’s
         insults quietly. At a drinking bout, that is, a public assembly, Gaius, at the top of his voice, reproached this man
         with the way his wife behaved in bed. Good gods! that a man should hear that the emperor knew this, and that he, the
         emperor, should describe his adultery and his disappointment to the lady’s husband, I do not say to a man of consular
         rank and his own friend. Chaerea, on the other hand, the military tribune, had a voice not befitting his prowess,
         feeble in sound, and somewhat suspicious unless you knew his achievements. When he asked for the watchword Gaius at
         one time gave him “Venus,” and at another “Priapus,” and by various means reproached the man-at-arms with effeminate
         vice; while he himself was dressed in transparent clothes, wearing sandals and jewellery. Thus he forced him to use
         his sword, that he might not have to ask for the watchword oftener; it was Chaerea who first of all the conspirators
         raised his hand, who cut through the middle of Caligula’s neck with one blow. After that, many swords, belonging to
         men who had public or private injuries to avenge, were thrust into his body, but he first showed himself a man who
         seemed least like one. The same Gaius construed everything as an insult (since those who are most eager to offer
         affronts are least able to endure them). He was angry with Herennius Macer for having greeted him as Gaius—nor did
         the chief centurion of triarii get off scot-free for having saluted him as Caligula; having been born in the camp and
         brought up as the child of the legions, he had been wont to be called by this name, nor was there any by which he was
         better known to the troops, but by this time he held “Caligula” to be a reproach and a dishonour. Let wounded
         spirits, then, console themselves with this reflexion, that, even though our easy temper may have neglected to
         revenge itself, nevertheless that there will be someone who will punish the impertinent, proud, and insulting man,
         for these are vices which he never confines to one victim or one single offensive act. Let us look at the examples of
         those men whose endurance we admire, as, for instance, that of Socrates, who took in good part the published and
         acted jibes of the comedians upon himself, and laughed no less than he did when he was drenched with dirty water by
         his wife Xanthippe. Antisthenes was reproached with his mother being a barbarian and a Thracian; he answered that the
         mother of the gods, too, came from Mount Ida.
         <br>&emsp;We ought not to engage in quarrels and wrangling; we ought to betake ourselves far away and to disregard
         everything of this kind which thoughtless people do (indeed thoughtless people alone do it), and to set equal value
         upon the honours and the reproaches of the mob; we ought not to be hurt by the one or to be pleased by the other.
         Otherwise we shall neglect many essential points, shall desert our duty both to the state and in private life through
         excessive fear of insults or weariness of them, and sometimes we shall even miss what would do us good, while
         tortured by this womanish pain at hearing something not to our mind. Sometimes, too, when enraged with powerful men
         we shall expose this failing by our reckless freedom of speech; yet it is not freedom to suffer nothing—we are
         mistaken—freedom consists in raising one’s mind superior to injuries and becoming a person whose pleasures come from
         himself alone, in separating oneself from external circumstances that one may not have to lead a disturbed life in
         fear of the laughter and tongues of all men; for if any man can offer an insult, who is there who cannot? The wise
         man and the would-be wise man will apply different remedies to this; for it is only those whose philosophical
         education is incomplete, and who still guide themselves by public opinion, who would suppose that they ought to spend
         their lives in the midst of insults and injuries; yet all things happen in a more endurable fashion to men who are
         prepared for them. The nobler a man is by birth, by reputation, or by inheritance, the more bravely he should bear
         himself, remembering that the tallest men stand in the front rank in battle. As for insults, offensive language,
         marks of disgrace, and such-like disfigurements, he ought to bear them as he would bear the shouts of the enemy, and
         darts or stones flung from a distance, which rattle upon his helmet without causing a wound; while he should look
         upon injuries as wounds, some received on his armour and others on his body, which he endures without falling or even
         leaving his place in the ranks. Even though you be hard pressed and violently attacked by the enemy, still it is base
         to give way; hold the post assigned to you by nature. You ask, what this post is? it is that of being a man. The wise
         man has another help, of the opposite kind to this; you are hard at work, while he has already won the victory. Do
         not quarrel with your own good advantage, and, until you shall have made your way to the truth, keep alive this hope
         in your minds, be willing to receive the news of a better life, and encourage it by your admiration and your prayers;
         it is to the interest of the commonwealth of mankind that there should be someone who is unconquered, someone against
         whom fortune has no power.

      <div class="content-text hidden" id="Tranquillity">
         SERENUS:
         <br>&emsp;When I looked into myself, Seneca, some of my vices appeared clearly on the surface, so that I could lay my
         hand on them; some were more hidden away in the depths; some were not there all the time but return at intervals.
         These last I would say are the most troublesome: they are like prowling enemies who pounce on you when occasion
         offers, and allow you neither to be at the ready as in war nor at ease as in peace. However, the state I most find
         myself in (for why should I not admit the truth to you as to a doctor?) is that I am not really free of the vices
         which I feared and hated, though not, on the other hand, subject to them: this puts me in a condition which is not
         the worst, but an extremely peevish and quarrelsome one -1 am neither ill nor well. There is no need for you to say
         that all virtues are fragile to start with and acquire firmness and strength with time. I know too that those which
         toil to make a good impression, seeking high rank, for example, and a reputation for eloquence, and whatever depends
         on the approval of others, take time to mature - both those which offer real strength and those which are tricked out
         in some sort of dye aimed at popularity have to wait years until the passage of time gradually produces their colour.
         But I’m afraid that habit, which induces firmness in things, may drive this fault more deeply into me: long
         association brings love of evil as well as good.
         <br>&emsp;I cannot show all at once so much as bit by bit the nature of this mental weakness, which wavers between
         two choices and does not incline strongly either to right or to wrong: I’ll tell you what happens to me and you can
         find a name for the malady. I have a tremendous love of frugality, I must admit. I don’t like a couch decked out
         ostentatiously; or clothes brought out from a chest or given a sheen by the forceful pressure of weights and a
         thousand mangles, but homely and inexpensive, and not hoarded to be donned with fuss and bother. I like food which is
         not prepared and watched over by the household slaves, not ordered many days in advance nor served by a multitude of
         hands, but readily obtainable and easy to deal with, nothing in it out of the way or expensive, available everywhere,
         not heavy on the purse or the body, and not destined to come back by the same way it entered. I want my servant to be
         an ordinary, unskilled, home-born slave; my silver to be the heavy ware of my rustic father without any hallmark; and
         my table to be without flashy variegated markings and not familiar to the whole town through its many changes of
         fashionable owners, but set up to be used and not to distract any guest’s eyes with pleasure or kindle them with
         envy. But when I have set up these standards I find my mind dazzled by the fine trappings of some training-school for
         servants, with the slaves more carefully clothed and decked with gold than if they were in
         <br>&emsp;a public parade, and a whole army of glittering flunkies; by a house where you even walk on precious
         stones, where wealth is scattered in every corner, where the roof itself glitters, and the whole populace
         deferentially attends the ruin of a family heritage. Need I mention pools clear to their depths which flow around the
         dinner guests, or banquets worthy of their surroundings? After being long given up to frugality I have found myself
         surrounded by the lavish splendour of luxury echoing all about me. My vision wavers somewhat, for I can raise my mind
         to face it more easily than my eyes. And so I come back not a worse but a sadder man; I don’t move with my head so
         high among my trivial possessions; and a secret gnawing doubt undermines me whether that life is superior. None of
         these things is changing me, but none of them fails to shake me.
         <br>&emsp;I decide to follow my teacher’s precepts and busy myself in state affairs; I decide to achieve public
         office -not, of course, because of the purple robe and the lictors’ rods, but so that I can be more ready with help
         for my friends and relations, for all my fellow-citizens, and then for all mankind. Enthusiastically I follow Zeno,
         Cleanthes, Chrysippus, of whom, by the way, none entered public life and all urged others to do so. But when
         something has assailed my mind, which is not used to being battered; when something has happened which either is
         unworthy of me (a common experience in every human life) or cannot easily be dealt with; when unimportant things
         become time-consuming; I take refuge in leisure and, just like weary flocks of animals, I make my way more quickly
         home. I decide to restrict my life within its walls, saying, ‘Let no one rob me of a single day who is not going to
         make me an adequate return for such a loss. Let my mind be fixed on itself, cultivate itself, have no external
         interest -nothing that seeks the approval of another; let it cherish the tranquillity that has no part in public or
         private concerns.’ But when my mind is excited by reading a convincing account of something and spurred on by noble
         examples, I long to rush into the forum, to speak on behalf of one man and offer help to another, which will at least
         be an attempt to assist even if it does not succeed, or to curb the pride of someone else grown arrogant by success.
         <br>&emsp;In my studies I suppose it must indeed be better to keep my theme firmly in view and speak to this, while
         allowing the theme to suggest my words and so dictate the course of an unstudied style of speech. ‘Where is the
         need,’ I ask, ‘to compose something to last for ages? Why not stop trying to prevent posterity being silent about
         you? You were born to die, and a silent funeral is less bothersome. So if you must fill your time, write something in
         a simple style for your own use and not for publication: less toil is needed if you study only for the day.’ Again,
         when my mind is lifted up by the greatness of its thoughts, it becomes ambitious for words and longs to match its
         higher inspiration with its language, and so produces a style that conforms to the impressiveness of the subject
         matter. Then it is that I forget my rule and principle of restraint, and I am carried too far aloft by a voice no
         longer my own.
         <br>&emsp;To cut the matter short, this weakness in my good intentions pursues me in every sphere. I fear that I am
         gradually getting worse, or (which is more worrying) that I am hanging on an edge like someone always on the point of
         falling, and that perhaps there is more wrong than I myself can see: for we take too intimate a view of our own
         characteristics and bias always affects our judgement. I imagine many people could have achieved wisdom if they had
         not imagined they had already achieved it, if they had not dissembled about some of their own characteristics and
         turned a blind eye to others. For you have no reason to suppose that we come to grief more through the flattery of
         others than through our own. Who has dared to tell himself the truth? Who even when surrounded by crowds of toadying
         sycophants is not his own greatest flatterer? So, I am appealing to you, if you have any cure for this vacillation of
         mind, to consider me worthy of owing tranquillity to you. I realize that these mental agitations of mine are not
         dangerous and won’t produce a storm. To express my complaint for you in a realistic metaphor, I am harried not by a
         tempest but by sea-sickness. Whatever my ailment, then, root it out and come to the help of one who is struggling in
         sight of land.
         <br>
         SENECA:
         <br>&emsp;
         Indeed, Serenus, I have long been silently asking myself to what I should compare such a mental state, and I could
         find no closer analogy than the condition of those people who have got over a long and serious illness, but are still
         sometimes mildly affected by onsets of fever and pain, and even when free of the last symptoms are still worried and
         upset; and, though quite better, offer their hands to doctors and needlessly complain if they feel at all hot. With
         these people, Serenus, it is not that their bodies are insufficiently healed but that they are insufficiently used to
         health, just as even a calm sea will show some ripples, especially when it has subsided following a storm. So what
         you need is not those more radical remedies which we have now finished with - blocking yourself here, being angry
         with yourself there, threatening yourself sternly somewhere else -but the final treatment, confidence in yourself and
         the belief that you are on the right path, and not led astray by the many tracks which cross yours of people who are
         hopelessly lost, though some are wandering not far from the true path. But what you are longing for is great and
         supreme and nearly divine - not to be shaken. The Greeks call this steady firmness of mind ‘euthymia’ (Democritus
         wrote a good treatise about it), but I call it tranquillity, as there is no need to imitate and reproduce the form of
         Greek words: the point at issue must be indicated by some term which should have the sense but not the form of the
         Greek name. We are, therefore, seeking how the mind can follow a smooth and steady course, well disposed to itself,
         happily regarding its own condition and with no interruption to this pleasure, but remaining in a state of peace with
         no ups and downs: that will be tranquillity. Let us consider in general how this can be achieved: you will then
         extract what you like from the communal remedy. Meanwhile the whole failing must be dragged out into the open, where
         everyone will recognize his own share in it. At the same time you will realize how much less trouble you have with
         your self-revulsion than those people who, tied to some specious declaration and labouring under an impressive title,
         are stuck with their own pretence more by shame than by desire.
         <br>&emsp;They are all in the same category, both those who are afflicted with fickleness, boredom and a ceaseless
         change of purpose, and who always yearn for what they have left behind, and those who just yawn from apathy. There
         are those too who toss around like insomniacs, and keep changing their position until they find rest through sheer
         weariness. They keep altering the condition of their lives, and eventually stick to that one in which they are
         trapped not by weariness with further change but by old age which is too sluggish for novelty. There are those too
         who suffer not from moral steadfastness but from inertia, and so lack the fickleness to live as they wish, and just
         live as they have begun. In fact there are innumerable characteristics of the malady, but one effect -dissatisfaction
         with oneself. This arises from mental instability and from fearful and unfulfilled desires, when men do not dare or
         do not achieve all they long for, and all they grasp at is hope: they are always unbalanced and fickle, an inevitable
         consequence of living in suspense. They struggle to gain their prayers by every path, and they teach and force
         themselves to do dishonourable and difficult things; and when their efforts are unrewarded the fruitless disgrace
         tortures them, and they regret not the wickedness but the frustration of their desires. Then they are gripped by
         repentance for their attempt and fear of trying again, and they are undermined by the restlessness of a mind that can
         discover no outlet, because they can neither control nor obey their desires, by the dithering of a life that cannot
         see its way ahead, and by the lethargy of a soul stagnating amid its abandoned hopes. All these afflictions are worse
         when, through hatred of their toilsome failure, men have retreated into idleness and private studies which are
         unbearable to a mind aspiring to public service, keen on activity, and restless by nature because of course it is
         short of inner resources. In consequence, when the pleasures have been removed which busy people derive from their
         actual activities, the mind cannot endure the house, the solitude, the walls, and hates to observe its own isolation.
         From this arises that boredom and self-dissatisfaction, that turmoil of a restless mind and gloomy and grudging
         endurance of our leisure, especially when we are ashamed to admit the reasons for it and our sense of shame drives
         the agony inward, and our desires are trapped in narrow bounds without escape and stifle themselves. From this arise
         melancholy and mourning and a thousand vacillations of a wavering mind, buoyed up by the birth of hope and sickened
         by the death of it. From this arises the state of mind of those who loathe their own leisure and complain that they
         have nothing to do, and the bitterest envy at the promotion of others. For unproductive idleness nurtures malice, and
         because they themselves could not prosper they want everyone else to be ruined. Then from this dislike of others’
         success and despair of their own, their minds become enraged against fortune, complain about the times, retreat into
         obscurity, and brood over their own sufferings until they become sick and tired of themselves. For the human mind is
         naturally mobile and enjoys activity. Every chance of stimulation and distraction is welcome to it -even more welcome
         to all those inferior characters who actually enjoy being worn out by busy activity. There are certain bodily sores
         which welcome the hands that will hurt them, and long to be touched, and a foul itch loves to be scratched: in the
         same way I would say that those minds on which desires have broken out like horrid sores take delight in toil and
         aggravation. For some things delight our bodies even when they cause some pain, like turning over to change a side
         that is not yet tired and repeatedly shifting to keep cool: so Achilles in Homer lay now on his face, now on his
         back, trying to settle in different positions, and like an invalid could endure nothing for long but used his
         restlessness as a cure. Hence men travel far and wide, wandering along foreign shores and making trial by land and
         sea of their restlessness, which always hates what is around it. ‘Let’s now go to Campania.’ Then when they get bored
         with luxury - ‘Let’s visit uncultivated areas; let’s explore the woodlands of Bruttium and Lucania.’ And yet amid the
         wilds some delight is missing by which their pampered eyes can find relief from the tedious squalor of these
         unsightly regions. ‘Let’s go to Tarentum, with its celebrated harbour and mild winters, an area prosperous enough for
         a large population even in antiquity.’ ‘Let’s now make our way to the city’ - too long have their ears missed the din
         of applause: now they long to enjoy even the sight of human blood. They make one journey after another and change
         spectacle for spectacle. As Lucretius says, ‘Thus each man ever flees himself.’ But to what end, if he does not
         escape himself? He pursues and dogs himself as his own most tedious companion. And so we must realize that our
         difficulty is not the fault of the places but of ourselves. We are weak in enduring anything, and cannot put up with
         toil or pleasure or ourselves or anything for long. This weakness has driven some men to their deaths; because by
         frequently changing their aims they kept falling back on the same things and had left themselves no room for novelty.
         They began to be sick of life and the world itself, and out of their enervating self-indulgence arose the feeling
         ‘How long must I face the same things?’
         <br>&emsp;You want to know what remedy I can recommend against this boredom. The best course, as Athenodorus says,
         would be to busy oneself in the practical activity of political involvement and civic duties. For just as some people
         spend the day in sun-bathing, exercise and the care of their bodies, and for athletes it is of the highest practical
         importance to spend most of their time cultivating the strength of their limbs, to which alone they have devoted
         themselves, so for you, who are training your mind for the contests of public life, by far the finest approach is
         regular practice. For when one intends to make himself useful to his fellow-citizens and fellow men, he is at the
         same time getting practice and doing good if he throws himself heart and soul into the duty of looking after both the
         community and the individual. ‘But,’ says Athenodorus, ‘since mankind is so insanely ambitious and so many false
         accusers twist right into wrong, making honesty unsafe and bound to meet resistance rather than help, we should
         indeed retire from public and political life, though a great mind has scope for free activity even in private life.
         The energies of lions and other animals are restricted by cages, but not of men, whose finest achievements are seen
         in retirement. However, let a man seclude himself on condition that, wherever he conceals his leisure, he is prepared
         to serve both individuals and all mankind by his intellect, his words and his counsel. Service to the state is not
         restricted to the man who produces candidates for office, defends people in court, and votes for peace and war: the
         man who teaches the young, who instils virtue into their minds (and we have a great shortage of good teachers), who
         grips and restrains those who are rushing madly after wealth and luxury, and if nothing more at least delays them -
         he too is doing a public service, though in private life. Do you imagine that more benefit is provided by the
         praetors, who settle cases between foreigners and citizens by pronouncing to appellants the verdict of the assessor,
         than by those who pronounce on the nature of justice, piety, endurance, bravery, contempt of death, knowledge of the
         gods, and how free a blessing is that of a good conscience? So if you devote to your studies the time you have taken
         from your public duties you will not have deserted or evaded your task. For the soldier is not only the man who
         stands in the battle line, defending the right and left wings, but also the one who guards the gates and has the
         post, less dangerous but not idle, of keeping the watch and guarding the armoury: these duties, though bloodless,
         count as military service. If you apply yourself to study you will avoid all boredom with life, you will not long for
         night because you are sick of daylight, you will be neither a burden to yourself nor useless to others, you will
         attract many to become your friends and the finest people will flock about you. For even obscure virtue is never
         concealed but gives visible evidence of herself: anyone worthy of her will follow her tracks. But if we shun all
         society and, abandoning the human race, live for ourselves alone, this isolation, devoid of any interest, will be
         followed by a dearth of worthwhile activity. We shall begin to put up some buildings, to pull down others, to push
         back the sea, to draw waters through unnatural channels, and to squander the time which nature gave us to be used.
         Some of us use it sparingly, others wastefully; some spend it so that we can give an account of it, others so that we
         have no balance left - a most shameful result. Often a very old man has no other proof of his long life than his
         age.’
         <br>&emsp;It seems to me, my dear Serenus, that Athenodorus has too easily submitted to the times and too quickly
         retreated. I would not deny that one has to yield sometimes - but by a gradual retreat, and holding on to our
         standards and our soldier’s honour. Those who are still armed when they agree terms with their enemies are safer and
         more highly regarded. This, I think, is what Virtue and Virtue’s disciple should do: if Fortune gets the better of
         someone and deprives him of the means of action, he should not immediately turn his back and bolt, dropping his
         weapons and looking for a place to hide (as if there were any place where Fortune could not find him), but he should
         apply himself more sparingly to his duties and choose something carefully in which he can serve the state. Suppose he
         cannot be a soldier: let him seek public office. Suppose he has to live in a private capacity: let him be an
         advocate. Suppose he is condemned to silence: let him help his fellow-citizens by unspoken support. Suppose it is
         dangerous for him to be seen in the forum: in private homes, at the shows, at banquets let him play the part of a
         good companion, a loyal friend, a temperate banqueter. Suppose he has lost the duties of a citizen: let him practise
         those of a man. With a lofty spirit we have refused to confine ourselves within the walls of one city, and we have
         gone out to have dealings with the whole earth and claimed the world as our country, for this reason, that we might
         give our virtue a wider field for action. Suppose you are cut off from judicial office, and public speaking and
         elections are closed to you: consider all the extensive regions that lie open behind you, all the peoples - you will
         never find an area barred to you so large that an even larger one is not left open. But take care that this is not
         entirely your fault - for example, that you don’t want to take public office except as consul or prytanis or herald
         or sufes. But suppose you didn’t want to serve in the army except as general or tribune? Even if others hold the
         front line and your lot has put you in the third rank, you must play the soldier there with your voice, your
         encouragement, your example and your spirit. Even if a man’s hands are cut off, he finds he can yet serve his side by
         standing firm and cheering them on. You should do something like that: if Fortune has removed you from a leading role
         in public life you should still stand firm and cheer others on, and if someone grips your throat, still stand firm
         and help though silent. The service of a good citizen is never useless: being heard and seen, he helps by his
         expression, a nod of his head, a stubborn silence, even his gait. Just as certain wholesome substances do us good by
         their odour even without tasting or touching them, so Virtue spreads her advantages even from a distant hiding place.
         Whether she walks abroad about her legitimate business, or appears on sufferance and is forced to furl her sails,
         whether she is confined, inactive and dumb, within a narrow space, or fully visible, in any condition at all she does
         good service. Why do you think that a man living in honourable retirement cannot offer a valuable example? Much the
         best course, therefore, is to combine leisure with some activity whenever a fully energetic life is impossible owing
         to the hindrances of chance or the state of the country; for you will never find absolutely every road blocked to
         some form of honourable activity.
         <br>&emsp;Can you find a more wretched city than Athens when she was being torn apart by the Thirty Tyrants? Having
         killed thirteen hundred of the best citizens, they did not stop at that, but their very savagery spurred itself on.
         In a city which contained the Areopagus, a law court of the highest sanctity, and a senate and a popular assembly
         resembling a senate, there met daily a sinister group of executioners, and the unfortunate senate house was crowded
         with tyrants. Could that state be at peace where there were as many tyrants as attendants? There could not even be a
         hope of recovering their liberty nor any obvious chance of retaliation against such powerful villains: for where
         could the poor country find enough men like Harmodius? Yet Socrates was in the thick of it: he comforted the gloomy
         city fathers, encouraged those who were despairing of the state, reproached the rich who now feared their own wealth
         for a tardy repentance of their dangerous greed; and to those willing to imitate him he was a walking inspiration, as
         he moved about, a free spirit among thirty masters. Yet this was the man that Athens herself put to death in prison,
         and Freedom could not bear the freedom of the man who had openly scoffed at a whole troop of tyrants. So you can
         understand both that in a state suffering disaster the wise man has the opportunity to show an influential presence,
         and that in a successful and prosperous state money- grubbing, envy and a thousand other unmanly vices reign supreme.
         Therefore, according to the disposition of the state and the liberty Fortune allows us, we shall either extend or
         contract our activities; but at all events we shall stir ourselves and not be gripped and paralysed by fear. He
         indeed will prove a man who, threatened by dangers on all sides, with arms and chains clattering around him, will
         neither endanger nor conceal his courage: for self-preservation does not entail suppressing onself. Truly, I believe,
         Curius Dentatus used to say that he preferred real death to living death; for the ultimate horror is to leave the
         number of the living before you die. But if you happen to live at a time when public life is hard to cope with, you
         will just have to claim more time for leisure and literary work, seek a safe harbour from time to time as if you were
         on a dangerous voyage, and not wait for public life to dismiss you but voluntarily release yourself from it first.
         <br>&emsp;However, we must take a careful look first at ourselves, then at the activities which we shall be
         attempting, and then at those for whose sake and with whom we are attempting them.
         <br>&emsp;Above all it is essential to appraise oneself, because we usually overestimate our capabilities. One man
         comes to grief through trusting his eloquence; another makes more demands on his fortune than it can stand; another
         taxes his frail body with laborious work. Some men are too shy for politics, which require a bold appearance; some
         through brashness are not fitted for court life; some cannot restrain their anger and any feeling of annoyance drives
         them to reckless language; some cannot control their wit and refrain from smart but danger- ous sallies. For all of
         these retirement is more expedient than public activity: a passionate and impatient nature must avoid provocations to
         outspokenness that will cause trouble.
         <br>&emsp;Then we must appraise the actual things we are attempting and match our strength to what we are going to
         undertake. For the performer must always be stronger than his task: loads that are too heavy for the bearer are bound
         to overwhelm him. Moreover, certain tasks are not so much great as prolific in producing many other tasks: we must
         avoid those which give birth in turn to new and manifold activities, and not approach something from which we cannot
         easily withdraw. You must set your hands to tasks which you can finish or at least hope to finish, and avoid those
         which get bigger as you proceed and do not cease where you had intended.
         <br>&emsp;We must be especially careful in choosing people, and deciding whether they are worth devoting a part of
         our lives to them, whether the sacrifice of our time makes a difference to them. For some people actually charge us
         for our services to them. Athenodorus says he would not even go to dinner with a man who did not thereby feel
         indebted to him. I suppose you realize how much less inclined he was to visit those who repay their friends’ services
         with a meal, and count the courses as largesses, as if they were overdoing the honour paid to another. Take away
         their witnesses and spectators and there is no fun in private gormandizing.
         <br>&emsp;You must consider whether your nature is more suited to practical activity or to quiet study and
         reflection, and incline in the direction your natural faculty and disposition take you. Isocrates forcibly pulled
         Ephorus away from the forum, thinking he would be better employed in writing history. Inborn dispositions do not
         respond well to compulsion, and we labour in vain against nature’s opposition.
         <br>&emsp;But nothing delights the mind so much as fond and loyal friendship. What a blessing it is to have hearts
         that are ready and willing to receive all your secrets in safety, with whom you are less afraid to share knowledge of
         something than keep it to yourself, whose conversation soothes your distress, whose advice helps you make up your
         mind, whose cheerfulness dissolves your sorrow, whose very appearance cheers you up! To be sure, we shall choose
         those who are as far as possible free from strong desires; for vices spread insidiously, and those nearest to hand
         are assailed and damaged by contact with them. It follows that, just as at a time of an epidemic disease we must take
         care not to sit beside people whose bodies are infected with feverish disease because we shall risk ourselves and
         suffer from their breathing upon us, so in choosing our friends for their characters we shall take care to find those
         who are the least corrupted: mixing the sound with the sick is how disease starts. But I am not enjoining upon you to
         follow and associate with none but a wise man. For where will you find him whom we have been seeking for ages? In
         place of the ideal we must put up with the least bad. You would scarcely have the opportunity of a happier choice if
         you were hunting for good men among the Platos and Xenophons and all that offspring of the Socratic breed; or if you
         had access to the age of Cato, which produced many men worthy to be born in Cato’s time. (It also produced many who
         were worse than at any other time and who committed appalling crimes: for both groups were necessary for Cato to be
         appreciated - he needed the good to win their approval and the bad to prove his strength.) But in the current dearth
         of good men you must be less particular in your choice. Still, you must especially avoid those who are gloomy and
         always lamenting, and who grasp at every pretext for complaint. Though a man’s loyalty and kindness may not be in
         doubt, a companion who is agitated and groaning about everything is an enemy to peace of mind.
         <br>&emsp;Let us turn to private possessions, the greatest source of human misery. For if you compare all the other
         things from which we suffer, deaths, illnesses, fears, desires, endurance of pains and toils, with the evils which
         money brings us, the latter will far outweigh the others. So we must bear in mind how much lighter is the pain of not
         having money than of losing it; and we shall realize that the less poverty has to lose the less agony it can cause
         us. For you are mistaken if you think that rich people suffer with more fortitude: the pain of a wound is the same in
         the largest and the smallest bodies. Bion aptly remarks that plucking out hair hurts bald people just as much as
         those with hair. You can make the same point that rich and poor suffer equal distress: for both groups cling to their
         money and suffer if it is torn away from them. But, as I said, it is easier to bear and simpler not to acquire than
         to lose, so you will notice that those people are more cheerful whom Fortune has never favoured than those whom she
         has deserted. That great- souled man Diogenes realized this, and arranged that nothing could be taken from him. You
         can call this state poverty, deprivation, need, and give this freedom from care any shameful name you like: I shall
         not count this man happy if you can find me another who has nothing to lose. If I am not mistaken it is a royal
         position among all the misers, the cheats, the robbers, the kidnappers, to be the only one who cannot be harmed. If
         anyone has any doubts about Diogenes’ felicity he can also have doubts about the condition of the immortal gods -
         whether they are living unhappily because they have no estates and parks and costly farms let out to foreign tenants
         and vast receipts of interest in the forum. Are you not ashamed of yourselves, all of you who are smitten by wealth?
         Come, look at the heavens: you will see the gods devoid of possessions, and giving everything though they have
         nothing. Do you think a man who has stripped himself of all the gifts of chance is poor, or that he resembles the
         immortal gods? Demetrius, Pompey’s freedman, was not ashamed to be richer than Pompey: would you say he was thereby
         happier? He used to keep the tally of his slaves daily like a general reviewing his army, where previously he would
         have thought it riches to have two under-slaves and a roomier cell. Yet when Diogenes was told that his only slave
         had run away, he did not think it worth the trouble to get him back. ‘It would be degrading,’ he said, ‘if Manes can
         live without Diogenes and not Diogenes without Manes.’ I think what he meant was: ‘Mind your own business, Fortune:
         Diogenes has nothing of yours now. My slave has run away - no, it is I who have got away free.’ A household of slaves
         needs clothing and food; so many bellies of ravenous creatures must be looked after, garments bought, thieving hands
         guarded against, and services employed in the face of tears and curses. How much happier is the man who owes nothing
         to anybody except the one he can most easily refuse, himself! But since we have not such strength of will, we must at
         least curtail our possessions, so we may be less exposed to the blows of Fortune. Men’s bodies are better fitted for
         warfare if they can be compressed into their armour than if they bulge out of it and by their very bulk are exposed
         on every side to wounds. So the ideal amount of money is that which neither falls within the range of poverty nor far
         exceeds it.
         <br>&emsp;Moreover, we shall be satisfied with this limit if we previously practised thrift, without which no amount
         of wealth is enough, and no amount is not ample enough; especially as a remedy is to hand and poverty can itself turn
         to riches by practising economy. Let us get used to banishing ostentation, and to measuring things by their qualities
         of function rather than display. Let food banish hunger and drink banish thirst; let sex indulge its needs; let us
         learn to rely on our limbs, and to adjust our style of dress and our way of living not to the newfangled patterns but
         to the customs of our ancestors. Let us learn to increase our self-restraint, to curb luxury, to moderate ambition,
         to soften anger, to regard poverty without prejudice, to practise frugality, even if many are ashamed of it, to apply
         to nature’s needs the remedies that are cheaply available, to curb as if in fetters unbridled hopes and a mind
         obsessed with the future, and to aim to acquire our riches from ourselves rather than from Fortune. It is not
         possible that all the manifold and unfair disasters of life can be so repelled that many storm winds will not still
         assail those who spread their sails ambitiously. We must restrict our activities so that Fortune’s weapons miss their
         mark; and for that reason exiles and calamities have proved to benefit us and greater disasters have been mended by
         lesser ones. When the mind is less amenable to instruction and cannot be cured by milder means, why should it not be
         helped by having a dose of poverty and disgrace and general ruin - dealing with evil by evil? So let us get used to
         dining without a mass of people, to being slave to fewer slaves, to acquiring clothes for their proper purpose, and
         to living in more restricted quarters. Not only in running and the contests of the Circus, but in this race course of
         our lives we must keep to the inner track.
         <br>&emsp;Even in our studies, where expenditure is most worth while, its justification depends on its moderation.
         What is the point of having countless books and libraries whose titles the owner could scarcely read through in his
         whole lifetime? The mass of books burdens the student without instructing him, and it is far better to devote
         yourself to a few authors than to get lost among many. Forty thousand books were burned in the library at Alexandria.
         Someone else can praise it as a sumptuous monument to royal wealth, like Titus Livius, who calls it a notable
         achievement of the good taste and devotion of kings. That was not good taste or devotion but scholarly self-
         indulgence - in fact, not even scholarly, since they had collected the books not for scholarship but for display. In
         the same way you will find that many people who lack even elementary culture keep books not as tools of learning but
         as decoration for their dining-rooms. So we should buy enough books for use, and none just for embellishment. ‘But
         this,’ you say, ‘is a more honourable expense than squandering money on Corinthian bronzes and on pictures.’ But
         excess in any sphere is reprehensible. How can you excuse a man who collects bookcases of citron-wood and ivory,
         amasses the works of unknown or third-rate authors, and then sits yawning among all his thousands of books and gets
         most enjoyment out of the appearance of his volumes and their labels? Thus you will see that the idlest men possess
         sets of orations and histories, with crates piled up to the ceiling: for nowadays an elegant library too has joined
         hot and cold baths as an essential adornment for a house. I would certainly excuse people for erring through an
         excessive love of study; but these collections of works of inspired genius, along with their several portraits, are
         acquired only for pretentious wall decoration.
         <br>&emsp;But perhaps you have become involved in some difficult situation in life in which either public or private
         circumstances have fastened a noose on you unawares, which you can neither loosen nor snap. You must reflect that
         fettered prisoners only at first feel the weight of the shackles on their legs: in time, when they have decided not
         to struggle against but to bear them, they learn from necessity to endure with fortitude, and from habit to endure
         with ease. In any situation in life you will find delights and relaxations and pleasures if you are prepared to make
         light of your troubles and not let them distress you. In no respect has nature put us more in her debt, since,
         knowing to what sorrows we were born, she contrived habit to soothe our disasters, and so quickly makes us grow used
         to the worst ills. No one could endure lasting adversity if it continued to have the same force as when it first hit
         us. We are all tied to Fortune, some by a loose and golden chain, and others by a tight one of baser metal: but what
         does it matter? We are all held in the same captivity, and those who have bound others are themselves in bonds -
         unless you think perhaps that the left-hand chain is lighter. One man is bound by high office, another by wealth;
         good birth weighs down some, and a humble origin others; some bow under the rule of other men and some under their
         own; some are restricted to one place by exile, others by priesthoods: all life is a servitude. So you have to get
         used to your circumstances, complain about them as little as possible, and grasp whatever advantage they have to
         offer: no condition is so bitter that a stable mind cannot find some consolation in it. Often small areas can be
         skilfully divided up to allow room for many uses and arrangement can make a narrow piece of ground inhabitable. Think
         your way through difficulties: harsh conditions can be softened, restricted ones can be widened, and heavy ones can
         weigh less on those who know how to bear them. Moreover, we must not send our desires on a distant hunt, but allow
         them to explore what is near to hand, since they do not submit to being totally confined. Abandoning those things
         which are impossible or difficult to attain, let us pursue what is readily available and entices our hopes, yet
         recognize that all are equally trivial, outwardly varied in appearance but uniformly futile within. And let us not
         envy those who stand higher than we do: what look like towering heights are precipices. On the other hand, those whom
         an unfair fate has put in a critical condition will be safer for lowering their pride in things that are in
         themselves proud and reducing their fortune as far as they can to a humble level. Indeed there are many who are
         forced to cling to their pinnacle because they cannot descend without falling; but they must bear witness that this
         in itself is their greatest burden, that they are forced to be a burden to others, and that they are not so much
         elevated as impaled. By justice, gentleness, kindness and lavish generosity let them prepare many defences against
         later disasters to give them hope of hanging on more safely. But nothing can rescue us from these mental vacillations
         so efficiently as always to set some limit to advancements, and not to allow Fortune the decision when they should
         cease but ourselves to stop far short of that. In this way we shall have some desires to stimulate the mind, but
         being limited they will not lead us to a state of uncontrolled uncertainty.
         <br>&emsp;What I am saying applies to people who are imperfect, commonplace and unsound, not to the wise man. He does
         not have to walk nervously or cautiously, for he has such self-confidence that he does not hesitate to make a stand
         against Fortune and will never give ground to her. He has no reason to fear her, since he regards as held on
         sufferance not only his goods and possessions and status, but even his body, his eyes and hand, and all that makes
         life more dear, and his very self; and he lives as though he were lent to himself and bound to return the loan on
         demand without complaint. Nor is he thereby cheap in his own eyes because he knows he is not his own, but he will act
         in all things as carefully and meticulously as a devout and holy man guards anything entrusted to him. And whenever
         he is ordered to repay his debt he will not complain to Fortune, but he will say: ‘I thank you for what I have
         possessed and held. I have looked after your property to my great benefit, but at your command I give and yield it
         with gratitude and good will. If you want me still to have anything of yours, I shall keep it safe; if you wish
         otherwise, I give back and restore to you my silver, both coined and plate, my house and my household.’ Should Nature
         demand back what she previously entrusted to us we shall say to her too: ‘Take back my spirit in better shape than
         when you gave it. I do not quibble or hang back: I am willing for you to have straightway what you gave me before I
         was conscious - take it.’ What is the harm in returning to the point whence you came? He will live badly who does not
         know how to die well. So we must first strip off the value we set on this thing and reckon the breath of life as
         something cheap. To quote Cicero, we hate gladiators if they are keen to save their life by any means; we favour them
         if they openly show contempt for it. You must realize that the same thing applies to us: for often the cause of dying
         is the fear of it. Dame Fortune, who makes sport with us, says, ‘Why should I preserve you, base and fearful
         creature? You will only receive more severe wounds and stabs, as you don’t know how to offer your throat. But you
         will both live longer and die more easily, since you receive the blade bravely, without withdrawing your neck and
         putting your hands in the way. He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man. But he who knows
         that this was the condition laid down for him at the moment of his conception will live on those terms, and at the
         same time he will guarantee with a similar strength of mind that no events take him by surprise. For by foreseeing
         anything that can happen as though it will happen he will soften the onslaught of all his troubles, which present no
         surprises to those who are ready and waiting for them, but fall heavily on those who are careless in the expectation
         that all will be well. There is disease, imprisonment, disaster, fire: none of these is unexpected - I did know in
         what riotous company Nature had enclosed me. So many times have the dead been lamented in my neighbourhood; so many
         times have torch and taper conducted untimely funerals past my threshold. Often has the crash of a falling building
         echoed beside me. Many who were linked to me through the forum and the senate and everyday conversation have been
         carried off in a night, which has severed the hands once joined in friendship. Should it surprise me if the perils
         which have always roamed around me should some day reach me? A great number of people plan a sea voyage with no
         thought of a storm. I shall never be ashamed to go to a bad author for a good quotation. Whenever Publilius abandoned
         the absurdities of the mime and language aimed at the gallery, he showed more force of intellect than the writers of
         tragedy and comedy; and he produced many thoughts more striking than those of tragedy, let alone farce, including
         this one: ‘What can happen to one can happen to all.’ If you let this idea sink into your vitals, and regard all the
         ills of other people (of which every day shows an enormous supply) as having a clear path to you too, you will be
         armed long before you are attacked. It is too late for the mind to equip itself to endure dangers once they are
         already there. ‘I didn’t think it would happen’ and ‘Would you ever have believed it would turn out so?’ Why ever
         not? Are there any riches which are not pursued by poverty and hunger and beggary? What rank is there whose purple
         robe and augur’s staff and patrician shoe-straps are not attended by squalor and the brand of disgrace and a thousand
         marks of shame and utter contempt? What kingship does not face ruin and trampling down, the tyrant and the hangman?
         And these things are not separated by wide intervals: there is only a brief hour between sitting on a throne and
         kneeling to another. Know, then, that every condition can change, and whatever happens to anyone can happen to you
         too. You are rich: but are you richer than Pompey? Yet even he lacked bread and water when Gaius, his old relation
         and new host, had opened the house of Caesar to him so that he could close his own. Though he possessed so many
         rivers flowing from source to mouth in his own lands, he had to beg for drops of water. He died of hunger and thirst
         in a kinsman’s palace, and while he starved his heir was organizing a state funeral for him. You have filled the
         highest offices: were they as high or unexpected or all-embracing as Sejanus had? Yet on the same day the senate
         escorted him to prison and the people tore him to pieces; and there was nothing left for the executioner to drag away
         of the man who had had everything heaped on him that gods and men could offer. You are a king: I shall not direct you
         to Croesus, who lived to see his own funeral pyre both lit and extinguished, thus surviving not only his kingdom but
         his own death; nor to Jugurtha, who was put on show to the Roman people within a year of causing them terror. We have
         seen Ptolemy, king of Africa, and Mithridates, king of Armenia, imprisoned by Gaius. One of them was sent into exile;
         the other hoped to be sent there in better faith. In all this topsy-turvy succession of events, unless you regard
         anything that can happen as bound to happen you give adversity a power over you which the man who sees it first can
         crush.
         <br>&emsp;The next thing to ensure is that we do not waste our energies pointlessly or in pointless activities: that
         is, not to long either for what we cannot achieve, or for what, once gained, only makes us realize too late and after
         much exertion the futility of our desires. In other words, let our labour not be in vain and without result, nor the
         result unworthy of our labour; for usually bitterness follows if either we do not succeed or we are ashamed of
         succeeding. We must cut down on all this dashing about that a great many people indulge in, as they throng around
         houses and theatres and fora: they intrude into other people’s affairs, always giving the impression of being busy.
         If you ask one of them as he comes out of a house, ‘Where are you going? What do you have in mind?’ he will reply, ‘I
         really don’t know; but I’ll see some people, I’ll do something.’ They wander around aimlessly looking for employment,
         and they do not what they intended but what they happen to run across. Their roaming is idle and poindess, like ants
         crawling over bushes, which purposelessly make their way right up to the topmost branch and then all the way down
         again. Many people live a life like these creatures, and you could not unjustly call it busy idleness. You will feel
         sorry for some folk you see rushing along as if to a fire; so often do they bump headlong into those in their way and
         send themselves and others sprawling, when all the time they have been running to call on someone who will not return
         the call, or to attend the funeral of somebody they don’t know, or the trial of somebody who is constantly involved
         in litigation, or the betrothal of a woman who is constandy getting married, and while attending a Utter have on
         occasion even carried it. They then return home, worn out to no purpose and swearing they themselves don’t know why
         they Went out or where they have been - and the next day they will wander forth on the same old round. So let all
         your activity be directed to some object, let it have some end in view. It is not industry that makes men restless,
         but false impressions of things drive them mad. For even madmen need some hope to stir them: the outward show of some
         object excites them because their deluded mind cannot detect its worthlessness. In the same way every individual
         among those who wander forth to swell a crowd is led round the city by empty and trivial reasons. Dawn drives him
         forth with nothing to do, and after he has been josded in vain on many men’s doorsteps and only succeeds in greeting
         their slave-announcers, shut out by many he finds no one at home with more difficulty than himself. This evil leads
         in turn to that most disgraceful vice of eavesdropping and prying into public and secret things and learning about
         many matters which are safe neither to talk about nor to listen to.
         <br>&emsp;I imagine that Democritus had this in mind when he began: ‘Anyone who wishes to live a quiet life should
         not engage in many activities either privately or publicly’ - meaning, of course, useless ones. For if they are
         essential, then not just many but countless things have to be done both privately and publicly. But when no binding
         duty summons us we must restrain our actions. For a man who is occupied with many things often puts himself into the
         power of Fortune, whereas the safest policy is rarely to tempt her, though to keep her always in mind and to trust
         her in nothing. Thus: ‘I shall sail unless something happens’; and ‘I shall become praetor unless something prevents
         me’; and ‘My business will be successful unless something interferes.’ That is why we say that nothing happens to the
         wise man against his expectation. We remove him not from the chances that befall mankind but from their mistakes, nor
         do all things turn out for him as he wished but as he reckoned - and above all he reckoned that something could block
         his plans. But inevitably the mind can cope more easily with the distress arising from disappointed longings if you
         have not promised it certain success.
         <br>&emsp;We should also make ourselves flexible, so that we do not pin our hopes too much on our set plans, and can
         move over to those things to which chance has brought us, without dreading a change in either our purpose or our
         condition, provided that fickleness, that fault most inimical to tranquillity, does not get hold of us. For
         obstinacy, from which Fortune often extorts something, is bound to bring wretchedness and anxiety, and much more
         serious is the fickleness that nowhere restrains itself. Both are hostile to tranquillity, and find change impossible
         and endurance impossible. In any case the mind must be recalled from external objects into itself: it must trust in
         itself, rejoice in itself, admire its own things; it must withdraw as much as possible from the affairs of others and
         devote its attention to itself; it must not feel losses and should take a kindly view even of misfortunes. When a
         shipwreck was reported and he heard that all his possessions had sunk, our founder Zeno said, ‘Fortune bids me be a
         less encumbered philosopher.’ When a tyrant threatened to kill the philosopher Theodorus, and indeed to leave him
         unburied, he replied, ‘You can please yourself, and my half-pint of blood is in your power; but as to burial, you are
         a fool if you think it matters to me whether I rot above or below ground.’Julius Canus, an outstandingly fine man,
         whom we can admire even though he was born in our age, had a long dispute with Gaius; and as he was going away that
         Phalaris said to him, ‘In case you are deluding yourself with foolish hopes, I have ordered you to be led off to
         execution.’ His reply was ‘I thank you, noble emperor.’ I am not certain what he meant, for many possibilities occur
         to me. Did he mean to be insulting by showing the extent of the cruelty which caused death to be a blessing? Was he
         taunting him with his daily bouts of madness (for people used to thank him whose children had been murdered and whose
         property had been confiscated)? Was he accepting his sentence as a welcome release? Whatever he meant, it was a
         spirited reply. Someone will say, ‘After this Gaius could have ordered him to live.’ Canus was not afraid of that:
         Gaius was known to keep his word in commands of that sort. Will you believe that Canus spent the ten days leading up
         to his execution without any anxiety at all? It is incredible what that man said, what he did, how calm he remained.
         He was playing draughts when the centurion who was dragging off a troop of condemned men ordered him to be summoned
         too. At the call he counted his pieces and said to his companion, ‘See that you don’t falsely claim after my death
         that you won.’ Then, nodding to the centurion, he said, ‘You will be witness that I am leading by one piece.’ Do you
         think Canus was just enjoying his game at that board? He was enjoying his irony. His friends were sorrowful at the
         prospect of losing such a man, and he said to them, ‘Why are you sad? You are wondering whether souls are immortal: I
         shall soon know.’ He did not cease searching for the truth right up to the end and making his own death a topic for
         discussion. His philosophy teacher went with him, and when they were not far from the mound on which our god Caesar
         received his daily offering, he said, ‘Canus, what are you thinking about now? What is your state of mind?’ Canus
         replied, ‘I have decided to take note whether in that most fleeting moment the spirit is aware of its departure from
         the body’; and he promised that if he discovered anything he would visit his friends in turn and reveal to them the
         state of the soul. Just look at that serenity in the midst of a hurricane, that spirit worthy of immortality, which
         invokes its own fate to establish the truth, and in that very last phase of life questions the departing soul and
         seeks to learn something not only up to the time of death but from the very experience of death itself. No one ever
         pursued philosophy longer. So great a man will not quickly be relinquished, and he should be referred to with
         respect: glorious spirit, who swelled the roll of Gaius’ victims, we shall ensure your immortality.
         <br>&emsp;But there is no point in banishing the causes of private sorrow, for sometimes we are gripped by a hatred
         of the human race. When you consider how rare is simplicity and how unknown is innocence, how you scarcely ever find
         loyalty except when it is expedient, what a host of successful crimes you come across, and all the things equally
         hateful that men gain and lose through lust, and how ambition is now so far from setting limits to itself that it
         acquires a lustre from viciousness - all this drives the mind into a darkness whose shadows overwhelm it, as though
         those virtues were overturned which it is not possible to hope for and not useful to possess. We must therefore
         school ourselves to regard all commonly held vices as not hateful but ridiculous, and we should imitate Democritus
         rather than Heraclitus. For whenever these went out in public, the latter used to weep and the former to laugh; the
         latter thought all our activities sorrows, the former, follies. So we should make light of all things and endure them
         with tolerance: it is more civilized to make fun of life than to bewail it. Bear in mind too that he deserves better
         of the human race as well who laughs at it than he who grieves over it; since the one allows it a fair prospect of
         hope, while the other stupidly laments over things he cannot hope will be put right. And, all things considered, it
         is the mark of a greater mind not to restrain laughter than not to restrain tears, since laughter expresses the
         gentlest of our feelings, and reckons that nothing is great or serious or even wretched in all the trappings of our
         existence. Let every man contemplate the individual occurrences which bring us joy or grief, and he will learn the
         truth of Bion’s dictum, that all the activities of men are like their beginnings, and their life is not more
         high-souled or serious than their conception, and that being born from nothing they are reduced to nothing. Yet it is
         preferable to accept calmly public behaviour and human failings, and not to collapse into either laughter or tears.
         For to be tormented by other people’s troubles means perpetual misery, while to take delight in them is an inhuman
         pleasure; just as it is an empty show of kindness to weep and assume a solemn look because somebody is burying a son.
         In your own troubles too, the appropriate conduct is to indulge as much grief as nature, not custom, demands: for
         many people weep in order to be seen weeping, though their eyes are dry as long as there is nobody looking, since
         they regard it as bad form not to weep when everyone is weeping. This evil of taking our cue from others has become
         so deeply ingrained that even that most basic feeling, grief, degenerates into imitation.
         <br>&emsp;We must next look at a category of occurrences which with good reason cause us grief and anxiety. When good
         men come to a bad end, when Socrates is compelled to die in prison and Rutilius to live in exile, when Pompey and
         Cicero have to offer their necks to their clients, when Cato, that living pattern of the virtues, has to fall on his
         sword to show the world what is happening to himself and the state at the same time; then we have to feel anguish
         that Fortune hands out such unfair rewards. And what can each of us then hope for himself when he sees the best men
         suffering the worst fates? What follows then? Observe how each of those men bore his fate; and if they were brave,
         long with your spirit for a spirit like theirs; if they died with womanly cowardice, then nothing died with them.
         Either they are worthy of your admiration for their courage or unworthy of your longing for their cowardice. For what
         is more disgraceful than if supremely great men by dying bravely make others fearful? Let us repeatedly praise one
         who deserves praise and let us say: ‘The braver one is, the happier he is! You have escaped all mischances, envy and
         disease; you have come forth from prison - not that you seemed to the gods worthy of ill fortune, but unworthy that
         Fortune should any longer have power over you.’ But we have to lay hands on those who pull back and at the very point
         of death look back towards life. I shall weep for no one who is happy and for no one who is weeping: the one has
         himself wiped away my tears; the other by his own tears has proved himself unworthy of any. Should I weep for
         Hercules because he was burned alive, or Regulus because he was pierced by all those nails, or Cato because he
         wounded his own wounds? All of them by giving up a brief spell of time found the way to become eternal, and by dying
         achieved immortality.
         <br>&emsp;There is also another not inconsiderable source of anxieties, if you are too concerned to assume a pose and
         do not reveal yourself openly to anyone, like many people whose lives are false and aimed only at outward show. For
         it is agonizing always to be watching yourself in fear of being caught when your usual mask has slipped. Nor can we
         ever be carefree when we think that whenever we are observed we are appraised; for many things happen to strip us of
         our pretensions against our will, and even if all this attention to oneself succeeds, yet the life of those who
         always live behind a mask is not pleasant or free from care. On the contrary, how full of pleasure is that honest and
         naturally unadorned simplicity that in no way hides its disposition! Yet this life too runs a risk of being scorned
         if everything is revealed to everybody; for with some people familiarity breeds contempt. But there is no danger of
         virtue being held cheap as a result of close observation, and it is better to be despised for simplicity than to
         suffer agonies from everlasting pretence. Still, let us use moderation here: there is a big difference between living
         simply and living carelessly.
         <br>&emsp;We should also withdraw a lot into ourselves; for associating with people unlike ourselves upsets a calm
         disposition, stirs up passions again, and aggravates any mental weakness which has not been completely cured.
         However, the two things must be mingled and varied, solitude and joining a crowd: the one will make us long for
         people and the other for ourselves, and each will be a remedy for the other; solitude will cure our distaste for a
         crowd, and a crowd will cure our boredom with solitude.
         <br>&emsp;The mind should not be kept continuously at the same pitch of concentration, but given amusing diversions.
         Socrates did not blush to play with small children; Cato soothed his mind with wine when it was tired from the cares
         of state; and Scipio used to disport that triumphal and military form in the dance, not shuffling about delicately in
         the present style, when even in walking men mince and wriggle with more than effeminate voluptuousness, but in the
         old-fashioned, manly style in which men danced at times of games and festivals, without loss of dignity even if their
         enemies were watching them. Our minds must relax: they will rise better and keener after a rest. Just as you must not
         force fertile farmland, as uninterrupted productivity will soon exhaust it, so constant effort will sap our mental
         vigour, while a short period of rest and relaxation will restore our powers. Unremitting effort leads to a kind of
         mental dullness and lethargy. Nor would men’s wishes move so much in this direction if sport and play did not involve
         a sort of natural pleasure; though repeated indulgence in these will destroy all the gravity and force of our minds.
         After all, sleep too is essential as a restorative, but if you prolong it constantly day and night it will be death.
         There is a big difference between slackening your hold on something and severing the link. Law-givers established
         holidays to give people a public mandate to enjoy themselves, thinking it necessary to introduce a sort of balance
         into their labours; and, as I said, certain great men gave themselves monthly holidays on fixed days, while others
         divided every day into periods of leisure and work. I remember that this was the practice of the great orator Asinius
         Pollio, whom nothing kept at work after the tenth hour. After that time he would not even read his letters, in case
         something fresh cropped up to be dealt with; but in those two hours he would rid himself of the weariness of the
         whole day. Some take a break in the middle of the day and keep any less demanding task for the afternoon hours. Our
         ancestors also forbad any new motion to be introduced in the senate after the tenth hour. The army divides the
         watches, and those who are returning from an expedition are exempt from night duty. We must indulge the mind and from
         time to time allow it the leisure which is its food and strength. We must go for walks out of doors, so that the mind
         can be strengthened and invigorated by a clear sky and plenty of fresh air. At times it will acquire fresh energy
         from a journey by carriage and a change of scene, or from socializing and drinking freely. Occasionally we should
         even come to the point of intoxication, sinking into drink but not being totally flooded by it; for it does wash away
         cares, and stirs the mind to its depths, and heals sorrow just as it heals certain diseases. Liber was not named
         because he loosens the tongue, but because he liberates the mind from its slavery to cares, emancipates it,
         invigorates it, and emboldens it for all its undertakings. But there is a healthy moderation in wine, as in liberty.
         Solon and Arcesilas are thought to have liked their wine, and Cato has been accused of drunkenness; whoever accused
         him will more easily make the charge honourable than Cato disgraceful. But we must not do this often, in case the
         mind acquires a bad habit; yet at times it must be stimulated to rejoice without restraint and austere soberness must
         be banished for a while. For whether we agree with the Greek poet that Sometimes it is sweet to be mad,’ or with
         Plato that ‘A man sound in mind knocks in vain at the doors of poetry,’ or with Aristotle that ‘No great intellect
         has been without a touch of madness,’ only a mind that is deeply stirred can utter something noble and beyond the
         power of others. When it has scorned everyday and commonplace thoughts and risen aloft on the wings of divine
         inspiration, only then does it sound a note nobler than mortal voice could utter. As long as it remains in its senses
         it cannot reach any lofty and difficult height: it must desert the usual track and race away, champing the bit and
         hurrying its driver in its course to a height it would have feared to scale by itself.
         <br>&emsp;So here you have, my dear Serenus, the means of preserving your tranquillity, the means of restoring it,
         and the means of resisting the faults that creep up on you unawares. But be sure of this, that none of them is strong
         enough for those who want to preserve such a fragile thing, unless the wavering mind is surrounded by attentive and
         unceasing care.

   I do not doubt that I often happen to talk of things which are treated better in the writings of master-craftsmen, and with more authenticity. What you have here is purely an assay of my natural, not at all of my acquired, abilities. Anyone who catches me out in ignorance does me no harm: I cannot vouch to other people for my reasonings: I can scarcely vouch for them to myself and am by no means satisfied with them. If anyone is looking for knowledge let him go where such fish are to be caught: there is nothing I lay claim to less. These are my own thoughts, by which I am striving to make known not matter but me. Perhaps I shall master that matter one day; or perhaps I did do so once when Fortune managed to bring me to places where light is thrown on it. But I no longer remember anything about that. I may be a man of fairly wide reading, but I retain nothing.  
   <br>&emsp;So I guarantee you nothing for certain, except my making known what point I have so far reached in my knowledge of it. Do not linger over the matter but over my fashioning of it. Where my borrowings are concerned, see whether I have been able to select something which improves my theme: I get others to say what I cannot put so well myself, sometimes because of the weakness of my language and sometimes because of the weakness of my intellect. I do not count my borrowings: I weigh them; if I had wanted them valued for their number I would have burdened myself with twice as many. They are all, except for very, very few, taken from names so famous and ancient that they seem to name themselves without help from me. In the case of those reasonings and original ideas which I transplant into my own soil and confound with my own, I sometimes deliberately omit to give the author’s name so as to rein in the temerity of those hasty criticisms which leap to attack writings of every kind, especially recent writings by men still alive and in our vulgar tongue which allow anyone to talk about them and which seem to convict both their conception and design of being just as vulgar. I want them to flick Plutarch’s nose in mistake for mine and to scald themselvesby insulting the Seneca in me. I have to hide my weakness beneath those great reputations. I will love the man who can pluck out my feathers – I mean by the perspicacity of his judgement and by his sheer ability to distinguish the force and beauty of the topics. Myself, who am constantly unable to sort out my borrowings by my knowledge of where they came from, am quite able to measure my reach and to know that my own soil is in no wise capable of bringing forth some of the richer flowers that I find rooted there and which all the produce of my own growing could never match.  
   <br>&emsp;What I am obliged to answer for is for getting myself tangled up, or if there is any inanity or defect in my reasoning which I do not see or which I am incapable of seeing once it is pointed out to me. Faults can often escape our vigilance: sickness of judgement consists in not perceiving them when they are revealed to us. Knowledge and truth can lodge within us without judgement; judgement can do so without them: indeed, recognizing our ignorance is one of the surest and most beautiful witnesses to our judgement that I can find.  
   <br>&emsp;I have no sergeant-major to marshal my arguments other than Fortune. As my ravings present themselves, I pile them up; sometimes they all come crowding together: sometimes they drag along in single file. I want people to see my natural ordinary stride, however much it wanders off the path. I let myself go along as I find myself to be; anyway the matters treated here are not such that ignorance of them cannot be permitted nor talking of them casually or rashly. I would very much love to grasp things with a complete understanding but I cannot bring myself to pay the high cost of doing so. My design is to spend whatever life I have left gently and unlaboriously. I am not prepared to bash my brains for anything, not even for learning’s sake however precious it may be. From books all I seek is to give myself pleasure by an honourable pastime: or if I do study, I seek only that branch of learning which deals with knowing myself and which teaches me how to live and die well:              
   <br>&emsp;This is the winning-post towards which my sweating horse must run.       
   <br>&emsp;If I come across difficult passages in my reading I never bite my nails over them: after making a charge or two I let them be. If I settled down to them I would waste myself and my time, for my mind is made for the first jump. What I fail to see during my original charge I see even less when I stubborn it out.I can do nothing without gaiety: persistence and too much intensity dazzle my judgement, making it sad and weary. My vision becomes confused and dissipated: I must tell it to withdraw and then make fresh glancing attacks, just as we are told to judge the sheen of scarlet-cloth by running our eyes over it several times, catching various glimpses of it, sudden, repeated and renewed.  
   <br>&emsp;If one book wearies me I take up another, applying myself to it only during those hours when I begin to be gripped by boredom at doing nothing. I do not have much to do with books by modern authors, since the Ancients seem to me to be more taut and ample; nor with books in Greek, since my judgement cannot do its job properly on the basis of a schoolboy, apprenticed understanding.  
   <br>&emsp;Among books affording plain delight, I judge that the Decameron of Boccaccio, Rabelais and the Basia of Johannes Secundus (if they are to be placed in this category) are worth spending time on. As for the Amadis and such like, they did not have enough authority to captivate me even in childhood. I will also add, boldly or rashly, that this aged heavy soul of mine can no longer be tickled by good old Ovid (let alone Ariosto): his flowing style and his invention, which once enraptured me, now hardly have the power of holding my attention.  
   <br>&emsp;I freely say what I think about all things – even about those which doubtless exceed my competence and which I in no wise claim to be within my jurisdiction. When I express my opinions it is so as to reveal the measure of my sight not the measure of the thing. When I find that I have no taste for the Axiochus of Plato – a weak book, considering its author – my judgement does not trust itself: it is not so daft as to oppose the authority of so many other judgements, famous and ancient, which it holds as its professors and masters: rather is it happy to err with them. It blames itself, condemning itself either for stopping at the outer rind and for being unable to get right down to the bottom of things, or else for looking at the matter in some false light. My judgement is quite content merely to protect itself from confusion and unruliness: as for its weakness, it willingly acknowledges it and avows it. What it thinks it should do is to give a just interpretation of such phenomena as its power of conception presents it with: but they are feeble ones and imperfect. Most of Aesop’s fables have several senses and several ways of being understood. Those who treat them as myths select some aspect which squares well with the fable; yet in most cases that is only the first surface facet of them: there are other facets, more vivid, more of their essence, more inward, to which they never manage to penetrate; that is what I do.  
   <br>&emsp;But to get on: it has always seemed to me that in poetry Virgil, Lucretius, Catullus and Horace rank highest by far – especially Virgil in his Georgics, which I reckon to bethe most perfect achievement in poetry; by a comparison with it one can easily see that there are passages in the Aeneid to which Virgil, if he had been able, would have given a touch of the comb. And in the Aeneid the fifth book seems to me the most perfect. I also love Lucan and like to be often in his company, not so much for his style as for his own worth and for the truth of his opinions and judgements. As for that good poet Terence – the grace and delight of the Latin tongue – I find him wonderful at vividly depicting the emotions of the soul and the modes of our behaviour; our own actions today constantly bring me back to him. However often I read him I always find some new grace and beauty in him.  
   <br>&emsp;Those who lived soon after Virgil’s time complained that some put Lucretius on a par with him. My opinion is that such a comparison is indeed between unequals; yet I have quite a job confirming myself in that belief when I find myself enthralled by one of Lucretius’ finer passages. If they were irritated by that comparison what would they say of the animal stupidity and barbarous insensitivity of those who now compare Ariosto with him? And what would Ariosto himself say? O what a silly, tasteless age!     
   <br>&emsp;I reckon that the Ancients had even more reason to complain of those who put Plautus on a par with Terence (who savours much more of the nobleman) than of those who did so for Lucretius and Virgil. It does much for Terence’s reputation and superiority that the Father of Roman Eloquence has him – alone in his class – often on his lips, and so too the verdict which the best judge among Roman poets gave of his fellow-poet.  
   <br>&emsp;It has often occurred to me that those of our contemporaries who undertake to write comedies (such as the Italians, who are quite good at it) use three or four plots from Terence or Plautus to make one of their own. In one single comedy they pile up five or six tales from Boccaccio. What makes them so burden themselves with matter is their lack of confidence in their ability to sustain themselves with their own graces: they need something solid to lean on; not having enough in themselves to captivate us they want the story to detain us. In the case of my author, Terence, it is quite the reverse: the perfections and beauties of the fashioning of his language make us lose our craving for his subject: everywhere it is his elegance and his graciousness which hold us; everywhere he is so delightful – flowing exactly like a pure fountain – and he so fills our souls to the brim with his graces that we forget those of his plot.  
   <br>&emsp;Considerations like these encourage me to go further: I note that the good poets of Antiquity avoided any striving to display not only such fantastic hyperboles as the Spaniards and the Petrarchists do but even those sweeter and more restrained acute phrases which adorn all works of poetry in the following centuries. Yet not one sound judge regrets that the Ancients lacked them nor fails to admire the incomparable even smoothness and the sustained sweetness and flourishing beauty of the epigrams of Catullus above the sharp goads with which Martial enlivens the tails of his. The reason for this is the same as I stated just now, and as Martial said of himself:  He had less need to strive after originality, its place had been taken by his matter. Those earlier poets achieve their effects without getting excited and goading themselves on; they find laughter everywhere: they do not have to go and tickle themselves! The later ones need extraneous help: the less spirit they have, the more body they need. They get up on their horses because they cannot stand on their own legs. It is the same with our dancing: those men of low estate who teach it are unable to copy the deportment and propriety of our nobility and so try to gain favour by their daring footwork and other strange acrobatics. And it is far easier for ladies to cut a figure in dances which require a variety of intricate bodily movements than in certain other stately dances in which they merely have to walk with a natural step and display their native bearing and their usual graces. Just as some excellent clowns whom I have seen are able to give us all the delight which can be drawn from their art while wearing their everyday clothes, whereas to put us in a laughing mood their apprentices and those who are less deeply learned in that art have to put flour on their faces, dress up in funny clothes and hide behind silly movements and grimaces.  
   <br>&emsp;Better than any other way this idea as I conceive it can be understood from a comparison between the Aeneid and the Orlando furioso. We can see the Aeneid winging aloft with a firm and soaring flight, always pursuing its goal: the Orlando furioso we see hopping and fluttering from tale to tale as from branch to branch, nevertrusting its wings except to cross a short distance, seeking to alight on every hedge lest its wind or strength should give out, ‘Trying out its wings on little sorties.’    
   <br>&emsp;As for my other category of books (that which mixes a little more usefulness with the delight and from which I learn how to control my humours and my qualities), the authors whom I find most useful for that are Plutarch (since he has become a Frenchman) and Seneca. They both are strikingly suited to my humour in that the knowledge that I seek from them is treated in pieces not sewn together (and so do not require me to bind myself to some lengthy labour, of which I am quite incapable). Such are the Moral Works of Plutarch, as well as the Epistles of Seneca which are the most beautiful part of his writings and the most profitable. I do not need a great deal of preparation to get down to them and I can drop them whenever I like, for one part of them does not really lead to another. Those two authors are in agreement over most useful and true opinions; they were both fated to be born about the same period; both to be the tutors of Roman Emperors; both came from foreign lands and both were rich and powerful. Their teachings are some of the cream of philosophy and are presented in a simple and appropriate manner. Plutarch is more uniform and constant: Seneca is more diverse and comes in waves. Seneca stiffens and tenses himself, toiling to arm virtue against weakness, fear and vicious appetites; Plutarch seems to judge those vices to be less powerful and to refuse to condescend to hasten his step or to rely on a shield. Plutarch holds to Plato’s opinions, which are gentle and well-suited to public life: Seneca’s opinions are Stoic and Epicurean, farther from common practice but in my judgement more suited to the individual and firmer. It seems that Seneca bowed somewhat to the tyranny of the Emperors of his day, for I hold it for certain that his judgement was under duress when he condemned the cause of those great-souled murderers of Caesar; Plutarch is a free man from end to end. Seneca is full of pithy phrases and sallies; Plutarch is full of matter. Seneca enflames you and stirs you: Plutarch is more satisfying and repays you more. Plutarch leads us: Seneca drives us.  
   <br>&emsp;As for Cicero, the works of his which are most suitable to my projects are thosewhich above all deal with moral philosophy. But to tell the truth boldly (for once we have crossed the boundaries of insolence there is no reining us in) his style of writing seems boring to me, and so do all similar styles. For his introductory passages, his definitions, his sub-divisions and his etymologies eat up most of his work; what living marrow there is in him is smothered by the tedium of his preparations. If I spend an hour reading him (which is a lot for me) and then recall what pith and substance I have got out of him, most of the time I find nothing but wind, for he has not yet got to the material which serves my purposes and to the reasoning which actually touches on the core of what I am interested in. For me, who am only seeking to become more wise not more learned or more eloquent, all those marshallings of Aristotelian logic are irrelevant; I want authors to begin with their conclusion: I know well enough what is meant by death or voluptuousness: let them not waste time dissecting them; from the outset I am looking for good solid reasons which teach me how to sustain their attacks. Neither grammatical subtleties nor ingenuity in weaving words or arguments help me in that. I want arguments which drive home their first attack right into the strongest point of doubt: Cicero’s hover about the pot and languish. They are all right for the classroom, the pulpit or the Bar where we are free to doze off and find ourselves a quarter of an hour later still with time to pick up the thread of the argument. You have to talk like that to judges whom you want to win over whether you are right or wrong, or to schoolboys and the common people to whom you have to say the lot and see what strikes home. I do not want authors to strive to gain my attention by crying Oyez fifty times like our heralds. The Romans in their religion used to cry Hoc age! This do!, just as in our own we cry Sursum corda Lift up your hearts; for me they are so many wasted words. I leave home fully prepared: I need no sauce or appetizers: I can eat my meat quite raw; and instead of whetting my appetite with those preliminaries and preparations they deaden it for me and dull it.  
   <br>&emsp;Now the most appropriate historians for me are those who write men’s lives, since they linger more over motives than events, over what comes from inside more than what happens outside. That is why, of historians of every kind, Plutarch is the man for me.  
   <br>&emsp;I am deeply sorry that we do not have Diogenes Laertiuses by the dozen, or that he himself did not spread himself more widely or more wisely, for I consider the lives and fortunes of the great teachers of mankind no less carefully than their ideas and doctrines.  
   <br>&emsp;In this genre – the study of history – we must without distinction leaf our way through all kinds of authors, ancient and modern, in pidgin and in French, so as to learn about the matter which they treat in their divergent ways. But Caesar seems to me to deserve special study, not only to learn historical facts but on his own account, since his perfection excels that of all others, even including Sallust.  
   <br>&emsp;I certainly read Caesar with rather more reverence and awe than is usual for the works of men, at times considering the man himself through his deeds and the miracle of his greatness, at others the purity and the inimitable polish of his language which not only surpassed that of all other historians, as Cicero said, but perhaps that of Cicero himself. There is such a lack of bias in his judgement when he talks of his enemies that the only thing you can reproach him with, apart from the deceptive colours under which he seeks to hide his bad cause and the filth of his pernicious ambition, is that he talks of himself too sparingly. For so many great things cannot have been done by him without he himself contributing more to them than he includes in his books.  
   <br>&emsp;I like either very simple historians or else outstanding ones. The simple ones, who have nothing of their own to contribute, merely bringing to their task care and diligence in collecting everything which comes to their attention and chronicling everything ingood faith without choice or selection, leave our judgement intact for the discerning of the truth. Among others there is for example that good man Froissart who strides with such frank sincerity through his enterprise that when he has made an error he is never afraid to admit it and to correct it at whatever point he has reached when told about it; and he relates all the various rumours which were current and the differing reports that were made to him. Here is the very stuff of history, naked and unshaped: each man can draw such profit from it as his understanding allows.  
   <br>&emsp;The truly outstanding historians are capable of choosing what is worth knowing; they can select which of two reports is the more likely; from the endowments and humours of princes they can draw conclusions about their intentions and attribute appropriate words to them. Such historians are right to assume the authority of controlling what we accept by what they do: but that certainly belongs to very few.  
   <br>&emsp;Those who lie in between (as most historians do) spoil everything for us: they want to chew things over for us; they give themselves the right to make judgements and consequently bend history to their own ideas: for once our judgement leans to one side we cannot stop ourselves twisting and distorting the narration to that bias. They take on the task of choosing what is worth knowing, often hiding from us some speech or private action which would have taught us much more; they leave out things they find incredible because they do not understand them, and doubtless leave out others because they do not know how to put them into good Latin or French. Let them make a display of their rhetoric and their arguments if they dare to; let them judge as they like: but let them leave us the means of making our own judgements after them; let them not deprave by their abridgements nor arrange by their selection anything of material substance, but rather let them pass it all on to us purely and wholly, in all its dimensions.  
   <br>&emsp;As often as not, and especially in our own times, historiographers are appointed from among quite commonplace people, simply on account of their knowing how to write well, as though we wanted to learn grammar! They are right, having been paid to do that and having nothing but chatter to sell, to worry mainly about that aspect. And so with many a fine phrase they spin a web of rumours gathered at the crossroads of our cities.  
   <br>&emsp;The only good histories are those written by men who were actually in charge of affairs or who played some part in that charge, or who at least were fortunate enough to have been in charge of others of a similar kind. Such were virtually all the Greek and Roman historians. For, with several eye-witnesses having written on the same subject (as happened in those days when greatness and learning were commonly found together), if an error were made it must have been wonderfully slight, or concern some incident itself open to great doubt.  
   <br>&emsp;What can we hope from a doctor who writes about war, or a schoolboy writing about the designs of kings?  
   <br>&emsp;To realize how scrupulous the Romans were over this, we need only one example: Asinius Pollio found even in Caesar’s histories some mistakes into which he had fallen because he had not been able to look with his own eyes at every part of his army and had believed individual men who had reported to him things which were often inadequately verified, or else because he had not been carefully enough informed by his commanders-delegate of their conduct of affairs during his absence.  
   <br>&emsp;We can see from that example what a delicate thing our quest for truth is when we cannot even rely on the commander’s knowledge of a battle he has fought nor on the soldiers’ accounts of what went on round them unless, as in a judicial inquiry, we confront witnesses and accept objections to alleged proofs of the finer points of every occurrence. Truly, the knowledge we have of our own affairs is much slacker. But that has been adequately treated by Bodin, and in conformity with my own ideas.  
   <br>&emsp;To help my defective and treacherous memory a little – and it is so extremely bad that I have more than once happened to pick up again, thinking it new and unknown to me, a book which I had carefully read several years earlier and scribbled all over with my notes – I have for some time now adopted the practice of adding at the end of each book (I mean of each book which I intend to read only once) the date when I finished reading it and the general judgement I drew from it, in order to show me again at least the general idea and impression I had conceived of its author when reading it. I would like to transcribe here some of those annotations.  
   <br>&emsp;Here is what I put about ten years ago on my Guicciardini (for no matter what language is spoken by my books, I speak to them in my own): ‘He is an industrious writer of history, from whom in my judgement we can learn the truth about the affairs of his time more accurately than from any other; moreover he played a part in most of them, holding an honoured position. There is no sign that he ever disguised anything through hatred, favour or vanity; that is vouched for by the unfettered judgements he makes of the great, especially of those by whom he had been promoted to serve in responsible positions, such as Pope Clement VII. As for the quality in which he seems to want most to excel, namely his digressions and reflections, some are excellent and enriched by beautiful sketches; but he enjoyed them too much: he did not want to leave anything out, yet his subject was a full and ample one – infinite almost – and so he can become sloppy and somewhat redolent of academic chatter. I have also been struck bythe following: that among all his judgements on minds and actions, among so many motives and intentions, he attributes not one of them to virtue, religious scruple or conscience, as if those qualities had been entirely snuffed out in our world; and among all those deeds, no matter how beautiful they might seem in themselves, he attributes their cause to some evil opportunity or gain. It is impossible to conceive that among the innumerable actions on which he makes a judgement there were not at least some produced by means of reason. No corruption can have infected everyone so totally that there was not some man or other who escaped the contagion. That leads me to fear that his own taste was somewhat corrupted: perhaps he happened to base his estimates of others on himself.’  
   <br>&emsp;This is what I have on my Philippe de Commines: ‘You will find the language here smooth and delightful, of a natural simplicity; the narration pure, with the good faith of the author manifestly shining through it; himself free from vanity when talking of himself, and of favour and of envy when talking of others, together with a fine zeal for truth rather than any unusual acuteness; and from end to end, authority and weight showing him to be a man of good extraction and brought up to great affairs.’  
   <br>&emsp;And on the Memoirs of Monsieur Du Bellay, the following:  
   <br>&emsp;‘It is always a pleasure to see things written about by those who had assayed how to manage them, but there is no denying that in these two noblemen there is clearly revealed a great decline from that shining frankness and freedom in writing found in older authors of their rank such as the Seigneur de Joinville (the close friend of Saint Louis), Eginhard (the Chancellor of Charlemagne) and more recently Philippe de Commines. This is not history so much as pleading the case of King Francis against the Emperor Charles V. I am unwilling to believe that they altered any of the major facts, but they make it their job to distort the judgement of events to our advantage, often quite unreasonably, and to pass over anything touchy in the life of their master: witness the fall from grace of the Seigneur de Montmorency and the Seigneur de Brion, which is simply omitted: indeed the very name of Madame d’Estampes is not to be found in them! Secret deeds can be hushed up, but to keep silent about things which everyone knows about, especially things which led to public actions of such consequence, is a defect which cannot be pardoned. In short if you take my advice you should look elsewhere for a full account of King Francis and the events of his time; what can be profitable are the particulars given of the battles and military engagements when these noblemen were present; a few private words and deeds of a few princes of their time; and the transactions and negotiations conducted by the Seigneur de Langey which are chock full of things worth knowing and of uncommon reflections.’

<div class="content-text hidden" id="OnSolitude">
   Let us leave aside those long comparisons between the solitary life and the active one; and as for that fine adage used as a cloak by greed and ambition, ‘That we are not born for ourselves alone but for the common weal,’ let us venture to refer to those who have joined in the dance: let them bare their consciences and confess whether rank, office and all the bustling business of the world are not sought on the contrary to gain private profit from the common weal. The evil methods which men use to get ahead in our century clearly show that their aims cannot be worth much.  
   <br>&emsp;Let us retort to ambition that she herself gives us a taste for solitude, for does she shun anything more than fellowship? Does she seek anything more than room to use her elbows?  
   <br>&emsp;The means of doing good or evil can be found anywhere, but if that quip of Bias is true, that ‘the evil form the larger part’, or what Ecclesiasticus says, ‘One good man in a thousand have I not found’.
   
   <div class="qu">Good men are rare: just about as many as gates in the walls of Thebes or mouths to the fertile Nile </div>
   
   Then contagion is particularly dangerous in crowds. Either you must loathe the wicked or imitate them. It is dangerous both to grow like them because they are many, or to loathe many of them because they are different.  
   <br>&emsp;It is not that a wise man cannot live happily anywhere nor be alone in a crowd of courtiers, but Bias says that, if he has the choice, the wise man will avoid the very sight of them. If he has to, he will put up with the former, but if he can he will choose the other. He thinks that he is not totally free of vice if he has to contend with the vices of others. Those who haunted evil-doers were chastised as evil by Charondas.  
   <br>&emsp;There is nothing more unsociable than Man, and nothing more sociable: unsociable by his vice, sociable by his nature. And Antisthenes does not seem to me to have given an adequate reply to the person who reproached him for associating with the wicked, when he retorted that doctors live among the sick: for even if doctors do help the sick to return to health they impair their own by constantly seeing and touching diseases as they treat them.  
   <br>&emsp;Now the end I think is always the same: how to live in leisure at our ease. But people do not always seek the way properly. Often they think they have left their occupations behind when they have merely changed them. There is hardly less torment in running a family than in running a whole country. Whenever our soul finds something to do she is there in her entirety: domestic tasks may be less important but they are no less importunate. Anyway, by ridding ourselves of Court and market-place we do not rid ourselves of the principal torments of our life.             
   <br>&emsp;It is reason and wisdom which take away cares, not places affording wide views over the sea, nor do ambition, covetousness, irresolution, fear and desires do not abandon us just because we have changed our landscape. Why do we leave for lands warmed by a foreign sun? What fugitive from his own land can flee from himself? Socrates was told that some man had not been improved by travel. ‘I am sure he was not,’ he said. ‘He went with himself!’                            
   <br>&emsp;If you do not first lighten yourself and your soul of the weight of your burdens, moving about will only increase their pressure on you, as a ship’s cargo is less troublesome when lashed in place. You do more harm than good to a patient by moving him about: you shake his illness down into the sack, Al just as you drive stakes in by pulling and waggling them about. That is why it is not enough to withdraw from the mob, not enough to go to another place: we have to withdraw from such attributes of the mob as are within us. It is our own self we have to isolate and take back into possession. ‘I have broken my chains,’ you say. But a struggling cur may snap its chain, only to escape with a great length of it fixed to its collar. We take our fetters with us; our freedom is not total: we still turn our gaze towards the things we have left behind; our imagination is full of them. It is in our soul that evil grips us: and she cannot escape from herself: That mind is at fault which never escapes from itself. So we must bring her back, haul her back, into our self. That is true solitude. It can be enjoyed in towns and in kings’ courts, but more conveniently apart.  
   <br>&emsp;Now since we are undertaking to live, without companions, by ourselves, let us make our happiness depend on ourselves; let us loose ourselves from the bonds which tie us to others; let us gain power over ourselves to live really and truly alone – and of doing so in contentment.  
   <br>&emsp;Stilpo had escaped from the great conflagration of his city in which he had lost wife, children and goods; when Demetrius Poliorcetes saw him in the midst of so great a destruction of his homeland, yet with his face undismayed, he asked him if he had suffered no harm. He said, No. Thank God he had lost nothing of his. The philosopher Antisthenes put the same thing amusingly when he said that a man ought to provide himself with unsinkable goods, which could float out of a shipwreck with him.  
   <br>&emsp;Certainly, if he still has himself, a man of understanding has lost nothing. When the city of Nola was sacked by the Barbarians, the local Bishop Paulinus lost everything and was thrown into prison; yet this was his prayer: ‘Keep me O Lord from feeling this loss. Thou knowest that the Barbarians have so far touched nothing of mine.’ Those riches which did enrich him and those good things which made him good were still intact.  
   <br>&emsp;There you see what it means to choose treasures which no harm can corrupt and to hide them in a place which no one can enter, no one betray, save we ourselves. Weshould have wives, children, property and, above all, good health… if we can: but we should not become so attached to them that our happiness depends on them. We should set aside a room, just for ourselves, at the back of the shop, keeping it entirely free and establishing there our true liberty, our principal solitude and asylum. Within it our normal conversation should be of ourselves, with ourselves, so privy that no commerce or communication with the outside world should find a place there; there we should talk and laugh as though we had no wife, no children, no possessions, no followers, no menservants, so that when the occasion arises that we must lose them it should not be a new experience to do without them. We have a soul able able to turn in on herself; she can keep herself company; she has the wherewithal to attack, to defend, to receive and to give. Let us not fear that in such a solitude as that we shall be crouching in painful idleness: in lonely places, be a crowd unto yourself, for, as Antisthenes says, ‘that Virtue contents herself, without regulations, words or actions -she dearly bes’.         
   <br>&emsp;That man you can see over there, furiously beside himself, scrambling high up on the ruins of that battlement, the target of so many volleys from harquebuses; and that other man, all covered with scars, wan, pale with hunger, determined to burst rather than open the gate to him: do you think they are in it for themselves? It could well be for someone they have never seen, someone plunged meanwhile in idleness and delights, who takes no interest in what they are doing. And this man over here, rheumy, filthy and blear-eyed, whom you can see coming out of his work-room at midnight! Do you think he is looking in his books for ways to be better, happier, wiser? Not a bit. He will teach posterity how to scan a verse of Plautus and how to spell a Latin word, or else die in the attempt.  
   <br>&emsp;Is there anyone not willing to barter health, leisure and life itself against reputation and glory, the most useless, vain and counterfeit coinage in circulation? Our own deaths have never frightened us enough, so let us burden ourselves with fears for the deaths of our wives, children and servants. Our own affairs have never caused us worry enough, so let us start cudgelling and tormenting our brains over those of our neighbours and ofthose whom we love. Should a man not prepare a settled place in his soul for something dearer than himself!  
   <br>&emsp;We have lived quite enough for others: let us live at least this tail-end of life for ourselves. Let us bring our thoughts and reflections back to ourselves and to our own well-being. Preparing securely for our own withdrawal is no light matter: it gives us enough trouble without introducing other concerns. Since God grants us leave to make things ready for our departure, let us prepare for it; let us pack up our bags and take leave of our company in good time; let us disentangle ourselves from those violent traps which pledge us to other things and which distance us from ourselves. We must unknot those bonds and, from this day forth, love this or that but marry nothing but ourselves. That is to say, let the rest be ours, but not so glued and joined to us that it cannot be pulled off without tearing away a piece of ourselves, skin and all. The greatest thing in the world is to know how to live to yourself.  
   <br>&emsp;It is time to slip our knots with society now that we can contribute nothing to it. A man with nothing to lend should refrain from borrowing. Our powers are failing: let us draw them in and keep them within ourselves. Whoever can turn round the duties of love and fellowship and pour them into himself should do so. In that decline which makes a man a useless encumbrance importunate to others, let him avoid becoming an encumbrance, importunate and useless to himself. Let him pamper himself, cherish himself, but above all control himself, so respecting his reason and so fearing his conscience that he cannot stumble in their presence without shame: It is rare for anybody to respect himself enough. Socrates says that youth must get educated; grown men employ themselves in good actions; old men withdraw from affairs, both civil and military, living as they please without being bound to any definite duties.  
   <br>&emsp;There are complexions more suited than others to these maxims about retirement. Those who hold on to things slackly and weakly, and whose will and emotions are choosy, accepting neither slavery nor employment easily – and I am one ofthem, both by nature and by conviction – will bend to this counsel better than those busy active minds which welcome everything with open arms, which take on everything, get carried away about everything and which are always giving themselves, offering themselves, putting themselves forward. When any good things happen to come to us from outside we should make use of them, so long as they remain pleasurable; we must not let them become our principal base, for they are no such thing: neither reason nor Nature will have them so. Why do we go against Nature’s laws and make our happiness a slave in the power of others?  
   <br>&emsp;Yet to go and anticipate the injuries of Fortune, depriving ourselves of such good things as are still in our grasp, as several have done out of devotion and a few philosophers out of rational conviction, making slaves of themselves, sleeping rough, poking out their own eyes, chucking their wealth into rivers, going about looking for pain – the first to acquire blessedness in the next life because of torment in this one, the others to ensure against tumbling afresh by settling for the bottom rung – are actions of virtue taken to excess. Let tougher sterner natures make even their hiding-places glorious and exemplary.     
   <br>&emsp;I have enough to do without going that far. When Fortune favours me, it is enough to prepare for her disfavour, picturing future ills in comfort, to the extent that my imagination can reach that far, just as we train ourselves in jousts and tournaments, counterfeiting war in the midst of peace. I do not reckon that Arcesilaus the philosopher had reformed his mind any the less because I know he used such gold and silver vessels as the state of his fortune allowed: for using them frankly and in moderation I hold him in greater esteem than if he had got rid of them.  
   <br>&emsp;I know how far our natural necessities can extend; and when I reflect that the indigent beggar at my door is often more merry and healthy than I am, I put myself firmly in his place and make an assay at giving my soul a slant like his. Then by runningsimilarly through other examples, though I may think that death, poverty, contempt and sickness are dogging my heels, I can readily resolve not to be terrified by what a man of lesser estate than mine can accept with such patience. I cannot believe that a base intelligence can do more than a vigorous one or that reason cannot produce the same effects as habit. And since I realize how insecure these adventitious comforts are, my sovereign supplication, which I never fail to make to God, is that, even while I enjoy them fully, He may make me content with myself and with such goods as are born within me. I know healthy young men who travel with a mass of pills in their baggage to swallow during an attack of rheum, fearing it less since they know they have a remedy to hand. That is the way to do it, only more so: if you know yourself subject to some grave affliction, equip yourself with medicines to benumb and deaden the part concerned.  
   <br>&emsp;The occupation we must choose for a life like this one should be neither toilsome nor painful (otherwise we should have vainly proposed seeking such leisure). It depends on each man’s individual taste. My taste is quite unsuited to managing my estates: those who do like it, should do it in moderation:  They should try to subordinate things to themselves, not themselves to things.  
   <br>&emsp;But let us just listen to the advice about solitude which Pliny the Younger gave to his friend Cornelius Rufus: ‘I counsel you in that ample and thriving retreat of yours, to hand the degrading and abject care of your estates over to those in your employ, and to devote yourself to the study of letters so as to derive from it something totally your own.’ By that, he means a good reputation, his humour being similar to Cicero’s whosaid he wanted to use his withdrawal and his repose from the affairs of State to gain life everlasting through his writings!  Does knowing mean nothing to you, unless somebody else knows that you know it?        
   <br>&emsp;It seems logical that when you talk about withdrawing from the world you should be contemplating things outside it; they only half do that: they do indeed arrange their affairs for when they will no longer be in the world, yet the fruits of their project they claim to draw from the world they have left: a ridiculous contradiction.  
   <br>&emsp;The thought of those who seek solitude for devotion’s sake, filling their minds with the certainty of God’s promises for the life to come, is much more sane and appropriate. Their objective is God, infinite in goodness and power: the soul can find there matters to slake her desires in perfect freedom. Pains and afflictions are profitable to them, being used to acquire eternal healing and joy; death is welcome as a passing over to that perfect state. The harshness of their Rule is smoothed by habit; their carnal appetites are rejected and lulled asleep by their denial – nothing maintains them but practising them and using them. Only this end, another life, blessedly immortal, genuinely merits our renunciation of the comforts and sweetnesses of this life of ours. Whoever can, in reality and constancy, set his soul ablaze with the fire of this lively faith and hope, builds in his solitude a life of choicest pleasures, beyond any other mode of life.  
   <br>&emsp;Neither the end, then, nor the means of Pliny’s counsel satisfy me: we are always jumping from feverish fits into burning agues. Spending time with books has its painful side like everything else and is equally inimical to health, which must be our main concern; we must not let our edge be blunted by the pleasure we take in books: it is the same pleasure as destroys the manager of estates, the miser, the voluptuary and the man of ambition.  
   <br>&emsp;The wise men teach us well to save ourselves from our treacherous appetites and to distinguish true wholesome pleasures from pleasures diluted and crisscrossed by pain. Most pleasures, they say, tickle and embrace us only to throttle us, like those thieves whom the Egyptians called Philistae. If a hangover came before we got drunk we would see that we never drank to excess: but pleasure, to deceive us, walks in front and hides her train. Books give pleasure: but if frequenting them eventually leads to loss of our finest accomplishments, joy and health, then give up your books. I am one whobelieves that their fruits cannot outweigh a loss such as that.  
   <br>&emsp;As men who have long felt weakened by illness in the end put themselves at the mercy of medicine and get that art to prescribe a definite diet never to be transgressed: so too a man who withdraws pained and disappointed with the common life must rule his life by a diet of reason, ordering it and arranging it with argument and forethought. He should have taken leave of toil and travail, no matter what face they present, and should flee from all kinds of passion which impede the tranquillity of his body and soul, and choose the way best suited to his humour. Let each man choose the road he should take.       
   <br>&emsp;Whether we are running our home or studying or hunting or following any other sport, we should go to the very boundaries of pleasure but take good care not to be involved beyond the point where it begins to be mingled with pain. We should retain just enough occupations and pursuits to keep ourselves fit and to protect ourselves from the unpleasantness which comes in the train of that other extreme: slack and inert idleness.  
   <br>&emsp;There are branches of learning both sterile and prickly, most of them made for the throng: they may be left to those who serve society. Personally I only like pleasurable easy books which tickle my interest, or those which console me and counsel me how to control my life and death.  
   
   <br>&emsp;Walking in silence through the healthy woods, pondering questions worthy of the wise and good.        
   
   <br>&emsp;Wiser men with a strong and vigorous soul can forge for themselves a tranquillity which is wholly spiritual. Since my soul is commonplace, I must help sustain myself with the pleasures of the body – and since age has lately robbed me of those more pleasing to my fancy I am training and sharpening my appetite for those which are left, more suited to my later season. We must cling tooth and claw to the use of the pleasures of this life which the advancing years, one after another, rip from our grasp. Carpamus dulcia; nostrum est Quod vivis: cinis et manes et fabula fies.  
   <br>&emsp;Let us pluck life’s pleasures: it is up to us to live; you will soon be ashes, a ghost, something to tell tales about.  
   <br>&emsp;As for glory – the end proposed by Pliny and Cicero – that is right outside my calculations. Ambition is the humour most contrary to seclusion. Glory and tranquillity cannot dwell in the same lodgings. As far as I can see, those authors have withdrawn only their arms and legs from the throng: their souls, their thoughts, remain even more bound up with it.  
   <br>&emsp;Now then, old chap, are you collecting bait to catch the ears of others? They step back only to make a better jump, and, with greater force, to make a lively charge through the troops of men.  
   <br>&emsp;Would you like to see how they fall just a tiny bit short of the target? Let us weigh against them the counsels of two philosophers – and from two different schools at that – one of them writing to his friend Idomeneus and the other to his friend Lucilius, to persuade them to give up the management of affairs of state and their great offices and to withdraw into solitude:  
   
   <br>&emsp;‘You have (they said) lived up to the present floating and tossing about; come away into the harbour and die. You have devoted your life to the light: devote what remains to obscurity. It is impossible to give up your pursuits if you do not give up their fruits. Renounce all concern for name and glory. There is the risk that the radiance of your former deeds may still cast too much light upon you and pursue you right into your lair. Among other gratifications give up the one which comes from other people’s approval. As for your learned intelligence, do not worry about that: it will not lose its effect if you yourself are improved by it. Remember the man who was asked why he toiled so hard at an art which few could ever know about: “For me a few are enough; one is enough; having none is enough.” He spoke the truth. You and one companion are audience enough for each other; so are you for yourself. For you, let the crowd be one, and one be a crowd. It is a vile ambition in one’s retreat to want to extract glory from one’s idleness. We must do like the beasts and scuff out our tracks at the entrance to our lairs. Youshould no longer be concerned with what the world says of you but with what you say to yourself. Withdraw into yourself, but first prepare yourself to welcome yourself there. It would be madness to entrust yourself to yourself, if you did not know how to govern yourself. There are ways of failing in solitude as in society. Make yourself into a man in whose sight you would not care to walk awry; feel shame for yourself and respect for yourself, – “observentur species honestae animo” let your mind dwell on examples of honour; until you do, always imagine that you are with Cato, Phocion and Aristides, in whose sight the very madmen would hide their faults; make them recorders of your inmost thoughts, which, going astray, will be set right again out of reverence for them.  
   <br>&emsp;‘The path they will keep you on is that of being contented with yourself, of borrowing all from yourself, of arresting and fixing your soul on thoughts contained within definite limits where she can find pleasure; then, having recognized those true benefits which we enjoy the more the more we know them, content yourself with them, without any desire to extend your life or fame.’  
   <br>&emsp;That is the advice of a philosophy which is natural and true, not like that of those other two, all verbiage and show.

<div class="content-text hidden" id="schoolmasters">
   When I was a schoolboy I was often upset when I saw schoolmasters treated as buffoons in Italian comedies – (and among us French the title of Magister can scarcely be said to imply much more respect). Placed as I was under their control and tutelage, the least I could do was to be jealous of their reputation. I tried to make excuses for them in terms of the natural conflict between the common man and men of rare judgement and outstanding learning – an inevitable one since their courses run flat opposite to each other. But the effort was wasted: it was the most civilized of men who held them in the greatest contempt; witness our excellent Du Bellay: 
   <div class="qu">But most of all I loathe schoolmasterish erudition</div>  
   As I grew older I found that they were absolutely right and that ‘them most biggest clerks ain’t the most wisest’. Yet how it can happen that a soul enriched by so much knowledge should not be more alert and alive, or that a grosser, commonplace spirit can without moral improvement lodge within itself the reasonings and judgements of the most excellent minds which the world has ever produced: that still leaves me wondering.  
   <br>&emsp;A young woman, the foremost of our Princesses, said to me of a particular man that, by welcoming in as he did the brains of others, so powerful and so numerous, his own brain was forced to squeeze up close, crouch down and contract in order to make room for them all! I would like to suggest that our minds are swamped by too much study and by too much matter just as plants are swamped by too much water or lamps by too much oil; that our minds, held fast and encumbered by so many diverse preoccupations, may well lose the means of struggling free, remaining bowed and bent under the load; except that it is quite otherwise: the more our souls are filled, the more they expand; examples drawn from far-off times show, on the contrary, that great soldiers and statesmen were also great scholars.  
   <br>&emsp;Those philosophers who did withdraw from all affairs of state were indeed mocked by the comic licence of their times since their opinions and manners made them look ridiculous: can you expect men like that to judge of rights in a law-suit or to judge a man’s deeds? How fit they are to do that, I must say! They are still trying to find out whether there is such a thing as life or motion; whether Man differs from Ox; what is meant by active and passive; what sort of creatures law and justice are! When they talk of or to a man in authority they show an uncouth and disrespectful licence. Do they hear a king or their own ruler praised? To them he is but an idle shepherd who spends his time exploiting his sheep’s wool and milk, only more harshly than a real shepherd does. Do you think a man may be more important because he possesses as his own a couple of thousand acres? They laugh at that, used as they are to treating the whole world as their own. Do you pride yourself on your nobility, since you reckon to have seven rich forebears? They do not think much of you: you have no conception of the universality of Nature – nor of the great many forebears each of us has – rich ones, poor ones, kings, lackeys, Greeks, Barbarians… Even if you were fiftieth in line from Hercules they would think you frivolous to value such a chance endowment. And so the common man despised them, as men who knew nothing about basic everyday matters or as men ignorant and presumptuous.  
   <br>&emsp;But that portrait drawn from Plato is far removed from what is lacking in the kind of people we are talking about. The others were envied for being above the common concerns, as being contemptuous of public duties, and as men who had constructed a way of life which was private, inimitable, governed by definite, high and unusual principles; the men we are talking about are despised as inferior to the common model, as incapable of public duties, as men dragging their lives and their base vile morals way behind the common sort of men.        
   <div class="qu">I hate men whose words are philosophical but whose deeds are base</div>  
   Those other philosophers, I say, were great in learning, greater still in activitiesof every kind. As in the tale of that geometrician of Syracuse who was interrupted in his contemplations in order to put some of them to practical use in the defence of his country: he set about at once producing frightful inventions, surpassing human belief; yet he himself despised the work of his hands, thinking that he had compromised the dignity of his art, of which his inventions were but apprentice-toys: so too with them; when they were at times put to the test of action they were seen to fly aloft on so soaring a wing that that it was clear that their understanding had indeed wondrously enriched their hearts and minds. But some, observing that the fortress of political power had been taken over by incompetents, withdrew: the man who asked Crates how long one had to go on philosophizing, was told, ‘Until our armies are no longer led by mule- drivers.’ Heraclitus made over his kingdom to his brother; and to the citizens of Ephesius who reproached him for spending his time playing with the children in front of the temple he retorted: ‘Is doing that not more worthwhile than sharing the control of affairs with the likes of you?’ Others, who had their thoughts set above the fortunes of this world, found the seats of Justice and the very thrones of kings to be base and vile: Empedocles rejected the offer of kingship made by the men of Agrigentum. When Thales condemned preoccupations with thrift and money- making he was accused of sour grapes like the fox. It pleased him, for fun, to make a revealing experiment; for this purpose he debased his knowledge in the service of profit and gain, setting up a business which in one year brought in as much wealth as the most experienced in the trade were hard put to match in a lifetime.  
   <br>&emsp;Aristotle tells of some people who called Thales, Anaxagoras and their like wise but not prudent, in that they did not concern themselves enough with the more useful matters; I cannot easily swallow that verbal distinction, but apart from that it provides no excuse for the people I am talking about: judging from the base and needy lot they are satisfied with, they are both not wise and not prudent.  
   <br>&emsp;But leaving aside this first explanation, I think it is better to say that the evil arises from their tackling the sciences in the wrong manner and that, from the way we have been taught, it is no wonder that neither master nor pupils become more able, even though they do know more. In truth the care and fees of our parents aim only at furnishing our heads with knowledge: nobody talks about judgement or virtue. When someone passes by, try exclaiming, ‘Oh, what a learned man!’ Then, when another does, ‘Oh, what a good man!’ Our people will not fail to turn their gaze respectfully towards the first. There ought to be a third man crying, ‘Oh, what blockheads!’  
   <br>&emsp;We readily inquire, ‘Does he know Greek or Latin?’ ‘Can he write poetry and prose?’ But what matters most is what we put last: ‘Has he become better and wiser?’We ought to find out not who understands most but who understands best. We work merely to fill the memory, leaving the understanding and the sense of right and wrong empty. Just as birds sometimes go in search of grain, carrying it in their beaks without tasting it to stuff it down the beaks of their young, so too do our schoolmasters go foraging for learning in their books and merely lodge it on the tip of their lips, only to spew it out and scatter it on the wind.  
   <br>&emsp;Such foolishness fits my own case marvellously well. Am I for the most part not doing the same when assembling my material? Off I go, rummaging about in books for sayings which please me – not so as to store them up (for I have no storehouses) but so as to carry them back to this book, where they are no more mine than they were in their original place. We only know, I believe, what we know now: ‘knowing’ no more consists in what we once knew than in what we shall know in the future.  
   <br>&emsp;But what is worse, their pupils and their little charges are not nourished and fed by what they learn: the learning is passed from hand to hand with only one end in view: to show it off, to put into our accounts to entertain others with it, as though it were merely counters, useful for totting up and producing statements, but having no other use or currency. They have learned how to talk with others, not with themselves: We do not need talk but helmsmanship.  
   <br>&emsp;Nature, to show that nothing beneath her sway is really savage, has brought forth among peoples whom art has least civilized things which rival the best that art can produce. There is a Gascon proverb, drawn from a country flute-song, which has just the right nuance for my purpose: ‘Puff and blow as you will: what concerns us is the movement of the fingers.’  
   <br>&emsp;We know how to say, ‘This is what Cicero said’; ‘This is morality for Plato’; ‘These are the ipsissima verba of Aristotle.’ But what have we got to say? What judgements do we make? What are we doing? A parrot could talk as well as we do.  
   <br>&emsp;Such behaviour puts me in mind of a rich Roman who had, at great expense, taken care to obtain the services of experts in all branches of learning; he kept them always about him so that, when some topic or other should happen to come up when he was with friends, each would bring supplies to his market, ready to furnish him with a brace of arguments or a verse bagged from Homer, depending on what kind of game they traded in. He thought that that knowledge was his because it was in the heads of people who were in his pay – as is the case of those men whose learned abundance consists in owning sumptuous libraries. Whenever I ask a certain acquaintance of mine to tell me what he knows about anything, he wants to show me a book: he would not venture to tell me that he has scabs on his arse without studying his lexicon to find out the meanings of scab and of arse.  
   <br>&emsp;All we do is to look after the opinions and learning of others: we ought to make them our own. We closely resemble a man who, needing a fire, goes next door to get a light, finds a great big blaze there and stays to warm himself, forgetting to take a brand back home. What use is it to us to have a belly full of meat if we do not digest it, if we do not transmute it into ourselves, if it does not make us grow in size and strength? Do we imagine that Lucullus, whom reading, not experience, made and fashioned into so great a captain, treated reading as we do? We allow ourselves to lean so heavily on other men’s arms that we destroy our own force. Do I wish to fortify myself against fear of death? Then I do it at Seneca’s expense. Do I want to console myself or somebody else? Then I borrow from Cicero: I would have drawn it from my own resources if only I had been made to practise doing so. I have no love for such competence as is borne off and begged. Learned we may be with another man’s learning: we can only be wise with wisdom of our own:  
   <div class="qu">I hate a sage who is not wise for himself </div>
   ‘We must not only obtain Wisdom: we must enjoy her.’ Dionysius used to laugh at professors of grammar who did research into the bad qualities of Ulysses yet knew nothing of their own; at musicians whose flutes were harmonious but not their morals; at orators whose studies led to talking about justice, not to being just.  
   <br>&emsp;If our souls do not move with a better motion and if we do not have a healthierjudgement, then I would just as soon that our pupil should spend his time playing tennis: at least his body would become more agile. But just look at him after he has spent some fifteen or sixteen years studying: nothing could be more unsuited for employment. The only improvement you can see is that his Latin and Greek have made him more conceited and more arrogant than when he left home. He ought to have brought back a fuller soul: he brings back a swollen one; instead of making it weightier he has merely blown wind into it.  
   <br>&emsp;These Magisters (as Plato says of their cousins, the Sophists) are unique in promising to be the most useful of men while being the only ones who not only fail to improve what is entrusted to them (yet carpenters or masons do so) but actually make it worse. And then they charge you for it.  
   <br>&emsp;Were we to accept the terms put forward by Protagoras – that either he should be paid his set fee or else his pupils should declare on oath in the temple what profit they reckoned they had gained from what he had taught them and remunerate him accordingly – these pedagogues of mine would be in for a disappointment if they had to rely on oaths based upon my experience.  
   <br>&emsp;In my local Périgord dialect these stripling savants are amusingly called Lettreferits (‘word-struck’), as though their reading has given them, so to speak, a whack with a hammer. In truth, as often as not they appear to have been knocked below common-sense itself. Take a peasant or a cobbler: you can see them going simply and innocently about their business, talking only of what they know: whereas these fellows, who want to rise up and fight armed with knowledge which is merely floating about on the surface of their brains, are for ever getting snarled up and entangled. Fine words break loose from them: but let somebody else apply them! They know their Galen but not their patient. They stuff your head full of prescriptions before they even understand what the case is about. They have learned the theory of everything: try and find one who can put it into practice.  
   <br>&emsp;In my own house a friend of mine had to deal with one of these fellows; he amused himself by coining some nonsensical jargon composed of disconnected phrases and borrowed passages, but often interlarded with terms bearing on their discussion: he kept the fool arguing for one whole day, thinking all the time that he was answering objections put before him. Yet he had a reputation for learning – and a fine gown, too.
   <br>&emsp;Whoever will look closely at persons of this sort – and they are spread about everywhere – will find as I do that for the most part they understand neither themselves nor anyone else and that while their memory is very full their judgement remains entirely hollow – unless their own nature has fashioned it for them otherwise, as I saw in the case of Adrian Turnebus who had no other profession but letters (in which he was, in my opinion, the greatest man for a millennium) yet who had nothing donnish about him except the way he wore his gown and some superficial mannerisms which might not be elegant al Cortegiano but which really amount to nothing. And I loathe people who find it harder to put up with a gown askew than with a soul askew and who judge a man by by his bow, his bearing and his boots. For, within, Turnebus was the most polished of men. I often intentionally tossed him into subjects remote from his experience: his insight was so lucid, his grasp so quick and his judgement so sound that it would seem that he had never had any other business but war or statecraft.  Natures like that are fair and strong:  
   <div class="qu">Whose minds are made by Titan with gracious art and from a better clay </div>       
   When our Courts of Parliament have to admit magistrates, some examine only their learning: others also make a practical assay of their ability by giving them a case to judge. The latter seem to me to have the better procedure, and even though both those are necessary and both needed together, nevertheless the talent for knowledge is less to be prized than that for judging. Judgement can do without knowledge: but not knowledge without judgement. It is what that Greek verse says: – ‘what use is knowledge if there is no understanding?’ Would to God for the goodof French justice that those Societies should prove to be as well furnished with understanding and integrity as they still are with knowledge! We are taught for the schoolroom not for life.  
   <br>&emsp;Now we are not merely to stick knowledge on to the soul: we must incorporate it into her; the soul should not be sprinkled with knowledge but steeped in it. And if knowledge does not change her and make her imperfect state better then it is preferable just to leave it alone. Knowledge is a dangerous sword; in a weak hand which does not know how to wield it it gets in its master’s way and wounds him, so that it would have been better not to have studied at all.  
   <br>&emsp;Perhaps that is why we French do not require much learning in our wives (nor does Theology) and why, when Francis Duke of Brittany, the son of John V, was exploring the possibility of a marriage to Isabella, a princess of Scotland, and was told that she had been brought up simply and never taught to read, he replied that he liked her all the better for it and that a wife is learned enough when she can tell the difference between her husband’s undershirt and his doublet. And it is not as great a wonder as they proclaim it to be that our forebears thought little of book-learning and that even now it is only found by chance in the chief councils of our monarchs; for without the unique goal which is actually set before us (that is, to get rich by means of jurisprudence, medicine, paedagogy, and Theology too, a goal which does keep such disciplines respected) you would see them still as wretched as they ever were. If they teach us neither to think well nor to act well, what have we lost? Now that so many are learned, it is good men that we lack. All other knowledge is harmful in a man who has no knowledge of what is good.  
   <br>&emsp;But the reason that I was looking for just now, could it not also arise from the fact that since studies in France have virtually no other end than the making of money, few of those whom nature has begotten for duties noble rather than lucrative devote themselves to learning; or else they do so quite briefly, withdrawing (before having acquired a taste for learning) to a profession which has nothing in common with books; normally there are few left to devote themselves entirely to study except people with no money, who do strive to make their living from it. And the souls of people like that – souls of the basest alloy by nature, by their home upbringing and by example – bear but the false fruits of knowledge. For learning sheds no light on a soul which lacks it; it cannot make a blind man see: her task is not to furnish him with sight but to train his own and to put it through its paces – if, that is, it has legs and hoofs which are sound and capable.  
   <br>&emsp;Learning is a good medicine: but no medicine is powerful enough to preserve itself from taint and corruption independently of defects in the jar that it is kept in. One man sees clearly but does not see straight: consequently he sees what is good but fails to follow it; he sees knowledge and does not use it. The main statute of Plato in his Republic is to allocate duties to his citizens according to their natures. Nature can do all, does do all: the lame are not suited to physical exercises, nor are lame souls suited to spiritual ones: misbegotten and vulgar souls are unworthy of philosophy. When we see a man ill-shod, we are not surprised when he turns out to be a cobbler! In the same way it would seem that experience often shows us that doctors are the worst doctored, theologians the most unreformed and the learned the least able.  
   <br>&emsp;In Ancient times Ariston of Chios was right to say that philosophers do harm to their hearers, since most souls are incapable of profiting from such teaching, which when it cannot do good turns to bad: debauchees come from the school of Aristippus; little savages from Zeno’s.  
   <br>&emsp;In that excellent education that Xenophon ascribed to the Persians, we find that they taught their children to be virtuous, just as other peoples teach theirs to read. Plato says that the eldest son in their royal succession was brought up as follows: at birth he was entrusted not to women but to eunuchs holding highest authority in the king’s entourage on account of their virtue. They accepted responsibility for making his body fair and healthy; when he was seven they instructed him in riding and hunting. When he reached fourteen they placed him into the hands of four men: the wisest man, the most just man, the most temperate man and the most valiant man in all that nation. The first taught him religion; the second, to be ever true; the third to be master of his desires; the fourth to fear nothing.  
   <br>&emsp;It is a matter worthy of the highest attention that in that excellent constitution which was drawn up by Lycurgus and was truly prodigious in its perfection, the education of the children was the principal duty, yet little mention was made of instruction even in the domain of the Muses; it was as though those great-hearted youths despised any yoke save that of virtue, so that they had to be provided not with Masters of Arts but Masters of Valour, of Wisdom and of Justice – an example followed by Plato in his Laws. Their mode of teaching consisted in posing questions about the judgements and deeds of men: if the pupils condemned or praised this or that person or action, they had to justify their statement: by this means they both sharpened their understanding and learned what is right.  
   <br>&emsp;In Xenophon, Astiages asked Cyrus for an account of his last lesson. ‘In our school,’ he said, ‘a big boy had a tight coat; he took a coat away from a classmate of slighter build, because it was on the big side, and gave” him his. Teacher made me judgeof their quarrel and I judged that things were best left as they were, since both of them were better off by what had been done. He then showed me that I had judged badly, since I had confined myself to considering what seemed better, whereas I should first have dealt with justice, which requires that no one should be subjected to force over things which belonged to him.’ He then said he was beaten, just as we are in our village schools for forgetting the first aorist of tupt ‘I thrash’. (A dominie would have to treat me to a fine harangue in the demonstrative mode before he would convince me that his school was worth that one!) Those Persians wanted to shorten the journey, and since it is true that study, even when done properly, can only teach us what wisdom, right conduct and determination consist in, they wanted to put their children directly in touch with actual cases, teaching them not by hearsay but by actively assaying them, vigorously moulding and forming them not merely by word and precept but chiefly by deeds and examples, so that wisdom should not be something which the soul knows but the soul’s very essence and temperament, not something acquired but a natural property.  
   <br>&emsp;While on this subject, when Agesilaus was asked what he thought should be taught to children he replied, ‘What they should do when they are grown up.’ No wonder that education such as that should have produced such astonishing results. They used to go to other Grecian cities in search of rhetoricians, painters and musicians: the others came to Sparta for lawgivers, statesmen and generals. In Athens they learned to talk well: here, to act well; there, to unravel sophistries and set at nought the hypocrisy of words craftily intertwined; here, to free themselves from the snares of pleasure and to set at nought great-heartedly the menaces of fortune and of death; the Athenians were occupied with words: the Spartans with things; there, it was the tongue which was kept in continuous training; here, there was a continuous training of the soul. That is why it was not odd that when Antipater demanded fifty of their sons as hostages they replied (quite the opposite to what we would) that they preferred to give twice as many grown-up men, so high a value did they place on depriving the boys of their national education. When Agesilaus urged Xenophon to send his sons to be brought up in Sparta, it was not to learn rhetoric there nor dialectic but, he said, to learn the finest subject of all: namely how to obey and how to command.  
   <br>&emsp;It is most pleasing to see Socrates in his own way poking fun at Hippias, who was telling him how he had earned a great sum of money as a schoolmaster in some little towns in Sicily whereas he could not earn a penny in Sparta since Spartans are stupid people who cannot measure or count, who do not esteem grammar or prosody, merely spending their time learning by heart the list of their kings, stories about the founding and decline of states and similar nonsense. When he had finished Socrates, by bringing him to admit in detail the excellence of the Spartans’ political constitution andthe happiness and virtue of their lives, let him anticipate his conclusion: that it was his own arts which were quite useless.  
   <br>&emsp;Both in that martial government and in all others like it examples show that studying the arts and sciences makes hearts soft and womanish rather than teaching them to be firm and ready for war. The strongest State to make an appearance in our time is that of the Turks; and the Turkish peoples are equally taught to respect arms and to despise learning. I find that Rome was more valiant in the days before she became learned. In our time the most warlike nations are the most rude and ignorant: the Scythians, the Parthians and Tamburlane serve to prove that. When the Goths sacked Greece, what saved their libraries from being burned was the idea spread by one of the marauders that such goods should be left intact for their enemies: they had the property of deflecting them from military exercises while making them spend time on occupations which were sedentary and idle.  
   <br>&emsp;When our own King Charles V found himself master of the kingdom of Naples and of a large part of Tuscany without even drawing his sword, he attributed such unhoped for ease of conquest to the fact that the Italian princes and nobility spent more time becoming clever and learned than vigorous and soldierly.

<div class="content-text hidden" id="OnEducation">
   I have never known a father fail to acknowledge his son as his own, no matter how scurvy or crook-backed he may be . It is not that he fails to see his infirmities (unless he is quite besotted by his affection): but the thing is his, for all that! The same applies to me: I can see - better than anyone else - that these writings of mine are no more than the ravings of a man who has never done more than taste the outer crust of knowledge - even that was during his childhood - and who has retained only an ill-formed generic notion of it: a little about everything and nothing about anything, in the French style. For, in brief, I do know that there is such a thing as medicine and jurisprudence; that there are four parts to mathematics: and I know more or less what they cover. (Perhaps I do also know how the sciences in general claim to serve us in our lives.) But what I have definitely not done is to delve deeply into them, biting my nails over the study of Aristotle , that monarch of Modernists. I could not sketch even the mere outlines of any art whatsoever; there is no boy even in the junior forms who cannot say he is more learned than I am: I could not even test him on his first lesson, at least not in detail. When forced to do so, I am constrained to extract (rather ineptly) something concerning universals, against which I test his inborn judgement - a subject as unknown to the boys as theirs is to me.  
   <br>&emsp;I have fashioned no sustained intercourse with any solid book except Plutarch and Seneca; like the Danai’des I am constantly dipping into them and then pouring out: I spill some of it on to this paper but next to nothing on to me. My game-bag is made for history rather, or poetry, which I love, being particularly inclined towards it ; for (as Cleanthes said) just as the voice of the trumpet rings out clearer and stronger for being forced through a narrow tube so too a saying leaps forth much more vigorously when compressed into the rhythms of poetry, striking me then with a livelier shock.        
   <br>&emsp;As for my own natural faculties which are being assayed here, I can feel them bending beneath their burden. My concepts and judgement can only fumble their way forward, swaying, stumbling, tripping over; even when I have advanced as far as I can, I never feel satisfied, for I have a troubled cloudy vision of lands beyond, which I cannot make out. I undertake to write without preconceptions on any subject which comes to mind, employing nothing but my own natural resources: then if (as happens often) I chance to come across in excellent authors the very same topics I have undertaken to treat, I acknowledge myself to be so weak, so paltry, so lumbering and so dull compared with such men, that I feel scorn and pity for myself. I do congratulate myself, however, that my opinions frequently coincide with theirs and on the fact that I do at least trail far behind them murmuring ‘Hear, hear’. And again, I do know (what many do not) the vast difference there is between them and me. What I myself have thought up and produced is poor feeble stuff, but I let it go on, without plastering over the cracks or stitching up the rents which have been revealed by such comparisons . You need a strong backbone if you undertake to march shoulder to shoulder with fellows like that.  
   <br>&emsp;Those rash authors of our own century who scatter whole passages from ancient writers throughout their own worthless works, seeking to acquire credit thereby, achieve the reverse; between them and the Ancients there is an infinite difference of lustre, which gives such a pale sallow ugly face to their own contributions that they lose far more than they gain.        
   <br>&emsp;There were two opposing concepts. Chrysippus the philosopher intermingled not merely passages from other authors into his writings but entire books: in one he cited the whole of the Medea of Euripides! Apollodorus said that if you cut out his borrowings his paper would remain blank. Epicurus on the other hand left three hundred tomes behind him: not one quotation from anyone else was planted in any of them.       
   <br>&emsp;The other day I chanced upon such a borrowing. I had languished along behind some French words, words so bloodless, so fleshless and so empty of matter that indeed they were nothing but French and nothing but words. At the end of a long and boring road I came upon a paragraph which was high, rich, soaring to the clouds. If I had found a long gentle slope leading up to it, that would have been pardonable: what I came across was a cliff surging up so straight and so steep that I knew I was winging my way to another world after the first half-a-dozen words. That was how I realized what a slough I had been floundering through beforehand, so base and so deep that I did not have the heart to sink back into it.       
   <br>&emsp;Be that as it may; I mean that whatever these futilities of mine may be, I have no intention of hiding them, any more than I would a bald and grizzled portrait of myself just because the artist had painted not a perfect face but my own.  
   <div class="qu">These are my humours, my opinions: I give them as things which I believe, not as things to be believed. My aim is to reveal my own self, which may well be different tomorrow if I am initiated into some new business which changes me. I have not, nor do I desire, enough authority to be believed. I feel too badly taught to teach others </div>
   Now in my home the other day somebody read the previous chapter and told me that I ought to spread myself a bit more on the subject of children’s education. If, My Lady, I did have some competence in this matter I could not put it to better use than to make a present of it to that little man who is giving signs that he is soon to make a gallant sortie out of you. (You are too great-souled to begin other than with a boy.) Having played so large a part in arranging your marriage I have a rightful concern for the greatness and prosperity of all that springs from it, quite apart from that long enjoyment you have had of my service to you, by which I am indeed bound to desire honour, wealth and success to anything that touches on you. But in truth I know nothing about education except this: that the greatest and the most important difficulty known to human learning seems to lie in that area which treats how to bring up children and how to educate them.  
   <br>&emsp;It is just as in farming: the ploughing which precedes the planting is easy and sure; so is the planting itself: but as soon as what is planted springs to life, the raising of it is marked by a great variety of methods and difficulty. So too with human beings; it is not much trouble to plant them, but as soon as they are born we take on in order to form them and bring them up a diversity of cares, full of bustle and worry. When they are young they give such slight and obscure signs of their inclinations, while their promises are so false and unreliable, that it is hard to base any solid judgement upon them. Look at Cimon, Themistocles and hundreds of others; think how unlike themselves they used to be!  Bear-cubs and puppies manifest their natural inclinations but humans immediately acquire habits, laws and opinions; they easily change or adopt disguises.  
   <br>&emsp;It is so hard to force a child’s bend though. That explains why, having chosen the wrong route, we toil to no avail and often waste years training children for occupations in which they never achieve anything. All the same my opinion is that, faced by this difficulty, we should always guide them towards the best and most rewarding goals, and that we should attach little importance to those trivial prognostications and foretellings we base on their childish actions. Even Plato seems to me to give too much weight to them in his Republic. Learning, My Lady, is a great ornament and a useful instrument of wondrous service, especially in those who are fortunate to live in so high an estate as yours. And in truth she does not find her true employment in hands base and vile. She is far more proud to deploy her resources for the conducting of a war, the commanding of a nation and the winning of the affection of a prince or of a foreign people than for drawing up dialectical arguments, pleading in a court of appeal or prescribing a mass of pills.  
   <br>&emsp;And, therefore, My Lady, since I believe you will not overlook this aspect of the education of your children, you who have yourself tasted its sweetness and who belong to a family of authors , I want to tell you of one thought of mine which runs contrary to normal practice. This will be all I am able to contribute to in this matter.         
   <br>&emsp;The responsibilities of the tutor you give your son (and the results of the education he provides depend on your choice of him) comprise many other elements which I do not touch upon since I have nothing worthwhile to contribute; as for the one subject on which I do undertake to give him my advice,  will only accept what I say insofar as it seems convincing to him.  
   <br>&emsp;The son of the house is seeking book-learning, not to make money or external advantage, rather to seek riches which are truly his own, those which inwardly enrich and adorn him. Since I would prefer that he turned out to be an able man not an erudite one, I would wish you to be careful to select as guide for him a tutor with a well-formed rather than a well- filled brain. Let both be looked for, but place character and intelligence before knowledge; and let him carry out his responsibilities in a new way.  
   <br>&emsp;Teachers are for ever bawling into our ears as though pouring knowledge down through a funnel ; our task is merely to repeat what we have been told. I would want our tutor to put that right: as soon as the mind in his charge allows it, he should make it show its fettle by appreciating and selecting things - and by distinguishing between them; the tutor should sometimes prepare the way for the boy, sometimes let him do it all on his own. I do not want the tutor to be the only one to choose topics or to do all the talking: when the boy’s turn comes let the tutor listen to his pupil talking. Socrates and then Archesilaus used to make their pupils speak first; they spoke afterwards.         
   <div class="qu">For those who want to learn, the obstacle can often be the authority of those who teach </div> 
   It is good to make him trot in front of his tutor in order to judge his paces and to judge how far down the tutor needs to go to adapt himself to his ability. If we get that proportion wrong we spoil everything; knowing how to find it and to remain well-balanced within it is one of the most arduous tasks there is. It is the action of a powerful elevated mind to know how to come down to the level of the child and to guide his footsteps. Personally I go uphill more firmly and surely than down. Those who follow our French practice and undertake to act as schoolmaster for several minds diverse in kind and capacity, using the same teaching and the same degree of guidance for them all, not surprisingly can scarcely find in a whole tribe of children more than one or two who bear fruit from their education.  
   <br>&emsp;Let the tutor not merely require a verbal account of what the boy has been taught but the meaning and the substance of it: let him judge how the child has profited from it not from the evidence of his memory but from that of his life. Let him take what the boy has just learned and make him show him dozens of different aspects of it and then apply it to just as many different subjects, in order to find out whether he has really grasped it and made it part of himself, judging the boy’s progress by what Plato taught about education : Spewing up food exactly as you have swallowed it is evidence of a failure to digest and assimilate it; the stomach has not done its job if, during concoction, it fails to change the substance and the form of what it is given.         
   <br>&emsp;Our souls are moved only at second-hand, being shackled and constrained to what is desired by someone else’s ideas; they are captives, enslaved to the authority of what they have been taught. We have been so subjected to leading-reins that we take no free steps on our own. Our drive to be free has been quenched. “They are never free from tutelage.” In Pisa I met, in private, a decent man who is such an Aristotelian that the most basic of his doctrines is that the touchstone and the measuring-scale of all sound ideas and of each and every truth lie in their conformity with the teachings of Aristotle, outside of which all is inane and chimerical: Aristotle has seen everything, done everything.         
   <br>&emsp;Let the tutor pass everything through a filter and never lodge anything in the boy’s head simply by authority, at second-hand. Let the principles of Aristotle not be principles for him any more than those of the Stoics or Epicureans. Let this diversity of judgements be set before him; if he can, he will make a choice: if he cannot then he will remain in doubt.  
   <div class="qu">Only fools have made up their minds</div>
   If it is by his own reasoning that he adopts the opinions of Xenophon and Plato, they are no longer theirs, they are his. To follow another is to follow nothing: “We are under no king when it comes to this; let each man act freely.” Let him at least know what he does know.  
   <br>&emsp;He should not be learning their precepts but drinking in their humours. If he wants to, let him not be afraid to forget where he got them from, but let him be sure that he knows how to appropriate them. Truth and reason are common to all: they no more belong to the man who first put them into words than to him who last did so. It is no more secundum Platonem than secundum me : Plato and I see and understand it the same way. Bees ransack flowers here and flowers there: but then they make their own honey, which is entirely theirs and no longer thyme or marjoram. Similarly the boy will transform his borrowings; he will confound their forms so that the end-product is entirely his: namely, his judgement, the forming of which is the only aim of his toil, his study and his education.        
   <br>&emsp;Let him hide the help he received and put only his achievements on display. Pillagers and borrowers make a parade of what they have bought and built not of what they have filched from others! You never see the ‘presents’ given to a Parliamentary lawyer: what you see are the honours which he obtains for his children, and the families they marry into. Nobody puts his income on show, only his possessions. The profit we possess after study is to have become better and wiser.        
   <br>&emsp;As Epicharmus said, that which sees and hears is our understanding; it is our understanding which benefits all, which arranges everything, which acts, which is Master and which reigns . We indeed make it into a slave and a coward by not leaving it free to do anything of itself. Which tutor ever asks his pupil what he thinks about rhetoric or grammar or this or that statement of Cicero? They build them into our memory, panelling and all, as though they were oracles, in which letters and syllables constitute the actual substance. ‘Knowing’ something does not mean knowing it by heart; that simply means putting it in the larder of our memory. That which we rightly ‘know’ can be deployed without looking back at the model, without turning our eyes back towards the book. What a wretched ability it is which is purely and simply bookish! Book-learning should serve as an ornament not as a foundation - following the conclusion of Plato that true philosophy consists in resoluteness, faithfulness and purity, whereas the other sciences, which have other aims, are merely cosmetic.  
   <br>&emsp;Take Palvel and Pompeo, those excellent dancing-masters form my earlier years: I would like to have seen them teaching us our steps just by watching them without budging from our seats, like those teachers who seek to give instruction to our understanding without making it dance - or to have seen others teach us how to manage a horse, a pike or a lute, or a tune with no practice, as these fellows do who want to teach us to judge well and to speak well but who never give us exercises in judging or speaking.  
   <br>&emsp;Yet for such an apprenticeship everything we see can serve as an excellent book: some cheating by a page, some stupidity on the part of a lackey, something said at table, all supply new material.        
   <br>&emsp;For this purpose mixing with people is wonderfully appropriate. So are visits to foreign lands: but not the way the French nobles do it (merely bringing back knowledge of how many yards long the Pantheon is, or of the rich embroidery on Signora Livia’s knickers); nor the way others do so (knowing how much longer and fatter Nero’s face is on some old ruin over there compared with his face on some comparable medallion) but mainly learning of the humours of those peoples and of their manners, and knocking off our comers by rubbing our brains against other people’s. I would like pupils to be taken abroad from their tenderest years, mainly (so as to kill two birds with one stone) to any neighbouring peoples whose languages, being least like our own, are ones which our tongue cannot get round unless you start bending it young. And, besides, it is a universally received opinion that it is not sensible to bring up a boy in the lap of his parents. Natural affection makes parents too soft, too indulgent - even the wisest of them. They are incapable of either punishing his faults or of bringing him up as roughly and as dangerously as he ought to be. They could not bear to see him riding back from his training all dirty and sweaty, drinking this hot, drinking that cold, nor to see him on a fractious horse, or up against a tough opponent foil in hand, nor with his first arquebus. But there is no other prescription: anyone who wants to be absolutely certain of making a real man of him must not spare his youth and must frequently flout the laws of medicine.  
   <div class="qu">Let him camp in the open, amidst war’s alarms</div>  
   Nor is it enough to toughen up his soul: you must also toughen up his muscles.- The Soul is too hard-pressed if she is not seconded. She has too much to do herself to think of taking on the duties of both. I know how my own soul groans in her fellowship with a body so soft and sensitive to pain and which relies too heavily on her; and I have noticed in my reading that in their writings my moral guides pass off as examples of greatness of soul or strength of mind things which really belong to a tough skin or to  
   <br>&emsp;strong bones. I have known men, women and children who are so constituted that a good beating means less to them than a pinch does to me, and who stir neither tongue nor eyebrow under the blows. When athletes play the philosopher in endurance it is strength of muscle rather than strength of mind.  
   <br>&emsp;Now learning to endure toil is learning to endure pain: “toil puts callouses on our minds, against pain.” Pain and discomfort in training are needed to break him in for the pain and discomfort of dislocated joints, of the stone and of cauterizings - and of dungeons and tortures as well for, seeing the times we live in, those two may concern the good man as much as the bad. We are experiencing that now: whoever bears arms against Law threatens the best of men with the cat-o’-nine-tails and the rope.         
   <br>&emsp;And then the authority of the tutor, which must be sovereign for the boy, is hampered and interrupted by the presence of his parents. Add to which the respect paid to the boy by his household and his awareness of the resources and dignity of his family are not in my opinion trivial disadvantages at that particular age. Yet in the school of conversation among men I have often noticed a perversion: instead of learning about others we labour only to teach them about ourselves and are more concerned to sell our own wares than to purchase new ones.  
   <br>&emsp;In our commerce with others, silence and modesty are most useful qualities. Train the lad to be sparing and reticent about his accomplishments (when he eventually has any) and he will not take umbrage when unlikely tales and daft things are related in his presence - for it is unmannerly and impolite to criticize everything which is not to our liking. Let him be satisfied with correcting himself without being seen to reproach others for doing things he would not do himself and without flouting public morality: “One should be wise without ostentation or ill-will.”  
   <br>&emsp;Let him shun any semblance of impolitely laying down the law, as well as that puerile ambition to wish to appear clever by being different or to earn a name for criticizing or flaunting novelties. It is only appropriate for great poets freely to break the rules of poetry: similarly it is intolerable for any but great and illustrious souls to give themselves unaccustomed prerogatives: “Although Socrates and Aristippus sometimes flouted normal rules and customs, one should not feel free to do the same: they obtained that privilege by qualities great and sublime.”  
   <br>&emsp;The boy will be taught not to get into a discussion or a quarrel except when he finds a sparring-partner worth wrestling with - and even then not to employ all the holds which might help him but merely those which help him most. Teach him a certain refinement in sorting out and selecting his arguments, with an affection for relevance and so for brevity. Above all let him be taught to throw down his arms and surrender to truth as soon as he perceives it, whether that truth is born at his rival’s doing or within himself from some change in his ideas. He will never be up in a pulpit reading out some prescribed text: he only has to defend a case when it has his approbation. He is not going to take up the kind of profession in which freedom to think again, or to admit mistakes, has been traded for ready cash. “He is under no obligation to support all precepts and assertion.” 
   <br>&emsp;Let our pupil’s talk be shined through virtue and wisdom, guided by reason, so to reach what is right and wrong. Make him understand that confessing an error which he discovers in his own argument even when he alone has noticed it is an act of justice and integrity, which are the main qualities he pursues; stubbornness and rancour are vulgar qualities, visible in common souls whereas to think again, to change one’s mind and to give up a bad case in the heat of the argument are rare qualities showing strength and magnanimity         
   <br>&emsp;When in society the boy will be told to keep his eyes open: I find that the front seats are normally taken as a right by the less able men and that great inherited wealth is hardly ever associated with ability; while at the top end of the table the talk was about the beauty of a tapestry or the bouquet of the malmsey, I have known many witty remarks at the other end pass unnoticed. He will sound out the capacity of each person: of a herdsman, a mason, a wayfarer: he must use what he can get, take what a man has to sell and see that nothing goes wasted: even other people’s stupidity and weakness serve to instruct him. By noting each man’s endowments and habits, there will be engendered in him a desire for the good ones and a contempt for the bad.  
   <br>&emsp;Put into his mind a decent, careful spirit of inquiry about everything: he will go and see anything nearby which is of singular quality: a building, a fountain, a man, the site of an old battle, a place which Caesar or Charlemagne passed through: ”what land is benumbed with the cold, which dusty with heat, which favourable winds blow sails towards Italian coasts.” He will inquire into the habits, means and alliances of various monarchs, things most pleasant to study and most useful to know. In his commerce with men I mean him to include - and that principally - those who live only in the memory of books. By means of history he will frequent those great souls of former years. If you want it to be so, history can be a waste of time: it can also be, if you want it to be so, a study bearing fruit beyond price - the only study, Plato said, which the Spartans kept as their share.  
   <br>&emsp;Remain clear though to the aim of our tutor and the object of his trust, which is less to stamp the date of the fall of Carthage on the boy as the behaviour of Hannibal and Scipio; less to stamp the name of the place where Marcellus died as how his death there showed him unworthy of his task. Let him not so much learn what happened as judge what happened, keeping profit for his own, for formation instead of credit”  
   <br>&emsp;That, if you ask me, is the subject to which our wits are applied in the most diverse of manners. I have read hundreds of things in Livy which another has not found there. Plutarch found in him hundreds of things which I did not see (and which perhaps the author never put there). For some Livy is purely a grammatical study; for others he is philosophy dissected, penetrating into the most abstruse parts of our nature. There are in Plutarch developed treatises very worth knowing, for he is to my mind the master-craftsman at that job; but there are also hundreds of points which he simply touches on: he merely flicks his fingers towards the way we should go if we want to, or at times he contents himself with a quick shot at the liveliest part of the subject: those passages we must rip out and put out on display. For example that one saying of his, ‘that the inhabitants of Asia were slaves of one tyrant because they were incapable of pronouncing one syllable: NO,’ may have furnished La Boetie with the matter and moment of his book De la Servitude volontaire.— Seeing Plutarch select a minor action in the life of a man, or an apparently unimportant saying, is worth a treatise in itself.  
   <br>&emsp;It is a pity that intelligent men are so fond of brevity: by it their reputation is certainly worth all the more, but we are worth all the less. Plutarch would rather we vaunted his judgement than his knowledge, and he would rather leave us craving for more than bloated. He realized that you could say too much even on a good subject, and that Alexandridas rightly criticized the orator whose address to the ephors was good but too long, saying, ‘Oh, Stranger, you say what you should, but not the way that you should!’- People whose bodies are too thin pad them out: those whose matter is too slender pad it out too, with words.   
   <br>&emsp;Frequent commerce with the world can be an astonishing source of light for a man’s judgement. We are all cramped and confined inside ourselves: we can see no further than the end of our noses. When they asked Socrates where he came from he did not say ‘From Athens’, but ‘From the world’. He, whose thoughts were fuller and wider, embraced the universal world as his City, scattered his acquaintances, his fellowship and his affections throughout the whole human race, not as we do who only look at what lies right in front of us. When frost attacks the vines in my village my parish priest talks of God being angry against the human race: in his judgement the Cannibals are already dying of the croup! At the sight of our civil wars, who fails to exclaim that the world is turned upside down and that the Day of Judgement has got us by the throat, forgetting that many worse events have been known in the past and that, in thousands of parts of the world, they are still having a fine old time! Personally I am surprised that our wars turn out to be so mild and gentle, given their unpunished licentiousness. When the hail beats down on your head the entire hemisphere seems stormy and tempestuous. Like that peasant of Savoy who said that if only that silly King of France had known how to use his luck properly he could have become the Duke’s chief steward eventually! His mind could not conceive of any degree of grandeur above that of his Duke. We are all caught in that same error without realizing it: a harmful error of great consequence. Only a man who can picture in his mind the mighty idea of Mother Nature in her total majesty; who can read in her countenance a variety so general and so unchanging and then pick out therein not merely himself but an entire kingdom as a tiny, feint point: only he can reckon things at their real size. This great world of ours (which for some is only one species within a generic group) is the looking-glass in which we must gaze to come to know ourselves from the right slant.  
   <br>&emsp;To sum up then, I want it to be the book which our pupil studies. Such a variety of humours, schools of thought, opinions, laws and customs teach us to judge sanely of our own and teach our judgement to acknowledge its shortcomings and natural weakness. And that is no light apprenticeship. So many revolutions, so many changes in the fortune of a state, teach us to realize that our own fortune is no great miracle. So many names, so many victories and conquests lying buried in oblivion, make it ridiculous to hope that we shall immortalize our names by rounding up ten armed brigands or by storming some hen-house or other known only by its capture. The proud arrogance of so many other nations’ pomp and the high-flown majesty of the grandeur of so many courts strengthen our gaze to look firmly and assuredly, without blinking, at the brilliance of our own. So many millions upon millions of men dead and buried before us encourage us not to be afraid of going to join such a goodly company in the world to come. And so on.  
   <br>&emsp;Our life, said Pythagoras , is like the vast throng assembled for the Olympic Games: some use their bodies there to win fame from the contests; others come to trade, to make a profit; still others - and they are by no means the worst - seek no other gain than to be spectators, seeing how everything is done and why; they watch how other men live so that they can judge and regulate their own lives. All the most profitable treatises of philosophy (which ought to be the touchstone and measure of men’s actions) can be properly reduced to examples. Teach the boy this: what he may justly wish for; that money is hard to earn and should be used properly; the extent of our duty to our country and to our dear ones; what God orders you to be, and what place He has assigned to you in the scheme of things; what we are and what we shall win when we have overcome;”     
   <br>&emsp;Teach him what knowing and not knowing means (which ought to be the aim of study); what valour is, and justice and temperance; what difference there is between ordinate and inordinate aspirations; slavery and due subordination; licence and liberty; what are the signs of true and solid happiness; how far we should fear death, pain and shame: “How we can flee from hardships and how we can endure them;”  
   <div class="qu">The first lessons with which we should irrigate his mind should be those which teach him to know himself, and to know how to die... and to live </div>
   Among the liberal arts, start with the art which produces liberal men. All of them are of some service in the regulation and practice of our lives, just as everything else is; but let us select the one which leads there directly and professes to do so. If we knew how to restrict our life’s appurtenances to their right and natural limits, we would discover that the greater part of the arts and sciences as now practised are of no practical use to us, and that, even in those which are useful, there are useless wastes and chasms which we would do better to leave where they are; following what Socrates taught, we should set limits to our study of subjects which lack utility. Dare to be wise. Start now. To put off the moment when you will start to live justly is to act like the bumpkin who would cross but who waits for the stream to dry up; time flows and will flow for ever, as an ever-rolling stream.”  
   <br>&emsp;There is great folly in teaching our children“what influences stem from Pisces and the lively constellation of Leo or from Capricorn which plunges into the Hesperian Sea, ” about the heavenly bodies and the motions of the Eighth Sphere before they know about their own properties. “What do the Pleiades or the Herdsman matter to me!” Writing to Anaximenes, Pythagoras asked: ‘What mind am I supposed to bring to the secrets of the heavens, having death and slavery ever present before my eyes?’ (At that time the kings of Persia were preparing for war against his country.)- We could all ask the same: ‘Assaulted as I am by ambition, covetousness, rashness and superstition, and having such enemies to life as that within me, should I start wondering about the motions of the Universe?’  
   <br>&emsp;Only after showing the boy what will make him a wiser and a better man will you explain to him the elements of Logic, Physics, Geometry and Rhetoric. Since his judgement has already been formed he will soon get to the bottom of any science he chooses. His lessons will sometimes be discussion, sometimes reading from books; at times the tutor will provide him with extracts from authors suited to his purposes: at others the tutor will pick out the marrow and chew it over for him. If the tutor is not sufficiently familiar with those books to find the discourses in them which serve his purposes you could associate with him a scholar who could furnish him, as the need arises, with material for him to arrange and dispense to the growing boy.  
   <br>&emsp;Who can doubt that such lessons will be more natural and easy than those in Theodore Gaza,- whose precepts are prickly and nasty, and whose words are hollow and fleshless, with nothing to get hold of or to quicken the mind. Here then is nourishment for the soul to bite on. The fruit is incomparably more plentiful and will ripen sooner.  
   <br>&emsp;Oddly, things have now reached such a state that even among men of intelligence philosophy means something fantastical and vain, without value or usefulness, both in opinion and practice. The cause lies in chop-logic which has captured all the approaches. It is a great mistake to portray Philosophy with a haughty, frowning, terrifying face, or as inaccessible to the young. Whoever clapped that wan and frightening mask on her face! There is nothing more lovely, more happy and gay - I almost said more amorously playful. Some philosophers were sitting together in the temple at Delphi one day. ‘Either I am mistaken,’ said Demetrius the grammarian, ‘or your calm happy faces show that you are not having an important discussion.’ One of them, Herakleon of Megara, retorted: ‘Furrowed brows are for grammarians telling us whether ballo takes two Is in the future, researching into the derivation of the comparatives keiron and beltion and of the superlatives keiriston and beltiston: philosophical discussions habitually make men happy and joyful not frowning and sad.’ What she preaches is all feast and fun. A sad and gloomy mien shows you have mistaken her address.  “You can detect in a sickly body the hidden torments of the mind; you can detect her joys as well: the face reflects them both.” 
   <br>&emsp;The soul which houses philosophy must by her own sanity make for a sound body. Her tranquillity and ease must glow from her; she must fashion her outward bearing to her mould, arming it therefore with gracious pride, a spritely active demeanour and a happy welcoming face. The most express sign of wisdom is unruffled joy: like all in the realms above the Moon, her state is ever serene. Baroco and Baralipton have devotees reeking of filth and smoke.- She does not. They know her merely by hearsay. Why, her task is to make the tempests of the soul serene and to teach hunger and fever how to laugh - not by imaginary epicycles but by reasons, natural and palpable.- Her aim is virtue, which is not (as they teach in schools) perched on the summit of a steep mountain, rough and inaccessible. Those who have drawn nigh her hold that on the contrary she dwells on a beautiful plateau, fertile and strewn with flowers; from there she clearly sees all things beneath her; but if you know the road you can happily make your way there by shaded grassy paths, flower-scented, smooth and gently rising, like tracks in the vaults of heaven.  
   <br>&emsp;This highest virtue is fair, triumphant, loving, as delightful as she is courageous, a professed and implacable foe to bitterness, unhappiness, fear and constraint, having Nature for guide, Fortune and Pleasure for her companions: those who frequent her not have, after their own weakness, fashioned an absurd portrait of her, sad, shrill, sullen, threatening and glowering, perching her on a rocky peak, all on her own among the brambles - a spectre to terrify people.  
   <br>&emsp;This tutor of mine, who knows that his duty is to fill the will of his pupil with at least as much love as reverence for virtue, will know how to tell him that our poets are following commonplace humours: he will make him realize that the gods place sweat on the paths to the chambers of Venus rather than of Pallas.- And when he comes to know his own mind and is faced with a choice between Bradamante to court and enjoy or Angelica- - one with her natural beauty, active, noble, virile though not mannish, contrasting with the other’s beauty, soft, dainty, delicate and all artifice; the one disguised as a youth with a shining helmet on her head, the other robed as a maiden with pearls in her headdress: then his very passion will be deemed manly if he chooses flat contrary to that effeminate Phrygian shepherd.- The tutor will then be teaching him a new lesson: what makes true virtue highly valued is the ease, usefulness and pleasure we find in being virtuous: so far from it being difficult, children can be virtuous as well as adults; the simple, as well as the clever. The means virtue uses is control not effort.  
   <br>&emsp;Socrates, the foremost of her darlings, deliberately renounced effort so as to glide along with her easy natural progress. She is a Mother who nurtures human pleasures: by making them just she makes them sure and pure; by making them moderate they never pant for breath or lose their savour; by cutting away those which she denies us she sharpens our appreciation of those she leaves us - an abundance of all those which Nature wills for us; Mother-like, she provides them not until we are satiated but until we are satisfied. If Virtue should lack the ordinary share of good fortune, she evades or does without it, or else she forges a private happiness of her own, neither floating nor changeable. She knows how to be rich, powerful and learned and how to lie on a perfumed couch; she does love life; she does love beauty, renown and health. But her own peculiar office is to know how to enjoy those good things with proper moderation and how to lose them with constancy: an office much more noble than grievous.       
   <br>&emsp;Were our pupil’s disposition so bizarre that he would rather hear a tall story than the account of a great voyage or a wise discussion; that at the sound of the drum calling the youthful ardour of his comrades to arms he would turn aside for the drum of a troop of jugglers; that he would actually find it no more delightful and pleasant to return victorious covered with the dust of battle than after winning a prize for tennis or dancing: then I know no remedy except that his tutor should quickly strangle him when nobody is looking or apprentice him to make fairycakes in some goodly town - even if he were the heir of a Duke. Following Plato’s precept that functions should be allocated not according to the endowments of men’s fathers but the endowments of their souls.  
   <br>&emsp;Since philosophy is the art which teaches us how to live, and since children need to learn it as much as we do at other ages, why do we not instruct them in it? “The clay is soft and malleable. Quick! hurry to fashion it on that potter’s wheel which is for ever spinning. ” They teach us to live when our life is over. Dozens of students have caught the pox before they reach the lesson on temperance in their Aristotles. Cicero said that even were he to live two men’s lives he would never find enough time to study the lyric poets. I find these chop-logic merchants even more gloomily useless. Our boy is too busy for that: to school-learning he owes but the first fifteen or sixteen years of his life: the rest is owed to action. Let us employ a time so short on things which it is necessary to know. Get rid of those thorny problems of dialectics - they are trivial: our lives are never amended by them; take the simple arguments of philosophy: learn how to select the right ones and to apply them. They are easier to grasp than a tale in Boccaccio: a boy can do it as soon as he leaves his nanny; it is much easier than learning to read and write. Philosophy has arguments for Man at birth as well as in senility.  
   <br>&emsp;I share Plutarch’s conviction- that Aristotle never spent much of the time of his great pupil Alexander on the art of syllogisms nor on the principles of geometry: he taught him, rather, sound precepts concerning valour, prowess, greatness of soul and temperance, as well as that self-assurance which fears nothing. With such an armoury he sent him still a child to conquer the empire of the world with merely thirty thousand foot-soldiers, four thousand horsemen and forty-two thousand crowns. As for the other arts and sciences, Plutarch says that he held them in esteem, praising their excellence and their nobility; but whatever pleasure he found in them he did not allow himself to be surprised by a desire to practise them himself.  
   <br>&emsp;“ Seek here, young men and old, a lasting purpose for your mind and a provision for white-haired wretchedness.” That is what Epicurus says at the beginning of his letter to Meniceus: ‘Let the youngest not reject philosophy nor the oldest tire of it. Whoever does otherwise seems to be saying that the season for living happily has not yet come or is already past.’   
   <br><br><br>Despite all this I do not want to imprison the boy. I do not want him to be left to the melancholy humour of a furious schoolmaster. I do not want to corrupt his mind as others do by making his work a torture, slaving away for fourteen or fifteen hours a day like a porter. When you see him over-devoted to studying his books because of a solitary or melancholy complexion, it would not be good I find to encourage him in it: it unfits boys for mixing in polite society and distracts them from better things to do. And how many men have I known in my time made as stupid as beasts by an indiscreet hunger for knowledge! Carneades was turned so mad by it that he could not find time to tend to his hair or his nails.  
   <br>&emsp;Nor do I wish to have his noble manners ruined by the uncouthness or barbarity of others. In antiquity French wisdom was proverbially good at the outset, but lacking in staying power. And truly, still now, nothing is more gentlemanly than little French children; but they normally deceive the hopes placed in them, being in no ways outstanding once they are grown up. I have heard men of wisdom maintain that it is those colleges which parents send children to - and we have them in abundance - which make them so stupid.  
   <br>&emsp;For our boy any place and any time can be used to study: his room, a garden; his table, his bed; when alone or in company; morning and evening. His chief study will be philosophy, that Former of good judgement and character who is privileged to be concerned with everything.  
   <br>&emsp;It was an orator Isocrates who, being begged to talk about his art at a feast, replied (rightly we all think): ‘What I can do, this is no time for: what this is time for, I cannot do! — To present harangues and rhetorical debates to a company gathered for laughter and good cheer would be to mix together things too discordant. You can say the same of all the other disciplines, but not of that part of Philosophy which treats of Man, his tasks and his duties: by the common consent of all the wise, she should not be barred from sports nor feastings seeing that commerce with her is sweet. And Plato having invited her to his Banquet, we can see how she entertained the guests in a relaxed manner appropriate to time and place even when treating one of her most sublime and most salutary themes : “She is equally helpful to the poor and the rich: neglect her, and she equally harms the young and the old.” In this way he will certainly lie fallow much less than do others.  
   <br>&emsp;Now we can take three times as many steps strolling about a long-gallery and still feel less tired than on a walk to a definite goal: so too our lessons will slip by unnoticed if we apparently happen upon them, as, restricted to neither time or place, they intermingle with all our activities. The games and sports themselves will form a good part of his studies: racing, wrestling, music-making, dancing, hunting and the handling of arms and horses. I want his outward graces, his social ease and his physical dexterity to be moulded step by step with his soul. We are not bringing up a soul; we are not bringing up a body: we are bringing up a man. We must not split him into two. We must not bring up one without the other but, as Plato said, lead them abreast like a pair of horses harnessed together to the same shaft. And does not Plato when you listen to him appear to devote more time and care to exercising the body, convinced that the mind may be exercised with the body but not vice versa? This education is to be conducted, moreover, with a severe gentleness, not as it usually is.— Instead of children being invited to letters as guests, all they are shown in truth are cruelty and horror. Get rid of violence and force: as I see it, nothing so fundamentally stultifies and bastardizes a well-born nature. If you want the boy to loathe disgrace and punishment do not harden him to them. Harden him to sweltering heat and to cold, to wind and sun and to such dangers as he must leam to treat with contempt. Rid him of all softness and delicacy about dress and about sleeping, eating and drinking. Get him used to anything. Do not turn him into a pretty boy or a ladies’ boy but into a boy who is fresh and vigorous.  
   <br>&emsp;Boy, man and now old man, I have always thought this. But I have always disliked, among other things, the way our colleges are governed. Their failure would have been less harmful, perhaps, if they had leant towards indulgence. They are a veritable gaol for captive youth. By punishing boys for depravity before they are depraved, you make them so. Go there during lesson time: you will hear nothing but the screaming of tortured children and of masters drunk with rage. What a way to awaken a taste for learning in those tender timorous souls, driving them to it with terrifying scowls and fists armed with canes! An iniquitous and pernicious system. And besides (as Quintilian justly remarked)- such imperious authority can lead to dreadful consequences - especially given our form of flogging. How much more appropriate to strew their classrooms with leaf and flower than with blood-stained birch-rods. I would have portraits of Happiness there and Joy, with Flora and the Graces, as Speucippus the philosopher did in his school. When they have something to gain, make it enjoyable. Health-giving foods should be sweetened for a child: harmful ones made to taste nasty.   
   <br>&emsp;It is amazing how concerned Plato is in his Laws with the amusements and pastimes of the youths of his City and how he dwells on their races, sports, singing, capering and dancing, the control and patronage of which has been entrusted, he said, in antiquity to the gods, to Apollo, the Muses and Minerva. His care extends to over a hundred precepts for his gymnasia, yet he spends little time over book-learning; the only thing he seems specifically to recommend poetry for is the music. In our manners and behaviour any strangeness and oddness are to be avoided as enemies of easy mixing in society - and as monstrosities. Who would not have been deeply disturbed by Alexander’s steward Demophon whose complexion made him sweat in the shade and shiver in the sun? I have known men who fly from the smell of apples rather than from gunfire; others who are terrified of a mouse, who vomit at the sight of cream or when a feather mattress is shaken up (like Germanicus who could not abide cocks or their crowing). Some occult property may be involved in this, but, if you ask me, if you set about it young enough you could stamp it out. One victory my education has achieved over me (though not without some trouble, it is true) is that my appetite can be brought to accept without distinction any of the things people eat and drink except beer. While the body is still supple it should, for that very reason, be made pliant to all manners and customs. Provided that he can restrain his appetites and his will, you should not hesitate to make the young man suited to all peoples and companies, even, should the need arise, to immoderation and excess. His practice should conform to custom.  He should be able to do anything but want to do only what is good. I would want him to outstrip his fellows in vigour and firmness even during the carousing and that he should refrain from wrongdoing not because he lacks strength or knowledge but because he does not want to do it.  
   <div class="qu">There is a great difference between not wanting to do evil and not knowing how to</div>
   I have often noted with great astonishment the extraordinary character of Alcibiades who, without impairing his health, could so readily adapt to diverse manners: at times he could outdo Persians in pomp and luxury; at others, Spartans in austerity and frugal living.- He was a reformed man in Sparta, yet equally pleasure-seeking in Ionia: “On Aristippus any colour, rank or condition was becoming.”  
   <br><br><br>Thus would I fashion my pupil: “One who is patiently clad in rags yet could also adapt to the opposite extreme, playing both roles becomingly: him I will admire admire.”  
   <br>&emsp;Such are my lessons.- For him who draws most profit from them, they are acts, not facts. To see his deeds is to hear his word: to hear his word is to see his deeds. ‘God forbid,’ says someone in Plato, ‘that philosophy should mean learning a lot of things and then talking about the arts: “The fullest art of all - that of living good lives - they acquired more from life than from books.”  
   <br>&emsp;Prince Leon of the Phliasians inquired of Heraclides of Pontus which art or science he professed. ‘I know none of them’, he replied; ‘I am a philosopher.’ Diogenes was reproached for being ignorant yet concerned with philosophy. ‘My concern is all the more appropriate,’ he replied. When Hegesias begged him to read a certain book he replied, ‘How amusing of you. You prefer real figs to painted ones, so why not true and natural deeds to written ones?”  
   <br>&emsp;My pupil will not say his lesson: he will do it. He will rehearse his lessons in his actions. You will then see whether he is wise in what he takes on, good and just in what he does, gracious and sound in what he says, resilient in illnesses, modest in his sports, temperate in his pleasures, indifferent to the taste of his food, be it fish or flesh, wine or water; orderly in domestic matters: “as a man who knows how to make his education into a rule of life not a means of showing off; who can control himself and obey his own principles.”  The true mirror of our discourse is the course of our lives.        
   <br>&emsp;To a man who asked him why the Spartans never drew up written rules of bravery and gave them to their children, Zeuxidamus replied that they wished to accustom them to deeds not words. After fifteen or sixteen years compare with that one of our college latinizers who has spent precisely as long simply learning to talk! The world is nothing but chatter: I have never met a man who does not say more than he should rather than less. Yet half of our life is spent on that; they keep us four or five years learning the meanings of words and stringing them into sentences; four or five more in learning how to arrange them into a long composition, divided into four parts or five; then as many again in plaiting and weaving them into verbal subtleties. Let us leave all that to those who make it their express profession. Tempt the boy to want to study and love it, dining on the fruits of such toils.   
   <div class="qu">Learning must lodge with us: we must marry her</div>

      Good sense is the most evenly distributed thing in the world; for everyone believes himself to be so well provided with it that even those who are the hardest to please in every other way do not usually want more of it than they already have. Nor is it likely that everyone is wrong about this; rather, what this shows is that the power of judging correctly and of distinguishing the true from the false (which is what is properly called good sense or reason) is naturally equal in all men, and that consequently the diversity of our opinions arises not from the fact that some of us are more reasonable than others, but solely that we have different ways of directing our thoughts, and do not take into account the same things. For it is not enough to possess a good mind; the most important thing is to apply it correctly. The greatest minds are capable of the greatest vices as well as the greatest virtues; those who go forward but very slowly can get further, if they always follow the right road, than those who are in too much of a hurry and stray off it.  
      <br>&emsp;For myself, I have never presumed my mind to be any way more accomplished than that of the common man. Indeed, I have often wished that my mind was as fast, my imagination as clear and precise, and my memory as well stocked and sharp as those of certain other people. And I personally know of no any other mental attributes that go to make up an accomplished mind; for, as regards reason or good sense (insofar as it is the only thing that makes us human and distinguishes us from brute beasts), I am ready to believe that it is altogether complete in every one of us, and I am prepared to follow in this the agreed doctrine of those philosophers who say that differences of degree apply only to accidents, and not to forms or natures of individuals of the same species.  
      <br>&emsp;But I venture to claim that since my early youth I have had the great good fortune of finding myself taking certain paths that have led me to reflections and maxims from which I have fashioned a method by which, it seems to me, I have a way of adding progressively to my knowledge and raising it by degrees to the highest point that the limitations of my mind and the short span of life allotted to me will permit it to reach. For I have already reaped so many fruits from this method that I derive the highest satisfaction from the progress that I believe myself already to have made in my pursuit of truth, in spite of the fact that in appraising my own achievements I try always to err on the side of caution rather than that of presumption, and that when I cast a philosopher’s eye over the various actions and undertakings of mankind, there is hardly a single one that does not seem to me to be vain and futile. And I conceive such hopes for the future that if, among the purely human occupations, there is one that is really good and important, I venture to believe that it is the one that I have chosen. 
      <br>&emsp;It is, however, possible that I am wrong, and that I am mistaking bits of copper and glass for gold and diamonds. I know how likely we are to be wrong on our own account, and how suspect is the judgement of our friends when it is in our favour. Nonetheless, in this essay I shall gladly reveal the paths I have followed and paint my life as it were in a picture, so that everyone may come to a judgement about it; and from hearing the reactions of the public to this picture, I shall add a new way of acquiring knowledge to those which I habitually employ.  
      <br>&emsp;So my aim here is not to teach the method that everyone must follow for the right conduct of his reason, but only to show in what way I have tried to conduct mine. Those who take it upon themselves to give direction to others must believe themselves more capable than those to whom they give it, and bear the responsibility for the slightest error they might make. But as I am putting this essay forward only as a historical record, or if you prefer, a fable, in which among a number of examples worthy of imitation one may also find several which one would be right not to follow, I hope that it may prove useful to some people without being harmful to any, and that my candour will be appreciated by everyone.  
      <br>&emsp;I was educated in classical studies from my earliest years, and because I was given to believe that through them one could acquire clear and sure knowledge of everything that one needed in life, I was extremely eager to acquire them. But as soon as I had finished my course of study, at which time it is usual to be admitted to the ranks of the well educated, I completely changed my opinion, for I found myself bogged down in so many doubts and errors, that it seemed to me that having set out to become learned, I had derived no benefit from my studies, other than that of progressively revealing to myself how ignorant I was. And yet I was a pupil of one of the most famous schools in Europe, in which I believed that there must be as learned men as are to be found anywhere on earth. There I had learnt everything that others were learning; and not just content with the subjects that we were taught, I had even read all the books that fell into my hands on subjects that are considered the most occult and recondite. Moreover, I knew what assessment others had made of me, and realized that I was not thought inferior to my fellow pupils, even though several among them had already been singled out to take the place of our teachers. And finally, our age seemed to me to be as flourishing as any preceding age, and to abound in as many great minds. This emboldened me to judge all others by myself, and to think that there was no body of knowledge on earth that lived up to the expectations I had been given of it.  
      <br>&emsp;I did not, however, cease to hold the school curriculum in esteem. I know that the Greek and Latin that are taught there are necessary for understanding the writings of the ancients; that fables stimulate the mind through their charm; that the memorable deeds recorded in histories uplift it, and they help form our judgement when read in a discerning way; that reading good books is like engaging in conversation with the most cultivated minds of past centuries who had composed them, or rather, taking part in a well-conducted dialogue in which such minds reveal to us only the best of their thoughts; that oratory is incomparably powerful and beautiful, and that poetry possesses delightful delicacy and charm; that mathematics has very subtle techniques that can be of great use in satisfying curious minds, as well as in coming to the aid of all the arts, and reducing human labour; that books on morals contain highly instructive teachings and exhortations to virtue; that theology charts our path to heaven; that philosophy provides us with the means of speaking plausibly about anything and impressing those who are less well instructed; that law, medicine, and other disciplines bring to those who profess them riches and honours; and finally, that it is worthwhile to have studied all of these branches of knowledge, even the most superstitious and false, in order to learn their true value and avoid being deceived by them.  
      <br>&emsp;But I then decided that I had devoted enough time both to the study of languages and to the reading of the books, histories, and fables of the classical world. For conversing with those of another age is more or less the same thing as travelling. It is good to know something of the customs of different peoples in order to be able to judge our own more securely, and to prevent ourselves from thinking that everything not in accordance with our own customs is ridiculous and irrational, as those who have see nothing of the world are in the habit of doing. On the other hand, when we spend too much time travelling, we end up becoming strangers in our own country; and when we immerse ourselves too deeply in the practices of bygone ages, we usually remain woefully ignorant of the practices of our own time. Moreover, fables make us conceive of events as being possible where they are not; and even if the most faithful of accounts of the past neither alter nor exaggerate the importance of things in order to make them more attractive to the reader, they nearly always leave out the humblest and least illustrious historical circumstances, with the result that what remains does not appear as it really was, and that those who base their behaviour on the examples they draw from such accounts are likely to try to match the feats of knights of old in tales of chivalry and set themselves targets beyond their powers.  
      <br>&emsp;I held oratory in high esteem, and loved poetry, but I looked upon both as gifts of the mind rather than fruits of study. Those who reason most powerfully and are the most successful at ordering their thoughts so as to make them clear and intelligible will always be best able to persuade others of what they say, even if they speak in the thickest of dialects and have never learned any rhetoric. And those whose linguistic expression is the most pleasing and who frame their thoughts in the most eloquent and agreeable way would always end up being the best poets, even if they did not know a single rule of poetic composition.  
      <br>&emsp;I was most keen on mathematics, because of its certainty and the incontrovertibility of its proofs; but I did not yet see its true use. Believing as I did that its only application was to the mechanical arts, I was astonished that nothing more exalted had been built on such sure and solid foundations; whereas, on the other hand, I compared the moral works of ancient pagan writers to splendid and magnificent palaces built on nothing more than sand and mud. They exalt the virtues, and make them seem more worthy of esteem than anything else on earth; but they do not give sufficient indication of how to learn about them; and what they call by such a fine name is in many cases no more than lack of human feeling, pride, despair, or parricide.  
      <br>&emsp;I revered our theology and hoped as much as anyone to reach heaven; but having learnt as an established fact that the path to heaven is as open to the most ignorant as to the most learned, and that the revealed truths that lead there are beyond our understanding, I would not have dared submit them to my own puny reasoning powers, and believed that in order to engage in the task of studying them, it was indispensable to have some extraordinary assistance from heaven, and to be more than merely human. 
      <br>&emsp;I shall not say anything about philosophy except that, when I realized that it had been cultivated by the best minds for many centuries, and that nevertheless there is nothing in it that is not disputed and consequently is not subject to doubt, I was not so presumptuous as to hope to succeed better than others; and that seeing how different learned men may defend different opinions on the same subject, without there ever being more than one which is true, I deemed anything that was no more than plausible to be tantamount to false.  
      <br>&emsp;As for the other disciplines, in so far as they borrow their principles from philosophy, I concluded that nothing solid could have been built on such shaky foundations. Nor was the honour and the profit they held in prospect enough to persuade me to study them; for I considered myself, through the favour of providence, as not being in the position of having to earn my living from a learned profession for the betterment of my fortune; and although I did not go about sneering at worldly glory as is the habit of Cynics, I nonetheless held that sort of glory, to which I could never hope to have a true claim, in low esteem. Finally, as for the low sciences, I felt that I already knew well enough what they were worth to avoid falling for any of the promises of an alchemist, the predictions of an astrologer, the impostures of a magician, or the tricks and boasts of those who profess to know more than they do.  
      <br>&emsp;That is why, as soon as I reached an age that allowed me to escape from the control of my teachers, I abandoned altogether the study of letters. And having decided to pursue only that knowledge which I might find in myself or in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth travelling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of different character and rank, accumulating different experiences, putting myself to the test in situations in which I found myself by chance, and at all times giving due reflection to things as they presented themselves to me so as to derive some benefit from them. For it seemed to me that I could discover much more truth from the reasoning that we all make about things that affect us and that will soon cause us harm if we misjudge them, than from the speculations in which a scholar engages in the privacy of his study, that have no consequence for him except insofar as the further they are from common sense, the more he will be proud of them, because he has had to use so much more ingenuity and subtlety in the struggle to make them plausible. And I constantly felt a burning desire to learn to distinguish the true from the false, to see my actions for what they were, and to proceed with confidence through life.  
      <br>&emsp;It is true that while I was thinking about the customs of other men and nothing else, I found little to provide me with certain knowledge; I observed in them as much diversity as I had found earlier among the opinions of the philosophers. And so the greatest benefit I derived from these observations was that when I was confronted by things which, although they seem to us very extravagant and ridiculous, are nevertheless widely accepted and approved of by other great nations, I learned not to believe too firmly in anything that only example and custom had persuaded me of. So it was that I freed myself gradually from many of the errors that can obscure the natural light of our minds, and make them less able to see reason. But after having spent several years studying the book of the world and trying to acquire some experience of life, I took the decision one day to look into myself and to use all my mental powers to choose the paths I should follow. In this it seems to me that I have had much more success than if I had never left either my country or my books.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="PARTTWO">
      At that time I was in Germany, where I had been called by the wars that have not yet come to an end there; as I was returning to the army from the coronation of the emperor, I was halted by the onset of winter in quarters where, having no diverting company and fortunately also no cares or emotional turmoil to trouble me, I spent the whole day shut up in a small room heated by a stove, in which I could converse with my own thoughts at leisure. Among the first of these was the realization that things made up of different elements and produced by the hands of several master craftsmen are often less perfect than those on which only one person has worked. This is the case with buildings which a single architect has planned and completed, that are usually more beautiful and better designed than those that several architects have tried to patch together, using old walls that had been constructed for other purposes. This is also the case with those ancient cities, that in the beginning were no more than villages and have become, through the passage of time, great conurbations; when compared to orderly towns that an engineer designs without constraints on an empty plain, they are usually so badly laid out that, even though their buildings viewed separately often display as much if not more artistic merit as those of orderly towns, yet if one takes into consideration the way they are disposed, a tall one here, a low one there, and the way they cause the streets to wind and change level, they look more like the product of chance than of the will of men applying their reason. And if one considers further that there have always been officials whose task it was to ensure that the design of private buildings should contribute to the beauty of the town as a whole, it will become clear how difficult it is to carry anything through to completion when working only with what others have produced. This led me to the view that those nations who were once half-savage and only gradually became more civilized, and whose legislation was forced on them by acts of criminal mischief and legal disagreements, could not be as well governed as those which, from the first moment of their coming together as a nation, observed the constitution laid down by a prudent lawgiver; in the same way, it cannot be doubted that a state which has embraced the true religion whose laws God alone has made must be incomparably better governed than any other. To return to human affairs, I believe that if Sparta once flourished greatly, it was not because of the particular excellence of each one of its laws (seeing that many were very strange and even contrary to good morals), but because having all been laid down by one man, they were all directed to a single end. And so I came to believe that book-learning, or at least learning whose rational foundations are no better than generally approved, and which contains no real proof, is not as close to the truth, composed as it is of the opinions of many different people, as the simple reasoning that any man of good sense can produce about things in his purview. And so, although I came to believe that, because we were children before we were men, and because for a long time we were governed by our appetites and our teachers (the former being often in conflict with the latter, with neither giving the best advice in every case), it is almost impossible that our judgements are as pure or as solid as they might have been if we had had full use of our reason from the moment of our birth, and had been guided by that alone.  
      <br>&emsp;Admittedly, we do not see people pulling down all the houses of a town for the sole purpose of reconstructing them differently in order to embellish the streets; but we do see many people having their own houses demolished in order to rebuild them, and may note that they are even sometimes forced to do so when the buildings are in danger of falling down of themselves or their foundations are insecure. This example convinced me that it would not be reasonable for an individual to set out to reform a state by changing everything from the foundations up, and overthrowing it in order to rebuild it, or even to set out to reform the body of knowledge or the established order in schools for teaching it; but rather, as far as all the opinions I had hitherto accepted were concerned, I could do no better than to set about ridding myself of them once and for all, with a view to replacing them afterwards either with better ones, or even the same ones, once I had tested them with my reason and ensured that they were set straight. I firmly believed that by these means I would manage to order my life better than if I built on old foundations and relied only upon old principles which had been inculcated in me when young, without my ever having sought to find out whether they were true. For although I could see a number of difficulties in all this, they were not unsurmountable; nor did they compare with those which are found in the smallest reform affecting the body public. Such a great body is too hard to rebuild if once destroyed, or even to keep standing if once shaken, and its fall cannot be anything other than very heavy. Moreover, as for any imperfections such bodies may have (and their very diversity is sufficient to ensure that some at least will have imperfections), custom may have considerably attenuated them, and even managed to circumvent or imperceptibly to correct many that could not have been so well remedied through the exercise of political judgement. Finally, these imperfections are nearly all more bearable than change, in the same way that highways that wind their way between mountains become in the end so smooth and easy through use that it is much better to follow them than to attempt to seek a straighter path, by climbing over rocky promontories and plunging down into deep valleys.  
      <br>&emsp;That is why I could not possibly approve of those meddle-some and restless spirits who are called neither by birth nor by riches to take part in public affairs, yet are forever plotting some reform. And if I thought that there was anything what-soever in this essay that could lead me to be suspected of the same folly, I should be very loath to allow it to be published. My project has never extended beyond wishing to reform my own thoughts and build on a foundation which is mine alone. And if my work has pleased me enough for me to reveal to you here what it is based on, I do not want for all that to suggest that anyone should copy it. Those on whom God has bestowed His grace in greater measure will perhaps have more lofty designs; but I very much fear that mine may already be too bold for many. Even the decision to rid oneself of all the opinions one has hitherto accepted is not an example which everyone ought to follow. The world is made up almost entirely of two sorts of minds to which such a course of action is wholly unsuitable. First, there are those who, believing themselves cleverer than they are, cannot stop themselves jumping to conclusions, and do not have enough patience to govern their thoughts in an orderly way, with the result that once they have allowed themselves to doubt accepted principles and stray from the common path, they would never be able to keep to the road that one must take to proceed in the right direction, and would remain lost all their lives. Second, there are those who, having enough sense or modesty to realize that they are less capable of distinguishing the true from the false than certain others by whom they could be guided, must content themselves with following the opinions of these others rather than seeking better ones from themselves.  
      <br>&emsp;As for myself, I would perhaps have been in this second category if I had only had one teacher, or if I had not known about the differences of opinion that have always existed among the most learned. But having already discovered at school that there is no opinion so bizarre and incredible that has not been uttered by some philosopher or other, and having come later in the course of my travels to the realization that all those who have opinions that are diametrically opposed to ours are not on that account barbarians or savages, but that among their number there are many who make use of their reason as much or more than we do; and having considered how a given man with a given mind, brought up since childhood among the French or the Germans, develops differently from the way he would if he had always lived among the Chinese or among cannibals, and how even down to our fashion of dress, the very thing that pleased us ten years ago and may perhaps please us in ten years’ time at present seems outlandish and ridiculous to our eyes (this is because we are much more swayed by custom and example than any certain knowledge; and yet the majority view is of no value as proof of truths which are difficult to discover, because they are much more likely to be discovered by one man by himself than by a whole people); for all these reasons, I could not choose any one person whose opinions struck me as preferable to those of others, and I found myself forced, as it were, to provide for myself my own guidance.  
      <br>&emsp;But like a man walking by himself in the dark, I took the decision to go so slowly and to exercise such caution in everything that even if I made very little progress, I would at least be sure not to fall. I did not even wish to begin by rejecting absolutely all the opinions that might have slipped into my mind without having been introduced there by reason, until I had first spent enough time planning the work I was undertaking and searching for the true method of arriving at the knowledge of everything that my mind was capable of grasping.  
      <br>&emsp;In earlier years I had made some study of logic in the philosophy course, and of geometrical analysis and algebra in mathematics, three arts or branches of knowledge that seemed destined to contribute to my plan. But, on examining them, I noted, in the case of logic, that its syllogisms and most of its other techniques are employed more to explain things to other people that one knows already or even, as in the art of Lull, to speak injudiciously about those of which one is ignorant, than to learn anything new. And although logic really does contain many very true and excellent precepts, there are so many others mixed in with them that are either harmful or superfluous, that it is almost as difficult to separate the former from the latter as it is to extract a statue of Diana or Minerva from a rough block of marble. As for ancient geometrical analysis and modern algebra, even apart from the fact that they deal only in highly abstract matters that seem to have no practical application, the former is so closely tied to the consideration of figures that it is unable to exercise the intellect without greatly tiring the imagination, while in the latter case one is so much a slave to certain rules and symbols that it has been turned into a confused and obscure art that bewilders the mind instead of being a form of knowledge that cultivates it. This was why I thought that another method had to be found which retained the advantages of all three but was free from their defects. And just as a great number of laws is often a pretext for wrong-doing, with the result that a state is much better governed when, having only a few, they are strictly observed; so also I came to believe that in the place of the great number of precepts that go to make up logic, the following four would be sufficient for my purposes, provided that I took a firm and unshakeable decision never once to depart from them.  
      <br>&emsp;The first was never to accept anything as true that I did not incontrovertibly know to be so; that is to say, carefully to avoid both prejudice and premature conclusions; and to include nothing in my judgements other than that which presented itself to my mind so clearly and distinctly, that I would have no occasion to doubt it.  
      <br>&emsp;The second was to divide all the difficulties under examination into as many parts as possible, and as many as were required to solve them in the best way.  
      <br>&emsp;The third was to conduct my thoughts in a given order, beginning with the simplest and most easily understood objects, and gradually ascending, as it were step by step, to the knowledge of the most complex; and positing an order even on those which do not have a natural order of precedence.  
      <br>&emsp;The last was to undertake such complete enumerations and such general surveys that I would be sure to have left nothing out.  
      <br>&emsp;The long chains of reasonings, every one simple and easy, which geometers habitually employ to reach their most difficult proofs had given me cause to suppose that all those things which fall within the domain of human understanding follow on from each other in the same way, and that as long as one stops oneself taking anything to be true that is not true and sticks to the right order so as to deduce one thing from another, there can be nothing so remote that one cannot eventually reach it, nor so hidden that one cannot discover it. And I had little difficulty in determining those with which it was necessary to begin, for I already knew that I had to begin with the simplest and the easiest to understand; and considering that of all those who had up to now sought truth in the sphere of human knowledge, only mathematicians have been able to discover any proofs, that is, any certain and incontrovertible arguments, I did not doubt that I should begin as they had done. Nor did I expect any other usefulness from this, than to accustom my mind to nourish itself on truths and reject false reasonings. Yet I did not, for all that, intend to study all those particular branches of knowledge which habitually go under the name of mathematics; I saw that, although their objects were different, they nevertheless all concurred insofar as they only took into consideration the different relations or proportions to be found among these objects, and I came to think that it was best for me to examine only these proportions in general, without supposing their existence except in those areas of enquiry which would serve to make my knowledge of them easier; and moreover, not to restrict them to those areas, in order to be better able to apply them thereafter to everything else to which they might be applied. Then, having noted that, in order to know them, I would sometimes need to think about them separately, and sometimes only bear them in mind, or consider many together, I came to the view that, in order to consider these proportions best separately, I had to suppose them to hold between lines, because I found nothing simpler nor more capable of being distinctly represented to my imagination and to my senses. But for the purpose of retaining them in my memory, or grasping several together, it was necessary for me to designate them by the briefest possible symbols; by this means I would borrow what was best from geometrical analysis and algebra, and would correct all the defects of the one by the other.  
      <br>&emsp;And indeed, I venture to claim that the scrupulous observance of the few precepts I had chosen gave me such ease in unravelling all the questions covered by these two branches of knowledge that in the two or three months I spent investigating them, having begun with the simplest and most general (every truth that I discovered being a rule that I used afterwards to find others), not only did I solve some which I had earlier judged very difficult, but it also seemed to me, towards the end of this period, that I was able to determine, even in respect of those questions which I had not solved, by what means and to what extent it was possible to solve them. In claiming this I will appear perhaps less conceited to you if you consider that, as there is only one truth of any one thing, whoever finds it knows as much as can be known about it, and that, for example, a child trained in arithmetic who does a sum according to the rules can be quite certain of having discovered everything the human mind can find out about the sum in question. In short, the method that teaches one to follow the correct order and to enumerate all the factors of the object under examination, contains everything that confers certainty on arithmetical rules.  
      <br>&emsp;But what pleased me most about this method was that, through it, I was certain in all cases to employ my reason, if not perfectly, then at least to the best of my ability; moreover, I believed that, in practising it, my mind was gradually getting used to conceiving of its objects more clearly and distinctly, and that not having set it to work on any particular matter, I was able to set myself the task of applying it just as usefully to the problems of other branches of knowledge as I had done to those of algebra. Not that I ventured, for all that, to examine all the problems I might come across; for that would have been contrary to the order prescribed by my method. But having noted that the principles of each branch of knowledge must of necessity all be borrowed from philosophy, in which I could still find no certain principles, I came to think that it was first necessary for me to try to establish some; and that this being the most important thing in the world and one in which undue haste and preconceptions were most to be feared, I thought that I ought not to attempt to carry this task through to completion until I had reached a much more mature age than the twenty-three years I then was, and until I had spent considerable time in preparing myself for the task, as much by rooting out of my mind all the false opinions I had accepted up to then, as by amassing a large number of experiences to serve afterwards as the matter of my reasoning, and by continually practising my chosen method in order to strengthen my grasp of it.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="PARTTHREE">
      Finally, just as it is not enough, before beginning to rebuild the house in which one lives, to do no more than demolish it, make provision for materials and architects, or become oneself trained as an architect, or even to have carefully drawn up the plans, but one must also provide oneself with another house in which one may be comfortably lodged while work is in progress; so also, in order not to remain indecisive in my actions while my reason was forcing me to be so in my judgements, and to carry on living from then on as happily as I could, I formed a provisional moral code for myself consisting in only three or four maxims, which I should like to share with you.  
      <br>&emsp;The first was to obey the laws and customs of my country, and to adhere to the religion in which God by His grace had me instructed from my childhood, and to govern myself in everything else according to the most moderate and least extreme opinions, being those commonly received among the wisest of those with whom I should have to live. For, having begun already to discount my own opinions because I wished to subject them all to rigorous examination, I was certain that I could do no better than to follow those of the wisest. And although there may be as many wise people among the Persians and the Chinese as among ourselves, it seemed to me that the most useful thing to do would be to regulate my conduct by that of the people among whom I was to live; and that for me to know what their opinions really were, I had to take note of what they did rather than what they said, not only because in the present corrupt state of our morals few people are willing to declare everything they believe, but also because some do not even know what they believe; for the mental act by which we believe something, being different from that act by which we know that we believe it, often results in one act being present without the other. And I chose only the most moderate among many opinions which were equally widely received, as much because these are always easiest to practise and likely to be the best (excesses all being usually bad) as to wander less far from the true path in case I should be wrong, and that having followed one extreme, it transpired that I should have followed the other. And in particular, I placed in the category of these excesses all personal commitments by which one relinquishes some of one’s freedom. Not that I disapprove of the laws that, in order to counteract the inconsistency of those who are weak-minded, permit men to make verbal undertakings or contracts which bind them not to break them (in cases where they have some worthy plan, or even, to guarantee the security of commerce, some plan which is no more than morally indifferent); but, because I saw nothing in this world which remained always in the same state, and because in my own case I set myself the task of gradually perfecting my judgements and not of making them worse, I would have seen myself as sinning against good sense if, having once approved of something, I should have found myself obliged to take it to be good later on, when it might have ceased to be so, or I might have ceased to consider it so.  
      <br>&emsp;My second maxim was to be as firm and resolute in my actions as I could, and to follow no less constantly the most doubtful opinions, once I had opted for them, than I would have if they had been the most certain ones. In this I imitated those travellers who, finding themselves lost in a forest, must not wander in circles first to one side then to the other, and still less stop in one place, but have to walk as straight as possible in one direction, and not alter course for weak reasons, even if it might only have been chance which had led them to settle on the direction they had chosen; for by this means, even if they do not end up precisely where they want to be, they will eventually reach somewhere where they will most likely be better off than the middle of a forest. And, in the same way, as in life we must often act without delay, it is a very certain truth that when it is not in our power to determine which the truest opinions are, we should follow those which are most likely to be true, and even though we might see no more probability in some rather than others, we must nevertheless opt for one set, and thereafter consider them not as being doubtful, insofar as they relate to the practice of life, but as altogether true and certain, because the reasoning that led us to opt for them is true and certain. This maxim was able from then on to free me from all the regret and remorse that usually troubles the consciences of weak and vacillating minds, who are inconsistent and allow themselves to follow certain practices as though they were good, that they later judge to be bad.  
      <br>&emsp;My third maxim was to endeavour always to master myself rather than fortune, to try to change my desires rather than to change the order of the world, and in general to settle for the belief that there is nothing entirely in our power except our thoughts, and after we have tried, in respect of things external to us, to do our best, everything in which we do not succeed is absolutely impossible as far as we are concerned. This alone seemed to me to be sufficient to prevent me from desiring anything in future which I could not obtain, and thereby to make me content. For as our will is naturally inclined to desire only those things which our intellect represents to it as possible in some way, it is certain that if we consider all external goods as being equally beyond our power, we shall not feel any more regret at failing to obtain those which seem to be our birthright when deprived of them through no fault of our own, than we shall for not possessing the kingdoms of China and Mexico; and by making a virtue out of necessity, as the saying goes, we shall no more desire to be healthy when we are ill or free when we are in prison, than we do now to have bodies made of matter as incorruptible as diamonds or wings to allow us to fly like birds. But I admit that it takes long practice and reiterated periods of meditation to make oneself used to seeing things from this angle; and I believe that it is principally in this that lay the secret of those philosophers who were able in earlier times to escape the tyranny of fortune and, in spite of suffering and poverty, to rival their gods in happiness. For through constant reflection on the limits laid upon them by nature, they convinced themselves so completely that nothing was in their power other than their thoughts, that this conviction alone was sufficient to prevent them from having any desire for anything else; and they controlled their thoughts so effectively that they thereby believed themselves with some reason to be richer, more powerful, freer, and happier than any other men who, not having this philosophy, never have this control over their desires, however favoured by nature and fortune they may be.  
      <br>&emsp;Finally, as a conclusion to this moral code, I decided to review the various occupations that men have in this life, in order to try to select the best one. Without wishing to pass judgement on the occupations of others, I came to the view that I could do no better than to continue in the one in which I found myself, that is to say, to devote my life to the cultivation of my reason and make such progress as I could in the knowledge of the truth following the method I had prescribed for myself. I had experienced such great joy since I began to employ this method that I did not believe that any sweeter or more innocent pleasures were to be had in this life; and as I discovered daily by its means a number of truths that seemed to me very important and generally unknown to other men, the satisfaction that I obtained from it filled my mind to such a degree that nothing else mattered to me. Besides, the three foregoing maxims were based only on the plan I had to continue to seek knowledge; for since God has given each of us an inner light to distinguish the true from the false, I would not have believed for one moment that I should content myself with the opinions of others, if I had not intended in due course to use my own judgement to examine them; and I could not have avoided having scruples about following them, if I had not hoped thereby to seize every opportunity to find better ones, in case there were any. Finally, I should not have known how to limit my desires or achieve happiness, if I had not followed a path by which I thought I was sure to acquire all the knowledge of which I was capable, and, by the same means, all the true goods that it would ever be in my power to obtain; and seeing that our will tends to pursue or shun only what our intellect represents to it as good or bad, it is sufficient to make a sound judgement in order to act well, and to judge as well as we can in order to do our best; that is to say, to acquire all the virtues and with them all the other goods we are capable of acquiring. And when we are certain that this state of affairs exists, we cannot fail to be happy.  
      <br>&emsp;Once I had established these maxims, and set them aside in my mind with the truths of the faith which have always held first place in my beliefs, I took the decision that, as far as the rest of my opinions were concerned, I could freely undertake to rid myself of them. And seeing that I expected to be better able to complete this task in the company of others than by remaining shut any longer in the stove-heated room in which I had had all these thoughts, I set out on my travels again before winter was over. And through all the next nine years I did nothing but wander through the world, trying to be a spectator rather than an actor in all the dramas that are played out on that stage; and, reflecting particularly in each matter on what might make it suspect and give occasion for error, I proceeded to eradicate from my mind all the mistakes that might earlier have crept into it. In doing this, I was not copying those sceptics who doubt for doubting’s sake, and pretend to be always unable to reach a decision; for, on the contrary, the aim of my whole plan was to reach certainty and reject shifting ground in the search for rock and clay. And in this, it seems to me, I succeeded reasonably well, seeing that, in trying to expose the falsity or uncertainty of the propositions that I was investigating not by weak conjectures but by clear and certain reasoning, I found none so doubtful that I could not draw some reasonably certain conclusion from it, even if the conclusion was no more than that the proposition in question contained nothing of certainty. And just as, in demolishing an old building, one usually preserves the debris in order to use it in constructing a new one; so also, in destroying all those of my opinions which I judged to be ill-founded, I made various observations and accumulated many experiences which have been of use to me subsequently in establishing more certain opinions. What is more, I continued to practise the method I had prescribed for myself, for, besides taking care generally to conduct all my thoughts according to these rules, I occasionally set aside a few hours which I spent applying it to difficulties in mathematics, or even to others which I could more or less translate into mathematical terms by removing from them all the principles of the other branches of knowledge which I did not find solid enough; you will see I have done this to many problems that are dealt with in this volume. And so, while apparently living in the same way as those who, having no occupation other than leading a blameless and agreeable life, take care to keep their pleasures free from vices and who, in order to enjoy their leisure without becoming bored, engage in all those pastimes that are honourable, I never stopped pursuing my plan and making progress in the knowledge of truth, perhaps more than if I had done nothing else than read books and spend time in the company of men of letters.  
      <br>&emsp;However, those nine years passed by before I had reached any decision about the questions that are often debated among the learned, or had begun to look for the foundations of any philosophy which might be more certain than that which is commonly received. And the example of the many excellent minds who, having embarked on this project before me, did not appear to have succeeded, led me to see it as so difficult that I would perhaps not have dared to undertake the task so early if I had not learned that some people were already spreading the rumour that I had completed it. I cannot say on what they based this opinion. If I have done anything to contribute to it by what I have said in public, it must have been by owning up to what I did not know with greater freedom than is usual among those who have undertaken some study, and perhaps also by revealing the reasons that I had to doubt much that others take to be certain, rather than by boasting of any positive knowledge. But having enough self-esteem not to wish to be taken for other than I was, I came to think that it was necessary for me to try by every possible means to make myself worthy of the reputation I was being given. And it is now just eight years since this desire made me decide to move away from all the places where I might have acquaintances and to retire here, in a country in which the long period of war has established such good discipline that the armies that are maintained here seem only to serve to ensure that people enjoy the fruits of peace with correspondingly greater security, and where amid a teeming, active, great people that shows more interest in its own affairs than curiosity for those of others, I have been able to live as solitary and as retiring a life as I would in the most remote of deserts, while lacking none of the comforts found in the most populous cities.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="PARTFOUR">
      I do not know whether I am bound to tell you about the first meditations that I engaged in there, for they are so metaphysical and recondite that they may not be to everyone’s taste. And yet, to make it possible to judge whether the foundations I have laid are firm enough, I find myself in a way forced to speak about them. As has already been said, I had long since observed that, as far as morals are concerned, it is necessary sometimes to follow opinions which one knows to be very unsure as if they were indubitable; but because I wished at that time to concentrate on the pursuit of truth, I came to think that I should do the exact opposite and reject as completely false everything in which I could detect the least doubt, in order to see if anything thereafter remained in my belief that was completely indubitable. And so, because our senses sometimes deceive us, I decided to suppose that nothing was such as they lead us to imagine it to be. And because there are men who make mistakes in reasoning, even about the simplest elements of geometry, and commit logical fallacies, I judged that I was as prone to error as anyone else, and I rejected as false all the reasoning I had hitherto accepted as valid proof. Finally, considering that all the same thoughts which we have while awake can come to us while asleep without any one of them then being true, I resolved to pretend that everything that had ever entered my head was no more true than the illusions of my dreams. But immediately afterwards I noted that, while I was trying to think of all things being false in this way, it was necessarily the case that I, who was thinking them, had to be something; and observing this truth: I am thinking therefore I exist, was so secure and certain that it could not be shaken by any of the most extravagant suppositions of the sceptics, I judged that I could accept it without scruple, as the first principle of the philosophy I was seeking.  
      <br>&emsp;Next, examining attentively what I was, I saw that I could pretend that I had no body and that there was no world or place for me to be in, but that I could not for all that pretend that I did not exist; on the contrary, from the very fact that I thought of doubting the truth of other things, it followed incontrovertibly and certainly that I myself existed, whereas, if I had merely ceased thinking, I would have no reason to believe that I existed, even if everything else I had ever imagined had been true. I thereby concluded that I was a substance whose whole essence or nature resides only in thinking, and which, in order to exist, has no need of place and is not dependent on any material thing. Accordingly this ‘I’, that is to say, the Soul by which I am what I am, is entirely distinct from the body and is even easier to know than the body; and would not stop being everything it is, even if the body were not to exist.  
      <br>&emsp;After this, I came to think in general about what is required for a proposition to be true and certain; for since I had just found one such proposition, I thought that I ought also to know in what this certainty consists. And having observed that there was nothing in this proposition, I am thinking therefore I exist, which makes me sure that I am telling the truth, except that I can see very clearly that, in order to think, one has to exist, I concluded that I could take it to be a general rule that things we conceive of very clearly and distinctly are all true, but that there is some difficulty in being able to identify those which we conceive of distinctly.  
      <br>&emsp;As a result of which, as I thought about the fact that I was doubting and that consequently my being was not altogether perfect (for I saw clearly that it was a greater perfection to know than to doubt), I decided to look for the source from which I had learned to think of something more perfect than I was myself, and I came to the incontrovertible realization that this must be from some nature that was in fact more perfect. As for the thoughts I had about many other things outside myself, such as the heavens, the earth, light, heat, and numerous others, I had no such difficulty in knowing where they came from, because, seeing nothing in them which seemed to make them superior to myself, I could believe that if they were true, they depended on my nature in so far as it contained some perfection; and if they were not true, I held them from nothing, that is to say, that they were in me because I was lacking something. But this could not be true of the idea of a being more perfect than mine; for it was manifestly impossible that I should hold this from nothing; and because it is no less contradictory that the more perfect should proceed from and depend on the less perfect than it is that something should proceed from nothing, I could not hold it from myself either. So that there remained only the possibility that it had been put into me by a nature which was truly more perfect than mine, and one which even had in itself all the perfections of which I could have any idea, that is to say, in a word, which was God. To which thought I added that, because I knew some perfections that I did not myself have, I was not the only being who existed (I shall here freely employ, with your permission, some scholastic terminology), but that of necessity there must be some other, more perfect being upon whom I depended and from whom I had acquired all that I possessed. For if I had been the sole being and had been independent of every other being so as to have, of myself, that small degree of participation in the perfection which I shared with the perfect being, I could have been able to have of myself, by the same reason, all the remaining perfection that I knew myself to lack, and so be myself infinite, eternal, unchanging, omniscient, in a word, to have all the perfections which I could observe in God. For, by following this line of reasoning, for me to know the nature of God in so far as my own nature permitted it, I only had to consider, in respect of each thing of which I found in myself some idea, whether it was a perfection to possess it; and I was certain that none of those things which manifested any imperfection was in Him, but that all the others were. In this way I could see that doubt, inconstancy, sadness, and such things could not be in Him, given that I would have been myself very glad to be free of them. Besides this, I had ideas of many corporeal things in the realm of the sensory; for even if I were to suppose that I was dreaming and that everything that I saw or imagined was false, I nevertheless could not deny that the ideas were really in my thought; but because I had already recognized in my own case that the nature of the intellect is distinct from the nature of the body, and considering that all composition is evidence of dependence, and that dependence is manifestly a defect, I concluded that it could not be one of God’s perfections to be composed of these two natures, and that, as a consequence, He was not so composed; but that, if there were in the world any bodies or other intelligences or other natures which were not wholly perfect, their being must depend on His power, in such a way that they could not continue to subsist for a single moment without Him.  
      <br>&emsp;I decided after that to look for other truths; I called to mind the object of study of geometers, which I conceived of as a continuous body or a space indefinitely extended in length, breadth, and height or depth, divisible into different parts which could have various figures and sizes, and be moved or transposed in all sorts of ways, for geometers posit all that to be their object of study. I ran through some of their simpler proofs, and observed that the great certainty which everyone attributes to them is based only on the fact that they are conceived of as incontrovertible, following the rule that I have just given. I noted also that there was absolutely nothing in them which made me certain of the existence of their object. Thus, for example, I grasped clearly that, supposing a triangle to be given, it was necessary that its three angles were equal to two right angles; yet for all that, I saw nothing in this which made me certain that a single triangle existed in the world. Whereas, going back to the idea I had had of a perfect being, I found that existence was part of that idea, in the same way, or even more incontrovertibly so, that it is intrinsic to the idea of a triangle that its three angles equal two right angles, or to that of a sphere that all its parts are equidistant from its centre; and that, in consequence, it is at least as certain as any geometric proof that God, who is that perfect being, is or exists.  
      <br>&emsp;But what convinces many people that there is a problem in knowing Him and even of knowing what their soul is, is that they never raise their mind above the realm of sensory things and are so used not to think of anything except by imagining it, which is a mode of thinking peculiar to material objects, that everything which seems unimaginable seems to them unintelligible. This is clear enough from the fact that even scholastic philosophers hold as a maxim that there is nothing in the intellect which has not previously been in the senses, in which, however, it is certain that the ideas of God and the soul have never been. It seems to me that people who wish to use their imagination in order to understand these ideas are doing the same as if, in order to hear sounds or smell smells, they tried to use their eyes. Except that there is this further difference, that the sense of sight no more confirms to us the reality of things than that of smell or hearing, whereas neither our imagination nor our senses could ever confirm the existence of anything, if our intellect did not play its part.  
      <br>&emsp;Finally, if there are still people who are not sufficiently convinced of the existence of God and of their soul by the arguments I have adduced, I would have them know that everything else of which they think they can be more certain, such as their having a body, or there being stars and an earth and suchlike, is in fact less certain. For although for all practical purposes we possess an assurance of these things such that it seems that no one can doubt their existence without being wilfully eccentric, nevertheless, where metaphysical certainty is in question, no one can deny, short of being irrational, that there are sufficient grounds for not being absolutely certain, as when we note that while we are asleep we can in the same way imagine having another body, or seeing other stars and another earth, without this being in fact the case. For how do we know that the thoughts that come to us in dreams are any more false than the others, seeing that they are often no less vivid and clear? However much the best minds choose to investigate this matter, I do not believe that they will be able to furnish any argument which is sufficient to remove this doubt, unless they presuppose the existence of God. For, in the first place, even the rule which I stated above that I held—namely, that the things that we conceive very clearly and very distinctly are all true—is only certain because God is or exists, because He is a perfect being, and because everything that is in us comes from Him. From which it follows that our ideas or notions, being real things which moreover come from God, insofar as they are clear and distinct, cannot thereby but be true. So that if we quite often have ideas containing some falsity, these can only be those which contain something in some way confused or obscure, because in this they participate in nothingness, that is to say, that they are in us in this confused form because we are not wholly perfect. And it is manifest that there is no less contradiction in the proposition that falsity and imperfection as such come from God, than there is in the proposition that truth or perfection come from nothingness. But if we did not know that everything that is real and true in us comes from a perfect and infinite being, then, no matter how clear and distinct our ideas were, we would have no reason to be assured that they possess the perfection of being true.  
      <br>&emsp;Now once the knowledge of God and of the soul has made us certain of this rule, it is a simple matter to determine that the things we imagine in dreams should in no way make us doubt the truth of the thoughts we have while awake. For even if one should happen while sleeping to have some very distinct idea, as for example, in the case of a geometer discovering some new proof, the fact that he was asleep would not prevent it being true. And as for the most common error of our dreams, which consists in their representing various things to us in the same way as our external senses, it does not matter that it gives us occasion to distrust the truth of such ideas, because our senses could also quite often mislead us without our being asleep; as when those who suffer from jaundice see everything as yellow, or when stars or other very distant bodies appear to us much smaller than they are. For after all, whether we are awake or asleep, we ought never to let ourselves be convinced except on the evidence of our reason. And it is to be noted that I say ‘our reason’, and not ‘our imagination’ or ‘our senses’. For although we see the sun very clearly, we should not on that account judge that it is only as large as we see it; and we can well imagine the head of a lion grafted onto the body of a goat, without having necessarily to conclude from this that a chimera exists in the world; for reason does not dictate to us that what we see or imagine in this way is true. But it does certainly dictate that all our ideas or notions must have some foundation in truth; for it would not otherwise be possible that God, who is all-perfect and altogether true, should have placed them in us unless it were so. Our processes of reasoning are never so clear or so complete while we are asleep as when we are awake (even though our imaginings in sleep are sometimes just as vivid and distinct); so reason tells us also that as our thoughts cannot all be true because we are not wholly perfect, what truth there is in them must infallibly be found in those we have while awake rather than in those we have in our dreams.  
  
  </div>
  <div class="content-text hidden" id="PARTFIVE">
      I would gladly go on and reveal the whole chain of the other truths that I deduced from these first ones. But in order to achieve this end, it would be necessary here for me to broach several questions that are controversial among learned men with whom I do not wish to fall out, and so I believe it would be best for me to abstain from doing this, and state only in broad terms what these questions are, in order to leave wiser heads to judge whether it would be profitable for the public to be informed about them in greater detail. I have always stuck to the decision I took not to posit any principle other than that which I have just used to prove the existence of God and of the soul, and not to take anything to be true which did not seem to me clearer and more certain than the proofs of geometers had previously seemed. And yet I venture to say that I have not only found the way to satisfy myself in a short space of time about all the principal difficulties usually discussed in philosophy, but I have also come to see certain laws which God has established in such a way in nature, and of which He has imprinted notions of such a kind in our souls, that after sufficient reflection on them, we cannot doubt that they are strictly observed in everything that exists or occurs in the world. Moreover, by considering what follows from these laws, it seems to me that I have discovered many truths more useful and important than anything I had hitherto learned or even hoped to learn.  
      <br>&emsp;But since I tried to explain the most important of these in a treatise which certain considerations prevent me from publishing, I cannot let them be known better than by saying here briefly what the treatise contains. Before I started writing it, I had intended to include in it everything that I believed I knew about the nature of material things. But just like those painters who, being unable to represent equally in a flat picture all the various faces of a solid body, choose only one of the principal ones which they place in the light, leaving the others in shadow, representing them to the extent that one can see them when one looks at the chosen face; so also, fearing that I could not put everything that I had in my mind in my discourse, I undertook only to reveal fully my conception of light; thereafter, I took the opportunity of adding something about the sun and the fixed stars, because light proceeds almost wholly from them; something about the heavens, because they transmit it; something about the planets, the comets, and the earth, because they reflect it; and in particular something about terrestrial bodies, because they are either coloured, or transparent, or luminous; and finally something about man, because he is the spectator of all this. And in order to remove these things from the spotlight and to be able to say more freely what I thought about them without being obliged either to confirm or refute the opinions of learned men, I decided to leave this earth wholly for them to discuss, and to speak only of what would happen in a new world, if God were now to create enough matter to compose it somewhere in imaginary space, and if He were to agitate the different parts of this matter in diverse and indiscriminate ways so as to create from it a chaos as confused as any poet could possibly imagine; and that He then did no more than sustain nature in His usual manner, leaving it to act according to the laws He has established. So I first described this matter and tried to represent it so that there is nothing in the world, I think, clearer and more intelligible, except what has just been said of God and the soul; for I even made the explicit supposition expressly that it contained none of the forms or qualities which are discussed by scholastic philosophers, and that it had nothing in general that was not so naturally known to our souls that we could not even pretend to be ignorant of it. Further, I revealed what were the laws of nature; and basing my reasoning on no other principle than the infinite perfections of God, I set out to prove all those laws about which one might have had some doubt, and to show that they are such that even if God had created many worlds, there could be not be any in which they could have failed to be observed. After that, I demonstrated how the greater part of the matter of this chaos must, in consequence of these laws, be disposed and arranged in a way which made it similar to the heavens above us; how, at the same time, some of its parts had to compose an earth, some others planets and comets, yet others a sun and fixed stars. And here, enlarging on the subject of light, I explained in detail the nature of the light to be found in the sun and the heavenly bodies, the way it crossed in an instant the immense expanses of the heavens, and how it was reflected from the planets and the comets towards the earth. I added also many things about the substance, position, motions, and all the various qualities of these heavens and stars; so that I thought I had said enough to show that nothing was to be observed in those of our world which must not or at least could not appear wholly similar to the world I was describing. Next, I came to speak about the earth in particular, and to discuss how, although I had made the explicit supposition that God conferred no weight on the matter of which it was composed, all its parts nonetheless tended exactly towards its centre; how, there being water and air on its surface, the dispositions of the heavens and the heavenly bodies (principally the moon) must cause tidal movement similar in every circumstance to that which we observe in our seas; and together with all this, a certain current, as much of the water as of the air, from east to west, such as we find here in our tropics; how mountains, seas, springs, and rivers could naturally form themselves, metals appear in the mines, plants grow in the countryside, and in general, how all the bodies that are called mixed or composed come into being there. And among other things, because apart from the heavenly bodies I knew of nothing in the world which produces light apart from fire, I set out to explain very clearly everything which pertains to its nature, how it comes about and how it sustains itself; how there is sometimes only heat without light and sometimes only light without heat; how it can introduce different colours and various other qualities into different bodies; how it melts some things and hardens others, how it can consume nearly all of them or turn them into ashes and smoke; and finally, how it can form glass from these ashes, by nothing other than the power of its action. I took particular pleasure in describing this, for the transmutation of ashes into glass seemed to me as remarkable a transformation as any that occurs in nature.  
      <br>&emsp;Yet I did not wish to infer from all this that our world was created in the way I suggested; for it is much more plausible that from the beginning God made it as it was to be. But it is certain (and this is an opinion widely held among theologians) that the act by which He conserves the world is the same as that by which He created it. So, even if He might not have given it any other form at the beginning than chaos, provided that He established the laws of nature and gave nature the help to act as it usually acts, we may believe, without casting doubt upon the miracle of creation, that all purely material things would have been able, in time, to make themselves into what we see them to be at present in this way alone. And their nature is much easier to conceive of, when we think of their gradual emergence in this way, than when we only consider them in their final form.  
      <br>&emsp;From the description of inanimate bodies and plants I passed to that of animals, and in particular to that of men. But because I did not yet know enough to speak about it in the same way as I did about the rest, that is to say, by proving effects from causes, and showing from what elements and by what process nature must produce them, I contented myself with the supposition that God formed the body of a man, exactly like our own both in the external shape of his members and in the internal configuration of his organs, constituting him of no other matter than that which I had already described, and without placing in him in the beginning a rational soul, or anything else which could function as a vegetative or sensitive soul, but merely kindling in his heart one of those fires without light which I had already explained and whose nature I conceived of as no different from the fire that heats hay when it has been stored before it was dry, or makes new wine rise in temperature, when it is left to ferment on the lees. For, in investigating the functions that could as a consequence be in this body, I found precisely all those which can be in us without our thinking of them, and to which our soul, that is to say, that part of us distinct from the body whose sole nature, as has been said above, is to think, contributes nothing; these functions are the same as those in which irrational animals may be said to resemble us. But I was unable to find in this body any of those functions which, being dependent on thought, are the only ones that belong to us as human beings, whereas I found them all there subsequently, once I had supposed that God created a rational soul and that He joined it to this body in a particular way which I described.  
      <br>&emsp;But so that one may see how I dealt with this matter, I wish to give here the explanation of the movement of the heart and the arteries, from which, being the first and most general movement that is observed in animals, readers will determine more easily what they must think about all the others. And so that they might have less difficulty understanding what I shall say about it, I should like those who are unversed in anatomy to take the trouble, before reading this, of having the heart of a large animal with lungs dissected before their eyes (for it is in all respects sufficiently like that of a man) and of having its two chambers or cavities pointed out to them. First, the one which is on the right side, to which two very wide tubes are connected; that is, the vena cava, which is the principal receptacle of blood and, as it were, the trunk of the tree of which all other veins in the body are the branches; and the vena arteriosa, which has been ill-named, being in fact an artery, which has its origin in the heart, and having emerged from it, divides into many branches that spread throughout the lungs. Next, the cavity on the left side, to which two tubes are connected in the same way, which are as wide or wider than the preceding ones; that is, the arteria venosa, which has also been ill-named, because it is nothing other than a vein, which comes from the lungs where it is divided into many branches, intertwined with those of the vena arteriosa, and those with the tube called the trachea through which the air we breathe enters; and the aorta which, coming out from the heart, sends its branches throughout the body. I should also like my readers to be shown carefully the eleven small membranes which, like so many little doors, open and close the four apertures which are in these two cavities; namely, three at the entrance to the vena cava, where they are so disposed that they cannot prevent the blood it contains from flowing into the right cavity of the heart and yet at the same time completely stop the blood from leaving it; three at the entrance to the vena arteriosa, which, being disposed in the opposite way, allow the blood in that cavity to pass into the lungs, but stop the blood in the lungs from returning to the heart; and two others at the entrance to the arteria venosa, which allow in the same way the blood from the lungs to flow towards the left cavity of the heart, but prevent it from returning; and three at the entrance to the aorta, which allow blood to leave the heart but stop it returning. And there is no need to look for any other cause for the number of these membranes other than that the aperture of the arteria venosa, being oval in shape on account of its location, can easily be closed with two of them, whereas the others, being round, can more easily be closed with three. Moreover, I would wish my readers to have pointed out to them that the aorta and the vena arteriosa are of a much harder and firmer texture than the arteria venosa and the vena cava, and that these latter two widen out before entering the heart to form two pouches, as it were, called the auricles of the heart, which are composed of similar substance to the heart itself. They will observe also that there is always more heat in the heart than in any other part of the body; and finally, that this heat is able to cause a drop of blood entering its cavities to swell up at once and to dilate, in the same way that all liquids do when they are allowed to fall drop by drop into a very hot vessel.  
      <br>&emsp;I have no need after this to say more to explain the movement of the heart, except that when its cavities are not full of blood, blood necessarily flows from the vena cava into the right cavity and from the arteria venosa into the left; for these two vessels are always full of blood, and their apertures, which open into the heart, cannot then be blocked; but, as soon as two drops of blood have entered the heart in this way, one into each cavity, these drops (which must very great, since the apertures by which they enter are very wide and the vessels from which they come are full of blood) rarify and dilate because of the heat they find there. In this way they cause the whole heart to swell, and they push shut the five little doors which are at the entrances of the two vessels from which they flowed, thus preventing any more blood coming down into the heart. Continuing to become more and more rarified, the drops of blood push open the six other little doors which are at the entrances of the two other vessels through which the blood leaves the heart, causing in this way all the branches of the vena arteriosa and the aorta to swell at more or less the same time as the heart. Immediately afterwards the heart contracts, as do these arteries also, because the blood that has entered them has cooled, and their six little doors shut again; and the five doors of the vena cava and the arteria venosa open again and allow two new quantities of blood to pass through, which immediately cause the heart and the arteries to swell up as before. And because the blood that enters the heart in this way, passes through the two pouches which are called auricles, it follows from this that their movement is the opposite of the heart’s, and that they contract when the heart swells. Finally, so that those who do not know the force of mathematical proof and are not used to distinguish true reasoning from plausible reasoning, should not venture to deny all this without examining it, I would like to point out to them that the movement I have just explained follows necessarily from the mere disposition of organs that one can see with the naked eye in the heart, from the heat which one can feel there with one’s fingers, and from the nature of blood which one can know from observation, in the same way as the movement of a clock follows from the force, position, and shape of its counterweights and wheels.  
      <br>&emsp;But if one asks why the blood in the veins is not all used up by flowing continually in this way into the heart, and why the arteries are not too full because all the blood which passes through the heart goes into them, I need only repeat the answer already given by an English doctor, who must be praised for having broken the ice on this subject. He was the first to show that there are many small passages at the extremities of the arteries through which the blood they receive from the heart enters the small branches of the veins, from which it immediately goes back to the heart, so that its course is nothing but a perpetual circulation. He proves this very well from the common experience of surgeons, who, having bound an arm moderately tightly above the point where they open a vein, make the blood flow out more abundantly than if they had not bound the arm. And the opposite would happen if they bound the arm below, between the hand and the vein being opened, or if they bound it very tightly above. For it is obvious that the moderately tight ligature, while being able to prevent the blood that is already in the veins from returning to the heart through the veins, cannot stop on that account fresh blood arriving from the arteries, because they are situated below the veins and their walls, being harder, are less easy to compress; and because the blood coming from the heart tends to flow through the arteries to the hand with greater force than it does when returning from the hand towards the heart through the veins. And because the blood comes out of the arm through the opening in one of the veins, there must necessarily be some passages below the ligature, that is to say, towards the extremities of the arm, through which it can come from the arteries. He also proves very well what he says about the circulation of the blood, first by certain small membranes which are disposed at various points along the veins in such a way that they do not let blood pass from the centre of the body towards its extremities, but only permit it to return from the extremities towards the heart; second, by the experiment that shows that all the blood in the body can flow out of it in a very short space of time by a single artery when it is cut, even if it is tightly bound close to the heart, and cut between the heart and the ligature, so that there is no reason to imagine that the blood that flows out comes from anywhere but the heart.  
      <br>&emsp;But there are many other things which are evidence of the fact that the true cause of this movement of the blood is as I have said it is. First, there is the difference to be observed between the blood which issues from the veins and that which issues from the arteries; this can only be due to the fact that, being rarefied, and, as it were, distilled in passing through the heart, it is thinner, more lively, and hotter straight after leaving it (that is to say, while in the arteries), than it is shortly before entering the heart (that is to say, while in the veins). And if one makes a careful observation, one will find this difference is only clearly perceptible close to the heart and not as perceptible in the parts most distant from it. Next, the hardness of the walls of which the vena arteriosa and the aorta are composed indicates clearly enough that blood beats against these more powerfully than against the veins. And why should the left cavity of the heart and the aorta be larger and wider than the right cavity and the vena arteriosa, if not because the blood of the arteria venosa, having been in the lungs only since it left the heart, is thinner and becomes more easily rarefied than the blood which flows directly from the vena cava? And what can physicians find out from taking the pulse if they did not know that, as the nature of blood changes, it can be rarefied by the heat of the heart to a greater or lesser degree and more or less quickly than before? And if we examine how this heat communicates itself to the other members of the body, must we not admit that this happens by means of the blood which is reheated as it passes through the heart and spreads from there throughout the body? From which it follows that, if we remove blood from some part of the body, we remove heat by the same means as well, and even if the heart were as hot as a piece of glowing iron, it would not have sufficient heat to warm up the hands and feet as it does at present, unless it continually sent new blood to them. Then, too, we know from this that the true function of breathing is to bring enough fresh air into the lungs to cause the blood entering them from the right cavity into the heart, where it has been rarefied and, as it were, changed into vapour, to thicken up and convert itself once more into blood, before falling back into the left cavity; if it did not do this, it would not be fit to nourish the fire that is there. All this is confirmed by the fact that we see that animals not having lungs have also only one cavity in the heart, and that unborn children, who cannot use their lungs while in their mother’s womb, have an aperture through which blood flows from the vena cava into the left cavity of the heart, and a duct by which it comes from the vena arteriosa to the aorta, without passing through the lung. And then, how could digestion occur in the stomach, if the heart did not send heat there through the arteries, together with some of the most fluid parts of the blood, which help to dissolve the food that we have ingested? And is it not easy to understand the action which converts the juice of this food into blood, if we consider that the blood is distilled perhaps more than one or two hundred times every day by passing repeatedly through the heart? And what else is needed to explain nutrition and the production of the various humours present in the body other than to say that the force with which the blood passes, as it rarefies, from the heart to the extremities of the arteries, causes some of its parts to come to rest in the parts of the members in which they then find themselves and there take the place of other parts which they expel; and that, according to the position, shape, or small size of the pores they encounter, some parts of the blood rather than others flow to certain places, in the same way that we see that sieves with different grades of mesh serve to separate different grains from each other? And finally, the most remarkable thing about all this is the generation of animal spirits, which, like a very subtle wind, or rather like a very pure and living flame, rise continually in great abundance from the heart to the brain, pass from there through the nerves into the muscles, and impart movement to all our members. We do not need to suppose any other cause to impel the most agitated and the most penetrating parts of the blood (and hence the best suited to compose these spirits) to make their way to the brain rather than anywhere else, than that the arteries that carry them there are those which come most directly from the heart, and that, according to the rules of mechanics (which are the same as those of nature), when many things tend to move together towards the same place in which there is not room for them all (as in the case of the parts of the blood that leave the left cavity of the heart and flow towards the brain), the weaker or less agitated must of necessity be displaced by the stronger, which by this means reach their destination on their own.  
      <br>&emsp;I had explained all these matters in considerable detail in the treatise which I had earlier intended to publish. And I had then shown what structure the nerves and the muscles of the human body must have to enable the animal spirits, being inside that body, to have the power to move its members, as we observe in the case of severed heads, which we can see moving and biting the earth shortly after having been cut off, although they are no longer animate. I had also shown what changes must occur in the brain to cause states of waking, sleeping, and dreaming; how light, sounds, smells, tastes, heat, and all the other qualities of external objects can imprint various ideas on the brain through the intermediary of the senses; how hunger, thirst, and the other internal passions can also transmit ideas to the brain; what must be taken to be the sensus communis in which these are received, the memory which preserves them, and the faculty of imagination, which can change them in different ways, form them into new ideas and, by the same means, distribute animal spirits to the muscles and make the members of this body move, with respect both to the objects which present themselves to the senses and to the internal passions, in as many different ways as the parts of our bodies can move without being directed by our will. This will not appear at all strange to those who know how wide a range of different automata or moving machines the skill of man can make using only very few parts, in comparison to the great number of bones, muscles, nerves, arteries, veins, and all the other parts which are in the body of every animal. For they will consider this body as a machine which, having been made by the hand of God, is incomparably better ordered and has in itself more amazing movements than any that can be created by men.  
      <br>&emsp;At this point I had dwelt on this issue to show that if there were such machines having the organs and outward shape of a monkey or any other irrational animal, we would have no means of knowing that they were not of exactly the same nature as these animals, whereas, if any such machines resembled us in body and imitated our actions insofar as this was practically possible, we should still have two very certain means of recognizing that they were not, for all that, real human beings. The first is that they would never be able to use words or other signs by composing them as we do to declare our thoughts to others. For we can well conceive of a machine made in such a way that it emits words, and even utters them about bodily actions which bring about some corresponding change in its organs (if, for example, we touch it on a given spot, it will ask what we want of it; or if we touch it somewhere else, it will cry out that we are hurting it, and so on); but it is not conceivable that it should put these words in different orders to correspond to the meaning of things said in its presence, as even the most dull-witted of men can do. And the second means is that, although such machines might do many things as well or even better than any of us, they would inevitably fail to do some others, by which we would discover that they did not act consciously, but only because their organs were disposed in a certain way. For, whereas reason is a universal instrument which can operate in all sorts of situations, their organs have to have a particular disposition for each particular action, from which it follows that it is practically impossible for there to be enough different organs in a machine to cause it to act in all of life’s occurrences in the same way that our reason causes us to act.  
      <br>&emsp;Now we can also determine the difference between men and animals by these two means. For it is a very remarkable fact that there are no men so dull-witted and stupid, not even madmen, that they are incapable of stringing together different words, and composing them into utterances, through which they let their thoughts be known; and, conversely, there is no other animal, no matter how perfect and well endowed by birth it may be, that can do anything similar. Nor does this arise from lack of organs, for we can see that magpies and parrots can utter words as we do, and yet cannot speak like us, that is, by showing that they are thinking what they are saying; whereas men born deaf and dumb, who are deprived as much as, or more than, animals of the organs which in others serve for speech, usually invent certain signs to make themselves understood by those who are their habitual companions and have the time to learn their language. This shows not only that animals have less reason than man, but that they have none at all. For it is clear that we need very little reason in order to be able to speak; and given that as much inequality is found among animals of the same species as among men, and that some are easier to train than others, it is unbelievable that the most perfect monkey or parrot of their species should not be able to speak as well as the most stupid child, or at least a child with a disturbed brain, unless their soul were of a wholly different nature to ours. And speech must not be confused with the natural movements that are signs of passion and can be imitated by machines as well by as animals; neither must one imagine, as did certain ancient thinkers, that animals speak, although we do not understand their language. For if that were true, they would be able to make themselves understood by us as well as by other members of their species, since they have many organs that correspond to ours. It is also a very remarkable fact that although many animals show more skill in some of their actions than we correspondingly do, it is nonetheless clear than the same animals show none at all in many others, so that what they can do better than us does not prove that they have any mental powers, for it would follow from this that they would have more intelligence than any of us, and would surpass us in everything. Rather, it shows that they have no mental powers whatsoever, and that it is nature which acts in them, according to the disposition of their organs; just as we see that a clock consisting only of ropes and springs can count the hours and measure time more accurately than we can in spite of all our wisdom.  
      <br>&emsp;Following this, I had described the rational soul, and shown that, unlike the other things of which I had spoken, it could not possibly be derived from the potentiality of matter, but that it must have been created expressly. And I had shown how it is not sufficient for it to be lodged in the human body like a pilot in his ship, except perhaps to move its members, but that it needs to be more closely joined and united with the body in order to have, in addition, feelings and appetites like the ones we have, and in this way compose a true man. I dwelt a little at this point on the subject of the soul, because it is of the greatest importance. For, after the error of those who deny the existence of God, which I believe I have adequately refuted above, there is none which causes weak minds to stray more readily from the narrow path of virtue than that of imagining that the souls of animals are of the same nature as our own, and that, as a consequence, we have nothing more to fear or to hope for after this present life, any more than flies and ants. But when we know how different flies and ants are, we can understand much better the arguments which prove that our soul is of a nature entirely independent of the body, and that, as a consequence, it is not subject to death as the body is. And given that we cannot see any other causes which may destroy the soul, we are naturally led to conclude that it is immortal.

  <div class="content-text hidden" id="PARTSIX">
      <br>&emsp;It is now three years since I completed the treatise that contained all the above. I was beginning to revise it so that I could place it in the hands of a printer, when I learned that persons to whom I defer, and whose authority holds hardly less sway over my actions than my own reason over my thoughts, had condemned a physical theory, published a little earlier by someone else, to which I would not want to go so far as to say I subscribed, but only that I had seen nothing in it before their act of censure which I could imagine being prejudicial to religion or state, and which consequently would have prevented me from writing about it, if my reason had persuaded me to do so. This made me fear that there might be one of my own opinions in which I was equally mistaken, notwithstanding the great care I have always taken never to accept any new opinions for which I did not have very certain proof, and not to write about any which might work to the disadvantage of anyone. This was enough to make me change the decision I had taken to publish my theories. For even if the reasons for taking the decision earlier to publish were very strong, my natural inclination, which has always made me dislike the business of writing books, led me to find a host of other reasons for excusing myself from doing so. And these reasons, both for and against, are such that not only do I have some interest in declaring them here, but the public may also have some interest in knowing what they are.  
      <br>&emsp;I have never laid great store by the products of my mind, and as long as I reaped no other benefits from the method that I use (apart from satisfying myself about some problems that belong to the speculative sciences, or trying to direct my life by the precepts that it inculcated in me), I have not felt obliged to write anything about it. For as far as mode of life is concerned, everyone is so sure that they know best that one could find as many reformers as there are people, if it were permitted to any other than those whom God has established as sovereigns over their peoples, or those to whom He has given sufficient grace and zeal to be prophets, to set about changing anything. And although I was very pleased with my speculations, I believed that others had their own which perhaps pleased them even more. But having no sooner acquired some general notions about physics, and begun to test them out on various particular problems, I noticed where they may lead and how much they differ from the principles that have been employed up to now, and I believed that I could not keep them hidden without sinning greatly against the law that obliges us to procure, as far as it is in our power, the general good of all mankind. For these notions have made me see that it is possible to attain knowledge which is very useful in life, and that unlike the speculative philosophy that is taught in the schools, it can be turned into a practice by which, knowing the power and action of fire, water, air, stars, the heavens, and all the other bodies that are around us as distinctly as we know the different trades of our craftsmen, we could put them to all the uses for which they are suited and thus make ourselves as it were the masters and possessors of nature. This is not only desirable for the discovery of a host of inventions which will lead us effortlessly to enjoy the fruits of the earth and all the commodities that can be found in it, but principally also for the preservation of health, which is without doubt the highest good and the foundation of all the other goods of this life. For even the mind depends so much on the temperament and disposition of the organs of the body that, if it is possible to find some way of making men in most cases wiser and more skilful than they have been hitherto, I believe that it is in medicine that it must be sought. It is true that medicine as presently practised contains little of such notable benefit; but without wishing to disparage it, I am certain that there is no one, even among those whose profession it is, who will not admit that what is known about it is almost nothing compared to what remains to be known, and that it would be possible to be free of innumerable illnesses of both body and mind, and perhaps even the decline of old age, if we knew enough about their causes and the remedies with which nature has provided us. So, intending to devote my whole life to the pursuit of such an indispensable branch of knowledge, and having found a path which, I think, will inevitably lead me to it, unless prevented from doing so by the brevity of life or the lack of empirical information, I judged that there was no better remedy against these two obstacles than to communicate faithfully to the public what little I had discovered, and to urge good minds to try to go further by contributing, each according to his inclinations and power, to the observations and experiments that need to be undertaken, and by communicating in turn to the public everything that they learn. Thus, as the last would start from where their predecessors had left off, thereby combining the lives and labours of many, we might together make much greater progress than any one man could make on his own.  
      <br>&emsp;I noted, moreover, in respect of observations and experiments, that the further we progress in knowledge the more necessary they become. For, at the beginning, rather than to seek out rarer and more contrived experiments, it is better to undertake only those which communicate themselves directly to our senses, of which we cannot remain ignorant, provided that we reflect a little on them. The reason for this is that rarer experiments often mislead us, at a time when we do not still know the causes of more common ones, and the circumstances on which they depend are nearly always so specific and minute that it is difficult to take good note of them. But the order to which I have adhered in this regard is the following. First, I have tried to find in general the principles or first causes of everything that exists or can exist the world, without considering to this end anything other than God alone, who has created it, and deriving these principles only from certain seeds of truths which are naturally in our souls. After that, I came to examine what are the first and most common effects which one can deduce from these causes; and it seems to me that I have in this way discovered the heavens, heavenly bodies, and an earth; and, on the earth, water, air, fire, minerals, and several other such things which are the most common and the simplest of all, and hence the easiest to know. Then, when I wanted to proceed to more particular things, so many different ones presented themselves to me that I did not believe it possible for the human mind to distinguish the Forms or Species of bodies that are on the earth from a host of others which might be there, if it had been the will of God to put them there. Consequently, I did not think there was any other way to make them useful to us, than by progressing from effects to causes and by engaging in many individual observations. Following which, I cast my mind over all the objects that had ever presented themselves to my senses, and I venture to declare that I have not noticed anything which I could not explain quite easily by the principles I had found. But I must also acknowledge that the power of nature is so ample and vast, and these principles so simple and general, that I am able to observe hardly any particular effect without knowing from the beginning that it can be deduced from the principles in many different ways, and that my greatest difficulty is normally to find in which of these ways the effect depends on them. For I know of no other means of achieving this than by seeking further experiments and observations, whose results will vary according to the way the effect depends on my principles. For the rest, I have now reached the point where I think I can see quite clearly from which angle to approach most of the experiments and observations which can serve this end. But I can see also that they are of such a kind and in so great a number, that neither my industry nor my income (even if it were a thousand times greater than it is) could suffice for all of them. And so I will progress to a greater or lesser degree in knowledge of nature, according to the means that I have from now on to undertake more or less of them. I undertook to myself to make this known in the treatise I had written, and to show so clearly the use the public may derive from it, that I would oblige all those who desire the good of mankind in general (that is to say, all those who are truly virtuous and do not just pretend to be, or just have that reputation) both to communicate to me the experiments and observations in which they have engaged and to help me in determining those which still need to be done.  
      <br>&emsp;Since that time I have, however, had other reasons to make me change my mind and decide that I had indeed to go on recording everything that I thought of some importance as I discovered the truth about it, and to bring the same care to this task as if I intended to publish my results; as much in order to have more opportunity to examine them (as, without doubt, we always take greater care over what we think will be seen by many people than over what we do only for ourselves; and things which have seemed true to me when I began to think them out, have often seemed false when I have tried to set them down on paper), as to lose no opportunity to benefit the public, if I can, so that, if my writings are of any value whatsoever, those who will come into possession of them after my death will be able to make the most appropriate use of them. But I decided that I must never agree to them being published during my lifetime, to avoid being given occasion to waste the time I intend to use in acquiring knowledge, either on the opposition or the controversy to which they might be subject, or as a result of whatever reputation they might bring me. For although every man is indeed bound to procure the good of others insofar as it is within his power, and we are, in the true meaning of the word, worthless if we are of no use to anyone else, yet it is also true that our efforts have to reach out beyond the present time, and that it is acceptable to omit doing things which might bring some benefit to our contemporaries, when this is done in order to bring greater benefit to our grandchildren. I would also like it to be known that the little I have learnt up to now is almost nothing in comparison with what I do not know, and what I have not yet given up the hope of coming to know; for those who gradually discover truth in the sciences are more or less like people who, as they become wealthy, have less difficulty in making great acquisitions than they had earlier in making much smaller ones, when poorer. Or they can also be compared to military commanders, whose forces usually grow in proportion to their victories, and who need more skill to maintain their position after defeat in battle than they need to take towns and provinces after a victory. For to try to overcome all the problems and errors that prevent us attaining knowledge of the truth is indeed to engage in battle. And when we embrace some false opinion on a quite general and important matter, it is equivalent to losing one; much more skill is needed thereafter to regain the position we were in before, than in making great strides forward when we are already in possession of principles which are certain. For my part, if I have so far discovered a number of truths in the sciences (and I hope that the contents of this volume will cause people to think that I have indeed found a few), I can say that they merely result from and depend on my having overcome five or six principal difficulties, which I look on as so many battles in which I had good fortune to be on the winning side. I even dare speculate that I need only to win two or three others similar to these to fulfil my aims completely; and that I am not so advanced in age that I may not still have, in the ordinary course of nature, enough leisure to achieve this. But the greater the hope I have of being able to spend the time that remains to me usefully, the more I see myself obliged to manage it carefully; and I would without doubt have many opportunities of wasting it, if I were to publish the foundations of my physics. For although they are nearly all so incontrovertible that one would only have to be apprised of them to believe them, and although there is not one among them which I do not think that I could prove, yet, since it is impossible that every one of them will be in agreement with all the different opinions of others, I foresee that I would be often distracted from my work by the hostile reactions to which they would give rise.  
      <br>&emsp;One might say that this opposition would be useful, as much to make my errors known to me as to allow others, if I had got something right, to understand it better; and since many can see more than one man can see by himself, it would allow them to help me with their discoveries as they began to use my own. But although I acknowledge that I am extremely prone to error, and that I almost never trust the first thoughts that come to me, nevertheless, the experience I have of the objections that can be made to my work prevents me from expecting any benefit from them. I have already often encountered the judgements, not only of those whom I have held to be my friends and some I thought indifferent to me, but also of certain others who, through malice and envy, would strive to expose what my friends did not see because of their affection for me. But it has rarely happened that objections have been made which I had not at all foreseen, except those which were not in any way pertinent to my work. Thus, I have almost never come across a critic of my opinions who did not seem either less exacting or less fair than myself. Nor have I ever found any previously unknown truth by means of the disputations that are practised in the schools; for as long as the participants are trying to win, they are more concerned to make plausibility count than to weigh the two sides of the argument; and those who have long been good advocates do not necessarily go on to make better judges.  
      <br>&emsp;As for the benefit that others would receive from my thoughts being communicated to them, it might not be very great, seeing that I have not yet taken them so far that there is not much that needs to be added to them before putting them into practice. And I believe that I can say without vanity that if there is anyone capable of undertaking this, it must be myself rather than someone else; not that there may not be incomparably better minds than mine in the world, but because we cannot so well grasp something and make it our own when we learn it from someone else as when we discover it ourselves. This is so true in this case that, although I have often explained some of my opinions to people endowed with very fine minds, and who, as I was telling them about them, seemed to understand them very clearly, yet when they repeated them back to me, I noticed that they had nearly always changed them in such a way that I could no longer acknowledge them as my own. I should like here to take this opportunity of asking future generations never to believe that I am the source of the opinions people may tell them are mine, unless I have myself published them. I am in no way surprised by the extraordinary things which are attributed to all the ancient philosophers whose writings have not come down to us, nor do I conclude from this that their thoughts were very irrational (given that they were the best minds of their age), but only that they have been inaccurately reported to us. We see, too, that it has almost never happened that any of their disciples have surpassed them; and I am sure that the most passionate present-day followers of Aristotle would count themselves fortunate if they had as much knowledge of nature as he had, even on the condition that they would never have more. They are like ivy, which tends never to grow higher than the trees that support it, and often even grows back down once it has reached their tops. For it seems to me that modern Aristotelians also come back down, that is, make themselves in a certain way less knowledgeable than if they had abstained from study. Not content with knowing all that is intelligibly explained in their author, they wish, in addition, to find in his writings the solution to many problems about which he says nothing and to which he perhaps never gave any thought. However, their manner of philosophizing is very convenient to those who only have mediocre minds; for the obscurity of the distinctions and the principles which they use makes it possible for them to speak about the whole range of knowledge as boldly as if they really knew it all, and to maintain everything that they say against the subtlest and shrewdest thinkers, without there being a means of causing them to change their minds. In this they seem to be like blind men who, in order to fight on equal terms against those who can see, lure them into the depths of some very dark cellar. I may say that it is in the interest of these people that I abstain from publishing the principles of philosophy that I use; for as they are very simple and very certain, I would be doing the same in publishing them as opening some windows, and letting the light of day into the cellar into which they have gone down to fight. But even the best minds have no reason to wish to know my principles; for if they want to be able to speak about everything and acquire the reputation of being learned, they will achieve this more easily by contenting themselves with plausibility, which can without great difficulty be found in all kinds of matters, than in seeking the truth, which is revealed only gradually in a few, and which requires, in any discussion of the others, that one frankly acknowledge one’s ignorance. If they prefer the knowledge of a few truths to the vanity of appearing to know everything (and the former is, without doubt, preferable), and if they wish to pursue a project similar to mine, they do not in that case need me to say anything more to them than what I have already said in this discourse. For if they are capable of going beyond what I have done, they will be a fortiori capable of finding out for themselves everything I think I have discovered. And as I have never examined anything except in an orderly way, what remains for me to discover is in itself certainly more difficult and more hidden than what I have been able to discover up to now, and they would have much less pleasure in learning it from me than for themselves. Besides, the habit they will acquire of investigating easy things first and then progressing by degrees to other, more difficult matters will be of more use to them than all my instruction could be. And for my part, I am convinced that if I had been taught from my earliest years all the truths which I have since sought to prove, and had found no difficulty in learning them, I might perhaps never have known any others; or at least I would never have acquired the habit and facility which I think I have of always finding new ones, as I proceed to apply myself to search for them. In a word, if there were in the world any one task which could not be better accomplished by anyone other than the person who began it, it is the one on which I am working.  
      <br>&emsp;Admittedly, as regards the experiments and observations that may be of use to this task, one man alone could not possibly do them all; but equally, he could not usefully employ other hands than his own, except those of artisans or such persons as he could pay, in whom the hope of gain (a very effective spur) would make them do exactly what he told them to do. For as for volunteers, who might offer to help him out of curiosity or a desire to learn, apart from usually promising more than they end up giving, and having fine proposals, none of which comes to fruition, they would inevitably wish to be rewarded by having certain problems explained to them, or at least by compliments and vapid conversations which could not cost him so little time that he would not lose out by their involvement. And as for the experiments and observations that others have already made, even if they were willing to communicate them to him (something which those who call them secrets would never do), they involve, for the most part, so many dependent circumstances and so many superfluous ingredients that it would be very difficult for him to determine the truth in them. Besides, he would find nearly all of them so badly explained or even so false, because those who undertook them had tried to make them appear to conform to their own principles, that even if there were some of which he could make use, they could not be worth the time he would have to spend selecting them. So if there were someone in the world who was known for sure to be capable of making discoveries of the greatest importance and public benefit, and that for this reason other men tried in every way possible to help him to achieve his ends, I do not see how they could do anything else for him, except to provide him with financial support for the experiments and observations he would need to make, and, for the rest, prevent his time being wasted by importunate visits from other people. But while not being so presumptuous as to be willing to promise remarkable results, nor entertaining thoughts so vain as to imagine that the public ought to take a great interest in my projects, I do not also have so base a soul as to wish to accept from anyone whatsoever a favour which I might be deemed not to have deserved.  
      <br>&emsp;All these considerations taken together were the reason why, three years ago, I refused to publish the treatise that I had in my hands, and why I had decided not to make public any other work in my lifetime which was so general, or from which one could derive the foundations of my physics. But two other reasons have since made me include here some individual essays, and give the public some account of my actions and plans. The first is that if I failed to do so, many who know about my earlier intention to publish certain writings might imagine that the reasons why I have abstained from so doing were more to my discredit than they are. For although I am not excessively fond of glory, and even, if I dare say so, hate it, in that I judge it to be contrary to the tranquillity that I value above everything else, it is also the case that I have never tried to hide my actions as though they were crimes, nor have I taken great precautions to remain unknown; not only because I would have thought that I would be doing myself an injustice, but also because doing this would have given me a certain sort of uneasiness which would also have been opposed to the perfect peace of mind I am seeking. And because, although always having been indifferent to being well known or not known at all, I have been unable to avoid acquiring some sort of reputation, I have come to think that I must do my best to avoid having a bad one. The other reason that has made me write is that of seeing every day the project that I have, to acquire knowledge, suffering more and more delay; because of the vast number of experiments and observations I need to make, and which it is impossible for me to undertake without the help of others. Although I do not flatter myself with any expectation that the public should share my interests, I do not, on the other hand, want to fall so far below my own standards that I give those who come after me cause to reproach me one day for not having left them many things in better order than I have done, if I had neglected to make them see how they could contribute to my projects.  
      <br>&emsp;I believed it to be easy for me to choose certain matters which, without having been the subject of many controversies, nor compelling me to declare openly more of my principles than I wished, would still reveal quite clearly what I am capable, or not capable, of in the sciences. I cannot tell whether I have succeeded in this, and I do not want to prejudice anyone’s judgement by speaking myself about my writings. But I shall be very glad for them to be critically examined, and so that one might feel all the more free to do so, I beg all those who may have any objections to take the trouble of sending them to my publisher, through whom, on being informed about them, I shall try to deliver my reply at the same time. By this means readers, seeing together the objections and the replies, will be able more easily to judge where the truth lies. I do not undertake ever to make long replies, but only to admit my mistakes frankly, if I perceive them, or, if I cannot see where they lie, to say simply what I deem to be necessary in defence of what I have written, without proceeding to the explanation of any new matter, so as not to get dragged along interminably from one topic to the next.  
      <br>&emsp;If some of the things I speak about in the beginning of the Dioptrics and the Meteorology shock readers at first sight, because I call them ‘suppositions’ and do not seem to want to prove them, I ask them to have the patience to read the whole of the treatise attentively, and I hope that they will be satisfied by it. For it seems to me that my arguments follow each other in such a way that, if the last are proven by the first, which are their causes, the first are reciprocally proved by the last, which are their effects. And one must not imagine that I am committing here the fallacy that logicians call a ‘circle’; for as empirical evidence clearly confirms most of these effects, the causes from which I deduce them do not so much serve to prove them as to explain them; conversely, it is the causes that are proved by the effects. And I have called them ‘suppositions’ only to make it known that, while I think I can deduce them from the primary truths that I have explained above, I have expressly decided not to do this, in order to prevent certain thinkers from seizing the opportunity of building some new outlandish philosophy on what they believe to be my principles, for which I should be blamed; thinkers who believe that as soon as one has said only two or three words to them on a given matter, they can know in one day what it would take someone else twenty years to think out; and the more penetrating and lively these thinkers are, the more they are liable to err and the less capable they are of the truth. As for the opinions that are wholly mine, I offer no apology for their being new; for if the arguments supporting them are carefully considered, I am certain that one will find them so simple and so consistent with common sense, that they will seem less extraordinary and strange than any other opinions which one might entertain on the same subjects. I do not boast of being the first discoverer of any of them, but I do claim that I have accepted them, not because they have, or have not, been expressed by others, but only because reason persuaded me of their truth.  
      <br>&emsp;And if craftsmen are unable straight away to construct the invention explained in the Dioptrics, I do not believe that it can be said on that account to be bad. In view of the fact that it needs skill and practice to make and adjust the machines I have described, without missing out any detail, I would be no less surprised if they succeeded at the first attempt, than if someone could learn to play the lute expertly in a single day simply because he had been given a good fingering chart. And if I write in French, which is the language of my country, rather than Latin, which is that of my teachers, it is because I hope that those who use only their unalloyed natural reason will be better judges of my opinions than those who swear only by the books of the ancients. And as for those who combine good sense with application, whom alone I wish to have as my judges, I am sure they will not be so partial to Latin that they will refuse to grasp my arguments because I express them in the vulgar tongue.  
      <br>&emsp;For the rest, I do not wish to speak here in detail of the future progress I hope to make in the sciences, or commit myself to any promises to the public which I am not sure of being able to fulfil. I will simply say that I have decided to devote the rest of my life to nothing other than trying to acquire some knowledge of nature which may be such that we may derive some rules in medicine which are more reliable than those we have had up to now; and my inclination deters me so strongly from all other sorts of project, especially those which can be only useful to some by harming others, that if some situation arose which forced me to work on them, I do not believe that I would be capable of succeeding. On this I here am making a declaration that I know will not make me worthy of esteem in the world, but then I have no desire to gain it. And I shall always consider myself more obliged to those through whose favour I may freely enjoy my time without hindrance, than to those who might offer me the offices in the world which are held in the highest esteem.

 <div id="myLife">
    It is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vanity; therefore, I shall be short. It may be thought an instance of vanity that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative shall contain little more than the History of my Writings; as, indeed, almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupations. The first success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object of vanity. 
    <br>&emsp; I was born the 26th of April 1711, old style, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father’s family is a branch of the Earl of Home’s, or Hume’s; and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate, which my brother possesses, for several generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, President of the College of Justice: the title of Lord Halkerton came by succession to her brother. 
    <br>&emsp; My family, however, was not rich, and being myself a younger brother, my patrimony, according to the mode of my country, was of course very slender. My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with an elder brother and a sister, under the care of our mother, a woman of singular merit, who, though young and handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and educating of her children. I passed through the ordinary course of education with success, and was seized very early with a passion for literature, which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments. My studious disposition, my sobriety, and my industry, gave my family a notion that the law was a proper profession for me; but I found an unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and general learning; and while they fancied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring. 
    <br>&emsp; My very slender fortune, however, being unsuitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent application, I was tempted, or rather forced, to make a very feeble trial for entering into a more active scene of life. In 1734, I went to Bristol, with some recommendations to eminent merchants, but in a few months found that scene totally unsuitable to me. I went over to France, with a view of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have steadily and successfully pursued. I resolved to make a very rigid frugality supply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my independency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature. 
    <br>&emsp; During my retreat in France, first at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou, I composed my Treatise of Human Nature. After passing three years very agreeably in that country, I came over to London in 1737. In the end of 1738, I published my Treatise, and immediately went down to my mother and my brother, who lived at his country-house, and was employing himself very judiciously and successfully in the improvement of his fortune. 
    <br>&emsp; Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise of Human Nature. It fell dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction, as even to excite a murmur among the zealots. But being naturally of a cheerful and sanguine temper, I very soon recovered the blow, and prosecuted with great ardour my studies in the country. In 1742, I printed at Edinburgh the first part of my Essays: the work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my former disappointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time recovered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth. 
    <br>&emsp; In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found also, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and direction, for the state of his mind and health required it.—I lived with him a twelvemonth. My appointments during that time made a considerable accession to my small fortune. I then received an invitation from General St. Clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Canada, but ended in an incursion on the coast of France. Next year, to wit, 1747, I received an invitation from the General to attend him in the same station in his military embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform of an officer, and was introduced at these courts as aid-de-camp to the general, along with Sir Harry Erskine and Captain Grant, now General Grant. These two years were almost the only interruptions which my studies have received during the course of my life: I passed them agreeably, and in good company; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made me reach a fortune, which I called independent, though most of my friends were inclined to smile when I said so; in short, I was now master of near a thousand pounds. 
    <br>&emsp; I had always entertained a notion, that my want of success in publishing the Treatise of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early. I, therefore, cast the first part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, which was published while I was at Turin. But this piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of Human Nature. On my return from Italy, I had the mortification to find all England in a ferment, on account of Dr. Middleton’s Free Enquiry, while my performance was entirely overlooked and neglected. A new edition, which had been published at London of my Essays, moral and political, met not with a much better reception. 
    <br>&emsp; Such is the force of natural temper, that these disappointments made little or no impression on me. I went down in 1749, and lived two years with my brother at his country-house, for my mother was now dead. I there composed the second part of my Essays, which I called Political Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals, which is another part of my treatise that I cast anew. Meanwhile, my bookseller, A. Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all but the unfortunate Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of conversation; that the sale of them was gradually increasing, and that new editions were demanded. Answers by Reverends, and Right Reverends, came out two or three in a year; and I found, by Dr. Warburton’s railing, that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company. However, I had fixed a resolution, which I inflexibly maintained, never to reply to any body; and not being very irascible in my temper, I have easily kept myself clear of all literary squabbles. These symptoms of a rising reputation gave me encouragement, as I was ever more disposed to see the favourable than unfavourable side of things; a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess, than to be born to an estate of ten thousand a year. 
    <br>&emsp; In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true scene for a man of letters. In 1752, were published at Edinburgh, where I then lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful on the first publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the same year was published at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject), is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incomparably the best. It came unnoticed and unobserved into the world. 
    <br>&emsp; In 1752, the Faculty of Advocates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the History of England; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narrative through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the accession of the House of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the misrepresentations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, sanguine in my expectations of the success of this work. I thought that I was the only historian, that had at once neglected present power, interest, and authority, and the cry of popular prejudices; and as the subject was suited to every capacity, I expected proportional applause. But miserable was my disappointment: I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation; English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig and Tory, churchman and sectary, freethinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage against the man, who had presumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of Charles I. and the Earl of Strafford; and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still more mortifying, the book seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of it. I scarcely, indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, considerable for rank or letters, that could endure the book. I must only except the primate of England, Dr. Herring, and the primate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These dignified prelates separately sent me messages not to be discouraged. 
    <br>&emsp; I was, however, I confess, discouraged; and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to some provincial town of the former kingdom, have changed my name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this scheme was not now practicable, and the subsequent volume was considerably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage and to persevere. 
    <br>&emsp; In this interval, I published at London my Natural History of Religion, along with some other small pieces: its public entry was rather obscure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility, which distinguish the Warburtonian school. This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my performance. 
    <br>&emsp; In 1756, two years after the fall of the first volume, was published the second volume of my History, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This performance happened to give less displeasure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only rose itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother. 
    <br>&emsp; But though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and in literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that in above a hundred alterations, which farther study, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side. It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that period as a regular plan of liberty. 
    <br>&emsp; In 1759, I published my History of the House of Tudor. The clamour against this performance was almost equal to that against the History of the two first Stuarts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous against the impressions of public folly, and continued very peaceably and contentedly in my retreat at Edinburgh, to finish, in two volumes, the more early part of the English History, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable success. 
    <br>&emsp; But, notwithstanding this variety of winds and seasons, to which my writings had been exposed, they had still been making such advances, that the copy-money given me by the booksellers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only independent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to set my foot out of it; and retaining the satisfaction of never having preferred a request to one great man, or even making advances of friendship to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the least acquainted, to attend him on his embassy to Paris, with a near prospect of being appointed secretary to the embassy; and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This offer, however inviting, I at first declined, both because I was reluctant to begin connexions with the great, and because I was afraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris, would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humour: but on his lordship’s repeating the invitation, I accepted of it. I have every reason, both of pleasure and interest, to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his brother, General Conway. 
    <br>&emsp; Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes, will never imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and women of all ranks and stations. The more I resiled from their excessive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there for life. 
    <br>&emsp; I was appointed secretary to the embassy; and, in summer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. I was chargé d’affaires till the arrival of the Duke of Richmond, towards the end of the year. In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next summer went to Edinburgh, with the same view as formerly, of burying myself in a philosophical retreat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more money, and a much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford’s friendship, than I left it; and I was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce, as I had formerly made an experiment of a competency. But, in 1767, I received from Mr. Conway an invitation to be Under-secretary; and this invitation, both the character of the person, and my connexions with Lord Hertford, prevented me from declining. I returned to Edinburgh in 1769, very opulent (for I possessed a revenue of 1000 l.*36 a year), healthy, and though somewhat stricken in years, with the prospect of enjoying long my ease, and of seeing the increase of my reputation. 
    <br>&emsp; In spring 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little pain from my disorder; and what is more strange, have, notwithstanding the great decline of my person, never suffered a moment’s abatement of my spirits; insomuch, that were I to name the period of my life, which I should most choose to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I consider, besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities; and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation’s breaking out at last with additional lustre, I knew that I could have but few years to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present. 
    <br>&emsp; To conclude historically with my own character. I am, or rather was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments); I was, I say, a man of mild dispositions, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my temper, notwithstanding my frequent disappointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary; and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though most men any wise eminent, have found reason to complain of calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage, but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.

    SIR,-- Not being acquainted with this handwriting you will probably look to the bottom to find the subscription and not finding any will certainly wonder at this strange method of addressing to you. I must here in the beginning beg you to excuse it and to persuade you to read what follows with some attention, must tell you, that this gives you an opportunity to do a very good natured action which I believe is the most powerful argument I can use. I need not tell you that I am your countryman, a Scotsman; for without any such tie, I dare rely upon your humanity even to a perfect stranger, such as I am. The favour I beg of you is your advice, and the reason why I address myself in particular to you, need not be told,-- as one must be a skilful physician, a man of letters, of wit, of good sense, and of great humanity, to give me a satisfying answer. I wish fame had pointed out to me more persons, in whom these qualities are united, in order to have kept me some time in suspense. This I say in the sincerity of my heart, and without any intention of making a compliment; for though it may seem necessary, that, in the beginning of so unusual a letter, I should say some fine things, to bespeak your good opinion, and remove any prejudices you may conceive at it, yet such an endeavour to be witty, would ill suit with the present condition of my mind; which, I must confess, is not without anxiety concerning the judgment you will form of me. Trusting, however, to your candour and generosity, I shall, without further preface, proceed to open up to you the present condition of my health, and to do that the more effectually, shall give you a kind of history of my life, after which you will easily learn why I keep my name a secret.
    <br>&emsp;You must know then that, from my earliest infancy, I found always a strong inclination to books and letters. As our college education in Scotland, extending little further than the languages, ends commonly when we are about fourteen or fifteen years of age, I was after that left to my own choice in my reading, and found it incline me almost equally to books of reasoning and philosophy, and to poetry and the polite authors. Every one who is acquainted either with the philosophers or critics, knows that there is nothing yet established in either of these two sciences, and that they contain little more than endless disputes, even in the most fundamental articles. Upon examination of these, I found a certain boldness of temper growing in me, which was not inclined to submit to any authority in these subjects, but led me to seek out some new medium, by which truth might be established. After much study and reflection on this, at last, when I was about eighteen years of age, there seemed to be opened up to me a new scene of thought, which transported me beyond measure, and made me, with an ardour natural to young men, throw up every other pleasure or business to apply entirely to it. The law, which was the business I designed to follow, appeared nauseous to me, and I could think of no other way of pushing my fortune in the world, but that of a scholar and philosopher. I was infinitely happy in this course of life for some months; till at last, about the beginning of September, 1729, all my ardour seemed in a moment to be extinguished, and I could no longer raise my mind to that pitch, which formerly gave me such excessive pleasure. I felt no uneasiness or want of spirits, when I laid aside my book; and therefore never imagined there was any bodily distemper in the case, but that my coldness proceeded from a laziness of temper, which must be overcome by redoubling my application. In this condition I remained for nine months, very uneasy to myself, as you may well imagine, but without growing any worse, which was a miracle. There was another particular, which contributed, more than any thing, to waste my spirits and bring on me this distemper, which was, that having read many books of morality, such as Cicero, Seneca, and Plutarch, and being smit with their beautiful representations of virtue and philosophy, I undertook the improvement of my temper and will, along with my reason and understanding. I was continually fortifying myself with reflections against death, and poverty, and shame, and pain, and all the other calamities of life. These no doubt are exceeding useful, when joined with an active life, because the occasion being presented along with the reflection, works it into the soul, and makes it take a deep impression; but in solitude they serve to little other purpose, than to waste the spirits, the force of the mind meeting with no resistance, but wasting itself in the air, like our arm when it misses its aim. This, however, I did not learn but by experience, and till I had already ruined my health, though I was not sensible of it. Some scurvy spots broke out on my fingers the first winter I fell ill, about which I consulted a very knowing physician, who gave me some medicine that removed these symptoms, and at the same time gave me a warning against the vapours, which, though I was labouring under at that time, I fancied myself so far removed from, and indeed from any other disease, except a slight scurvy, that I despised his warning. At last, about April 1730, when I was nineteen years of age, a symptom, which I had noticed a little from the beginning, increased considerably; so that, though it was no uneasiness, the novelty of it made me ask advice; it was what they call a ptyalism or wateryness in the mouth. Upon my mentioning it to my physician, he laughed at me and told me I was now a brother, for that I had fairly got the disease of the learned. Of this he found great difficulty to persuade me, finding in myself nothing of that lowness of spirit, which those who labour under that distemper so much complain of. However upon his advice I went under a course of bitters and, anti-hysteric pills, drank an English pint of claret wine every day, and rode eight or ten Scotch miles. This I continued for about seven months after.
    <br>&emsp;Though I was sorry to find myself engaged with so tedious a distemper, yet the knowledge of it set me very much at ease, by satisfying me that my former coldness proceeded not from any defect of temper or genius, but from a disease to which any one may be subject. I now began to take some indulgence to myself; studied moderately, and only when I found my spirits at their highest pitch, leaving off before I was weary, and trifling away the rest of my time in the best manner I could. In this way, I lived with satisfaction enough; and on my return to town next winter found my spirits very much recruited, so that, though they sank under me in the higher flights of genius, yet I was able to make considerable progress in my former designs. I was very regular in my diet and way of life from the beginning, and all that winter made it a constant rule to ride twice or thrice-a-week, and walk every day. For these reasons, I expected, when I returned to the country, and could renew my exercise with less interruption, that I would perfectly recover. But in this I was much mistaken; for next summer, about May 1731 there grew upon me a very ravenous appetite, and as quick a digestion, which I at first took for a good symptom, and was very much surprised to find it bring back a palpitation of heart, which I had felt very little of before. This appetite, however, had an effect very unusual, which was to nourish me extremely; so that in six weeks' time, I passed from the one extreme to the other; and being before tall, lean, and raw-boned, became on a sudden the most sturdy, robust, healthful-like fellow you have seen, with a ruddy complexion and a cheerful countenance. In excuse for my riding, and care of my health, I always said that I was afraid of consumption, which was readily believed from my looks, but now every body congratulated me upon my thorough recovery. This unnatural appetite wore off by degrees, but left me as a legacy the same palpitation of the heart in a small degree, and a good deal of wind in my stomach, which comes away easily, and without any bad gout, as is ordinary. However, these symptoms are little or no uneasiness to me. I eat well; I sleep well; have no lowness of spirits, at least never more than what one of the best health may feel from too full a meal from sitting too near a fire, and even that degree I feel very seldom, and never almost in the morning or forenoon. Those who live in the same family with me, and see me at all times, cannot observe the least alteration in my humour, and rather think me a better companion than I was before, as choosing to pass more of my time with them. This gave me such hopes, that I scarce ever missed a day's riding, except in the winter time; and last summer undertook a very laborious task, which was to travel eight miles every morning, and as many in the forenoon, to and from a mineral well of some reputation. I renewed the bitter and anti-hysteric pills twice, along with anti-scorbutic juice, last spring, but without any considerable effect, except abating the symptoms for a little time.
    <br>&emsp;Thus I have given you a full account of the condition of my body; and without staying to ask pardon, as I ought to do, for so tedious a story, shall explain to you how my mind stood all this time, which on every occasion, especially in this distemper, have a very near connexion together. Having now time and leisure to cool my inflamed imagination, I began to consider seriously how I should proceed in my philosophical inquiries, I found that the moral philosophy transmitted to us by antiquity laboured under the same inconvenience that has been found in their natural philosophy, of being entirely hypothetical, and depending more upon invention than experience: every one consulted his fancy in erecting schemes of virtue and of happiness, without regarding human nature, upon which every moral conclusion must depend. This, therefore, I resolved to make my study, and the source from which I would derive every truth in criticism as well as morality. I believe it is a certain fact, that most of the philosophers who have gone before us, have been overthrown by the greatness of their genius, and that little is required to make a man succeed in this study, than to throw off all prejudices either for his own or for those of others. At least this is all I to depend on for the truth of my reasonings, I have multiplied to such a degree, that within three years, I find I have scribbled many a quire of paper, in which there is nothing contained my own inventions. This, with the reading most the celebrated books in Latin, French, and English, acquiring the Italian, you may think a sufficient business for one in perfect health, and so it would had it been done to any purpose; but my disease was a cruel encumbrance on me.
    <br>&emsp;I found that I was not able to follow out any train of thought, by one continued stretch of view, but by repeated interruptions, and by refreshing my eye from time to time upon other objects. Yet with this inconvenience I have collected the rude materials for many volumes; but in reducing these to words, when one must bring the idea he comprehended in gross, nearer to him, so as to contemplate its minutest parts, and keep it steadily in his eye, so as to copy these parts in order ,-- this I found impracticable for me, nor were my spirits equal to so severe an employment. Here lay my greatest calamity. I had no hopes of delivering my opinions with such elegance and neatness, as to draw to me the attention of the world, and I would rather live and die in obscurity than produce them maimed and imperfect.
    <br>&emsp;Such a miserable disappointment I scarce ever remember to have heard of. The small distance betwixt me and perfect health makes me the more uneasy in my present situation. It is a weakness rather than a lowness of spirits which troubles me, and there seems to be as great a difference betwixt my distemper and common vapours, as betwixt vapours and madness. I have noticed in the writings of the French mystics, and in those of our fanatics here, that when they give a history of the situation of their souls, they mention a coldness and desertion of the spirit, which frequently returns and some of them, at the beginning, have been tormented with it many years. As this kind of devotion depends entirely on the force of passion, and consequently of the animal spirits, I have often thought that their case and mine were pretty parallel, and that their rapturous admirations might discompose the fabric of the nerves and brain, as much as profound reflections, and that warmth or enthusiasm which is inseparable from them.
    <br>&emsp;However this may be, I have not come out of the cloud so well as they commonly tell us they have done, or rather began to despair of ever recovering. To keep myself from being melancholy on so dismal a prospect, my only security was in peevish reflections on the vanity of the world and of all human glory; which, however just sentiments they may be esteemed, I have found can never be sincere, except in those who are possessed of them. Being sensible that all my philosophy would never make me contented in my present situation, I began to rouse up myself; and being encouraged by instances of recovery from worse degrees of this distemper, as well as by the assurances of my physicians, I began to think of something more effectual than I had hitherto tried. I found, that as there are two things very bad for this distemper, study and idleness, so there are two things very good, business and diversion; and that my whole time was spent betwixt the bad, with little or no share of the good. For this reason I resolved to seek out a more active life, and though I could not quit my pretensions in learning but with my last breath, to lay them aside for some time, in order the more effectually to resume them. Upon examination, I found my choice confined to two kinds of life, that of a travelling governor, and that of a merchant. The first, besides that it is in some respects an idle life, was, I found, unfit for me; and that because from a sedentary and retired way of living, from a bashful temper, and from a narrow fortune, I had been little accustomed to general companies, and had not confidence and knowledge enough of the world to push my fortune, or to be serviceable in that way. I therefore fixed my choice upon a merchant; and having got recommendation to a considerable trader in Bristol, I am just now hastening thither, with a resolution to forget myself, and every thing that is past, to engage myself, as far as is possible, in that course of life, and to toss about the world, from the one pole to the other, till I leave this behind me.
    <br>&emsp;As I am come to London in my way to Bristol, I have resolved, if possible, to get your advice, though I should take this absurd method of procuring it. All the physicians I have consulted, though very able, could never enter into my distemper; because not being persons of great learning beyond their own profession, they were unacquainted with these motions of the mind. Your fame pointed you out as the properest person to resolve my doubts, and I was determined to have somebody's opinion, which I could rest upon in all the varieties of fears and hopes, incident to so lingering a distemper. I hope I have been particular enough in describing the symptoms to allow you to form a judgment; or rather, perhaps, have been too particular. But you know it is a symptom of this distemper, to delight in complaining and talking of itself. The questions I would humbly propose to you are: Whether, among all those scholars you have been acquainted with, you have ever known any affected in this manner? Whether I can ever hope for a recovery? Whether I must long wait for it? Whether my recovery will ever be perfect, and my spirits regain their former spring and vigour, so as to endure the fatigue of deep and abstruse thinking? Whether I have taken a right way to recover? I believe all proper medicines have been used, and therefore I need mention nothing of them.

<div id="Epicurean">
    It is a great mortification to the vanity of man, that his utmost art and industry can never equal the meanest of nature's productions, either for beauty or value. Art is only the under-workman, and is employed to give a few strokes of embellishment to those pieces, which come from the hand of the master. Some of the drapery may be of his drawing; but he is not allowed to touch the principal figure. Art may make a suit of clothes: But nature must produce a man. 
    <br>&emsp;Even in those productions, commonly denominated works of art, we find that the noblest of the kind are beholden for their chief beauty to the force and happy influence of nature. To the native enthusiasm of the poets, we owe whatever is admirable in their productions. The greatest genius, where nature at any time fails him, (for she is not equal) throws aside the lyre, and hopes not, from the rules of art, to reach that divine harmony, which must proceed from her inspiration alone. How poor are those songs, where a happy flow of fancy has not furnished materials for art to embellish and refine! 
    <br>&emsp;But of all the fruitless attempts of art, no one is so ridiculous, as that which the severe philosophers have undertaken, the producing of an artificial happiness, and making us be pleased by rules of reason, and by reflection. Why did none of them claim the reward, which Xerxes promised to him, who should invent a new pleasure? Unless, perhaps, they invented so many pleasures for their own use, that they despised riches, and stood in no need of any enjoyments, which the rewards of that monarch could procure them. I am apt, indeed, to think, that they were not willing to furnish the Persian court with a new pleasure, by presenting it with so new and unusual an object of ridicule. Their speculations, when confined to theory, and gravely delivered in the schools of Greece, might excite admiration in their ignorant pupils: But the attempting to reduce such principles to practice would soon have betrayed their absurdity. 
    <br>&emsp;You pretend to make me happy by reason, and by rules of art. You must, then, create me anew by rules of art. For on my original frame and structure does my happiness depend. But you want power to effect this; and skill too, I am afraid: Nor can I entertain a less opinion of nature's wisdom than of yours. And let her conduct the machine, which she has so wisely framed. I find, that I should only spoil it by my tampering. 
    <br>&emsp;To what purpose should I pretend to regulate, refine, or invigorate any of those springs or principles, which nature has implanted in me? Is this the road by which I must reach happiness? But happiness implies ease, contentment, repose, and pleasure; not watchfulness, care, and fatigue. The health of my body consists in the facility, with which all its operations are performed. The stomach digests the aliments: The heart circulates the blood: The brain separates and refines the spirits: And all this without my concerning myself in the matter. When by my will alone I can stop the blood, as it runs with impetuosity along its canals, then may I hope to change the course of my sentiments and passions. In vain should I strain my faculties, and endeavour to receive pleasure from an object, which is not fitted by nature to affect my organs with delight. I may give myself pain by my fruitless endeavours; but shall never reach any pleasure. 
    <br>&emsp;Away then with all those vain pretences of making ourselves happy within ourselves, of feasting on our own thoughts, of being satisfied with the consciousness of well-doing, and of despising all assistance and all supplies from external objects. This is the voice of Pride, not of Nature. And it were well, if even this pride could support itself, and communicate a real inward pleasure, however melancholy or severe. But this impotent pride can do no more than regulate the outside; and with infinite pains and attention compose the language and countenance to a philosophical dignity, in order to deceive the ignorant vulgar. The heart, mean while, is empty of all enjoyment: And the mind, unsupported by its proper objects, sinks into the deepest sorrow and dejection. Miserable, but vain mortal! Thy mind be happy within itself! With what resources is it endowed to fill so immense a void, and supply the place of all thy bodily senses and faculties? Can thy head subsist without thy other members? In such a situation, 
    <br>&emsp;What foolish figure must it make? 
    <br>&emsp;Do nothing else but sleep and ake. 
    <br>&emsp;Into such a lethargy, or such a melancholy, must thy mind be plunged, when deprived of foreign occupations and enjoyments. 
    <br>&emsp;Keep me, therefore, no longer in this violent constraint. Confine me not within myself; but point out to me those objects and pleasures, which afford the chief enjoyment. But why do I apply to you, proud and ignorant sages, to shew me the road to happiness? Let me consult my own passions and inclinations. In them must I read the dictates of nature; not in your frivolous discourses. 
    <br>&emsp;But see, propitious to my wishes, the divine, the amiable pleasure, the supreme love of GODS and men, advances towards me. At her approach, my heart beats with genial heat, and every sense and every faculty is dissolved in joy; while she pours around me all the embellishments of the spring, and all the treasures of the autumn. The melody of her voice charms my ears with the softest music, as she invites me to partake of those delicious fruits, which, with a smile that diffuses a glory on the heavens and the earth, she presents to me. The sportive Cupids, who attend her, or fan me with their odoriferous wings, or pour on my head the most fragrant oils, or offer me their sparkling nectar in golden goblets. O! for ever let me spread my limbs on this bed of roses, and thus, thus feel the delicious moments, with soft and downy steps, glide along. But cruel chance! Whither do you fly so fast? Why do my ardent wishes, and that load of pleasures, under which you labour, rather hasten than retard your unrelenting pace? Suffer me to enjoy this soft repose, after all my fatigues in search of happiness. Suffer me to satiate myself with these delicacies, after the pains of so long and so foolish an abstinence. 
    <br>&emsp;But it will not do. The roses have lost their hue: The fruit its flavour: And that delicious wine, whose fumes, so late, intoxicated all my senses with such delight, now solicits in vain the sated palate. Pleasure smiles at my languor. She beckons her sister, Virtue, to come to her assistance. The gay, the frolic Virtue observes the call, and brings along the whole troop of my jovial friends. Welcome, thrice welcome, my ever dear companions, to these shady bowers, and to this luxurious repast. Your presence has restored to the rose its hue, and to the fruit its flavour. The vapours of this sprightly nectar now again play around my heart; while you partake of my delights, and discover in your chearful looks, the pleasure which you receive from my happiness and satisfaction. The like do I receive from yours; and encouraged by your joyous presence, shall again renew the feast, with which, from too much enjoyment, my senses were well nigh sated; while the mind kept not pace with the body, nor afforded relief to her o'erburthened partner. 
    <br>&emsp;In our chearful discourses, better than in the formal reasonings of the schools, is true wisdom to be found. In our friendly endearments, better than in the hollow debates of statesmen and pretended patriots, does true virtue display itself. Forgetful of the past, secure of the future, let us here enjoy the present; and while we yet possess a being, let us fix some good, beyond the power of fate or fortune. To-morrow will bring its own pleasures along with it: Or should it disappoint our fond wishes, we shall at least enjoy the pleasure of reflecting on the pleasures of to-day. 
    <br>&emsp;Fear not, my friends, that the barbarous dissonance of Bacchus, and of his revellers, should break in upon this entertainment, and confound us with their turbulent and clamorous pleasures. The sprightly muses wait around; and with their charming symphony, sufficient to soften the wolves and tygers of the savage desert, inspire a soft joy into every bosom. Peace, harmony and concord reign in this retreat; nor is the silence ever broken but by the music of our songs, or the chearful accents of our friendly voices. 
    <br>&emsp;But hark! the favourite of the muses, the gentle Damon, strikes the lyre; and while he accompanies its harmonious notes with his more harmonious song, he inspires us with the same happy debauch of fancy, by which he is himself transported. Ye happy youth, he sings, Ye favoured of heaven, while the wanton spring pours upon you all her blooming honours, let not glory seduce you, with her delusive blaze, to pass in perils and dangers this delicious season, this prime of life. Wisdom points out to you the road to pleasure: Nature too beckons you to follow her in that smooth and flowery path. Will you shut your ears to their commanding voice? Will you harden your heart to their soft allurements? Oh, deluded mortals, thus to lose your youth, thus to throw away so invaluable a present, to trifle with so perishing a blessing. Contemplate well your recompence. Consider that glory, which so allures your proud hearts, and seduces you with your own praises. It is an echo, a dream, nay the shadow of a dream, dissipated by every wind, and lost by every contrary breath of the ignorant and ill-judging multitude. You fear not that even death itself shall ravish it from you. But behold! while you are yet alive, calumny bereaves you of it; ignorance neglects it; nature enjoys it not; fancy alone, renouncing every pleasure receives this airy recompence, empty and unstable as herself. 
    <br>&emsp;Thus the hours pass unperceived along, and lead in their wanton train all the pleasures of sense, and all the joys of harmony and friendship. Smiling innocence closes the procession; and while she presents herself to our ravished eyes, she embellishes the whole scene, and renders the view of these pleasures as transporting, after they have past us, as when, with laughing countenances, they were yet advancing towards us. 
    <br>&emsp;But the sun has sunk below the horizon; and darkness, stealing silently upon us, has now buried all nature in an universal shade. Rejoice, my friends, continue your repast, or change it for soft repose. Though absent, your joy or your tranquillity shall still be mine. But whither do you go? Or what new pleasures call you from our society? Is there aught agreeable without your friends? And can aught please, in which we partake not? Yes, my friends; the joy which I now seek, admits not of your participation. Here alone I wish your absence: And here alone can I find a sufficient compensation for the loss of your society. 
    <br>&emsp;But I have not advanced far through the shades of the thick wood, which spreads a double night around me, ere, methinks, I perceive through the gloom, the charming Cælia, the mistress of my wishes, who wanders impatient through the grove, and preventing the appointed hour, silently chides my tardy steps. But the joy, which she receives from my presence, best pleads my excuse; and dissipating every anxious and every angry thought, leaves room for nought but mutual joy and rapture. With what words, my fair one, shall I express my tenderness, or describe the emotions which now warm my transported bosom! Words are too faint to describe my love; and if, alas! you feel not the same flame within you, in vain shall I endeavour to convey to you a just conception of it. But your every word and every motion suffice to remove this doubt; and while they express your passion, serve also to enflame mine. How amiable this solitude, this silence, this darkness! No objects now importune the ravished soul. The thought, the sense, all full of nothing but our mutual happiness, wholly possess the mind, and convey a pleasure, which deluded mortals vainly seek for in every other enjoyment.—— 
    <br>&emsp;But why does your bosom heave with these sighs, while tears bathe your glowing cheeks? Why distract your heart with such vain anxieties? Why so often ask me, How long my love shall yet endure? Alas, my Cælia, can I resolve this question? Do I know how long my life shall yet endure? But does this also disturb your tender breast? And is the image of our frail mortality for ever present with you, to throw a damp on your gayest hours, and poison even those joys which love inspires? Consider rather, that if life be frail, if youth be transitory, we should well employ the present moment, and lose no part of so perishable an existence. Yet a little moment and these shall be no more. We shall be, as if we had never been. Not a memory of us be left upon earth; and even the fabulous shades below will not afford us a habitation. Our fruitless anxieties, our vain projects, our uncertain speculations shall all be swallowed up and lost. Our present doubts, concerning the original cause of all things, must never, alas! be resolved. This alone we may be certain of, that, if any governing mind preside, he must be pleased to see us fulfil the ends of our being, and enjoy that pleasure, for which alone we were created. Let this reflection give ease to your anxious thoughts; but render not your joys too serious, by dwelling for ever upon it. It is sufficient, once, to be acquainted with this philosophy, in order to give an unbounded loose to love and jollity, and remove all the scruples of a vain superstition: But while youth and passion, my fair one, prompt our eager desires, we must find gayer subjects of discourse, to intermix with these amorous caresses.

<div id="theStoic">
    There is this obvious and material difference in the conduct of nature, with regard to man and other animals, that, having endowed the former with a sublime celestial spirit, and having given him an affinity with superior beings, she allows not such noble faculties to lie lethargic or idle; but urges him, by necessity, to employ, on every emergence, his utmost art and industry. Brute-creatures have many of their necessities supplied by nature, being cloathed and armed by this beneficent parent of all things: And where their own industry is requisite on any occasion, nature, by implanting instincts, still supplies them with the art, and guides them to their good, by her unerring precepts. But man, exposed naked and indigent to the rude elements, rises slowly from that helpless state, by the care and vigilance of his parents; and having attained his utmost growth and perfection, reaches only a capacity of subsisting, by his own care and vigilance. Every thing is sold to skill and labour; and where nature furnishes the materials, they are still rude and unfinished, till industry, ever active and intelligent, refines them from their brute state, and fits them for human use and convenience. 
    <br>&emsp;Acknowledge, therefore, O man, the beneficence of nature; for she has given thee that intelligence which supplies all thy necessities. But let not indolence, under the false appearance of gratitude, persuade thee to rest contented with her presents. Wouldest thou return to the raw herbage for thy food, to the open sky for thy covering, and to stones and clubs for thy defence against the ravenous animals of the desert? Then return also to thy savage manners, to thy timorous superstition, to thy brutal ignorance; and sink thyself below those animals, whose condition thou admirest, and wouldest so fondly imitate. 
    <br>&emsp;Thy kind parent, nature, having given thee art and intelligence, has filled the whole globe with materials to employ these talents: Hearken to her voice, which so plainly tells thee, that thou thyself shouldest also be the object of thy industry, and that by art and attention alone thou canst acquire that ability, which will raise thee to thy proper station in the universe. Behold this artizan, who converts a rude and shapeless stone into a noble metal; and molding that metal by his cunning hands, creates, as it were by magic, every weapon for his defence, and every utensil for his convenience. He has not this skill from nature: Use and practice have taught it him: And if thou wouldest emulate his success, thou must follow his laborious foot-steps. 
    <br>&emsp;But while thou ambitiously aspirest to perfecting thy bodily powers and faculties, wouldest thou meanly neglect thy mind, and from a preposterous sloth, leave it still rude and uncultivated, as it came from the hands of nature? Far be such folly and negligence from every rational being. If nature has been frugal in her gifts and endowments, there is the more need of art to supply her defects. If she has been generous and liberal, know that she still expects industry and application on our part, and revenges herself in proportion to our negligent ingratitude. The richest genius, like the most fertile soil, when uncultivated, shoots up into the rankest weeds; and instead of vines and olives for the pleasure and use of man, produces, to its slothful owner, the most abundant crop of poisons. 
    <br>&emsp;The great end of all human industry, is the attainment of happiness. For this were arts invented, sciences cultivated, laws ordained, and societies modelled, by the most profound wisdom of patriots and legislators. Even the lonely savage, who lies exposed to the inclemency of the elements, and the fury of wild beasts, forgets not, for a moment, this grand object of his being. Ignorant as he is of every art of life, he still keeps in view the end of all those arts, and eagerly seeks for felicity amidst that darkness with which he is environed. But as much as the wildest savage is inferior to the polished citizen, who, under the protection of laws, enjoys every convenience which industry has invented; so much is this citizen himself inferior to the man of virtue, and the true philosopher, who governs his appetites, subdues his passions, and has learned, from reason, to set a just value on every pursuit and enjoyment. For is there an art and apprenticeship necessary for every other attainment? And is there no art of life, no rule, no precepts to direct us in this principal concern? Can no particular pleasure be attained without skill; and can the whole be regulated without reflection or intelligence, by the blind guidance of appetite and instinct? Surely then no mistakes are ever committed in this affair; but every man, however dissolute and negligent, proceeds in the pursuit of happiness, with as unerring a motion, as that which the celestial bodies observe, when, conducted by the hand of the Almighty, they roll along the ethereal plains. But if mistakes be often, be inevitably committed, let us register these mistakes; let us consider their causes; let us weigh their importance; let us enquire for their remedies. When from this we have fixed all the rules of conduct, we are philosophers: When we have reduced these rules to practice, we are sages. 
    <br>&emsp;Like many subordinate artists, employed to form the several wheels and springs of a machine: Such are those who excel in all the particular arts of life. He is the master workman who puts those several parts together; moves them according to just harmony and proportion; and produces true felicity as the result of their conspiring order. 
    <br>&emsp;While thou hast such an alluring object in view, shall that labour and attention, requisite to the attainment of thy end, ever seem burdensome and intolerable? Know, that this labour itself is the chief ingredient of the felicity to which thou aspirest, and that every enjoyment soon becomes insipid and distasteful, when not acquired by fatigue and industry. See the hardy hunters rise from their downy couches, shake off the slumbers which still weigh down their heavy eye-lids, and, ere Aurora has yet covered the heavens with her flaming mantle, hasten to the forest. They leave behind, in their own houses, and in the neighbouring plains, animals of every kind, whose flesh furnishes the most delicious fare, and which offer themselves to the fatal stroke. Laborious man disdains so easy a purchase. He seeks for a prey, which hides itself from his search, or flies from his pursuit, or defends itself from his violence. Having exerted in the chace every passion of the mind, and every member of the body, he then finds the charms of repose, and with joy compares its pleasures to those of his engaging labours. 
    <br>&emsp;And can vigorous industry give pleasure to the pursuit even of the most worthless prey, which frequently escapes our toils? And cannot the same industry render the cultivating of our mind, the moderating of our passions, the enlightening of our reason, an agreeable occupation; while we are every day sensible of our progress, and behold our inward features and countenance brightening incessantly with new charms? Begin by curing yourself of this lethargic indolence; the task is not difficult: You need but taste the sweets of honest labour. Proceed to learn the just value of every pursuit; long study is not requisite: Compare, though but for once, the mind to the body, virtue to fortune, and glory to pleasure. You will then perceive the advantages of industry: You will then be sensible what are the proper objects of your industry. 
    <br>&emsp;In vain do you seek repose from beds of roses: In vain do you hope for enjoyment from the most delicious wines and fruits. Your indolence itself becomes a fatigue: Your pleasure itself creates disgust. The mind, unexercised, finds every delight insipid and loathsome; and ere yet the body, full of noxious humours, feels the torment of its multiplied diseases, your nobler part is sensible of the invading poison, and seeks in vain to relieve its anxiety by new pleasures, which still augment the fatal malady. 
    <br>&emsp;I need not tell you, that, by this eager pursuit of pleasure, you more and more expose yourself to fortune and accidents, and rivet your affections on external objects, which chance may, in a moment, ravish from you. I shall suppose, that your indulgent stars favour you still with the enjoyment of your riches and possessions. I prove to you, that even in the midst of your luxurious pleasures, you are unhappy; and that by too much indulgence, you are incapable of enjoying what prosperous fortune still allows you to possess. 
    <br>&emsp;But surely the instability of fortune is a consideration not to be overlooked or neglected. Happiness cannot possibly exist, where there is no security; and security can have no place, where fortune has any dominion. Though that unstable deity should not exert her rage against you, the dread of it would still torment you; would disturb your slumbers, haunt your dreams, and throw a damp on the jollity of your most delicious banquets. 
    <br>&emsp;The temple of wisdom is seated on a rock, above the rage of the fighting elements, and inaccessible to all the malice of man. The rolling thunder breaks below; and those more terrible instruments of human fury reach not to so sublime a height. The sage, while he breathes that serene air, looks down with pleasure, mixed with compassion, on the errors of mistaken mortals, who blindly seek for the true path of life, and pursue riches, nobility, honour, or power, for genuine felicity. The greater part he beholds disappointed of their fond wishes: Some lament, that having once possessed the object of their desires, it is ravished from them by envious fortune: And all complain, that even their own vows, though granted, cannot give them happiness, or relieve the anxiety of their distracted minds. 
    <br>&emsp;But does the sage always preserve himself in this philosophical indifference, and rest contented with lamenting the miseries of mankind, without ever employing himself for their relief? Does he constantly indulge this severe wisdom, which, by pretending to elevate him above human accidents, does in reality harden his heart, and render him careless of the interests of mankind, and of society? No; he knows that in this sullen Apathy, neither true wisdom nor true happiness can be found. He feels too strongly the charm of the social affections ever to counteract so sweet, so natural, so virtuous a propensity. Even when, bathed in tears, he laments the miseries of human race, of his country, of his friends, and unable to give succour, can only relieve them by compassion; he yet rejoices in the generous disposition, and feels a satisfaction superior to that of the most indulged sense. So engaging are the sentiments of humanity, that they brighten up the very face of sorrow, and operate like the sun, which, shining on a dusky cloud or falling rain, paints on them the most glorious colours which are to be found in the whole circle of nature. 
    <br>&emsp;But it is not here alone, that the social virtues display their energy. With whatever ingredient you mix them, they are still predominant. As sorrow cannot overcome them, so neither can sensual pleasure obscure them. The joys of love, however tumultuous, banish not the tender sentiments of sympathy and affection. They even derive their chief influence from that generous passion; and when presented alone, afford nothing to the unhappy mind but lassitude and disgust. Behold this sprightly debauchee, who professes a contempt of all other pleasures but those of wine and jollity: Separate him from his companions, like a spark from a fire, where before it contributed to the general blaze: His alacrity suddenly extinguishes; and though surrounded with every other means of delight, he lothes the sumptuous banquet, and prefers even the most abstracted study and speculation, as more agreeable and entertaining. 
    <br>&emsp;But the social passions never afford such transporting pleasures, or make so glorious an appearance in the eyes both of GOD and man, as when, shaking off every earthly mixture, they associate themselves with the sentiments of virtue, and prompt us to laudable and worthy actions. As harmonious colours mutually give and receive a lustre by their friendly union; so do these ennobling sentiments of the human mind. See the triumph of nature in parental affection! What selfish passion; what sensual delight is a match for it! Whether a man exults in the prosperity and virtue of his offspring, or flies to their succour, through the most threatening and tremendous dangers? 
    <br>&emsp;Proceed still in purifying the generous passion, you will still the more admire its shining glories. What charms are there in the harmony of minds, and in a friendship founded on mutual esteem and gratitude! What satisfaction in relieving the distressed, in comforting the afflicted, in raising the fallen, and in stopping the career of cruel fortune, or of more cruel man, in their insults over the good and virtuous! But what supreme joy in the victories over vice as well as misery, when, by virtuous example or wise exhortation, our fellow-creatures are taught to govern their passions, reform their vices, and subdue their worst enemies, which inhabit within their own bosoms? 
    <br>&emsp;But these objects are still too limited for the human mind, which, being of celestial origin, swells with the divinest and most enlarged affections, and carrying its attention beyond kindred and acquaintance, extends its benevolent wishes to the most distant posterity. It views liberty and laws as the source of human happiness, and devotes itself, with the utmost alacrity, to their guardianship and protection. Toils, dangers, death itself carry their charms, when we brave them for the public good, and ennoble that being, which we generously sacrifice for the interests of our country. Happy the man, whom indulgent fortune allows to pay to virtue what he owes to nature, and to make a generous gift of what must otherwise be ravished from him by cruel necessity! 
    <br>&emsp;In the true sage and patriot are united whatever can distinguish human nature, or elevate mortal man to a resemblance with the divinity. The softest benevolence, the most undaunted resolution, the tenderest sentiments, the most sublime love of virtue, all these animate successively his transported bosom. What satisfaction, when he looks within, to find the most turbulent passions tuned to just harmony and concord, and every jarring sound banished from this enchanting music! If the contemplation, even of inanimate beauty, is so delightful; if it ravishes the senses, even when the fair form is foreign to us: What must be the effects of moral beauty? And what influence must it have, when it embellishes our own mind, and is the result of our own reflection and industry? 
    <br>&emsp;But where is the reward of virtue? And what recompence has nature provided for such important sacrifices, as those of life and fortune, which we must often make to it? Oh, sons of earth! Are ye ignorant of the value of this celestial mistress? And do ye meanly enquire for her portion, when ye observe her genuine charms? But know, that nature has been indulgent to human weakness, and has not left this favourite child, naked and unendowed. She has provided virtue with the richest dowry; but being careful, lest the allurements of interest should engage such suitors, as were insensible of the native worth of so divine a beauty, she has wisely provided, that this dowry can have no charms but in the eyes of those who are already transported with the love of virtue. Glory is the portion of virtue, the sweet reward of honourable toils, the triumphant crown, which covers the thoughtful head of the disinterested patriot, or the dusty brow of the victorious warrior. Elevated by so sublime a prize, the man of virtue looks down with contempt on all the allurements of pleasure, and all the menaces of danger. Death itself loses its terrors, when he considers, that its dominion extends only over a part of him, and that, in spite of death and time, the rage of the elements, and the endless vicissitude of human affairs, he is assured of an immortal fame among all the sons of men. 
    <br>&emsp;There surely is a being who presides over the universe; and who, with infinite wisdom and power, has reduced the jarring elements into just order and proportion. Let speculative reasoners dispute, how far this beneficent being extends his care, and whether he prolongs our existence beyond the grave, in order to bestow on virtue its just reward, and render it fully triumphant. The man of morals, without deciding any thing on so dubious a subject, is satisfied with the portion, marked out to him by the supreme disposer of all things. Gratefully he accepts of that farther reward prepared for him; but if disappointed, he thinks not virtue an empty name; but justly esteeming it its own reward, he gratefully acknowledges the bounty of his creator, who, by calling him into existence, has thereby afforded him an opportunity of once acquiring so invaluable a possession.

<div id="Platonist"> 
    To some philosophers it appears matter of surprize, that all mankind, possessing the same nature, and being endowed with the same faculties, should yet differ so widely in their pursuits and inclinations, and that one should utterly condemn what is fondly sought after by another. To some it appears matter of still more surprize, that a man should differ so widely from himself at different times; and, after possession, reject with disdain what, before, was the object of all his vows and wishes. To me this feverish uncertainty and irresolution, in human conduct, seems altogether unavoidable; nor can a rational soul, made for the contemplation of the Supreme Being, and of his works, ever enjoy tranquillity or satisfaction, while detained in the ignoble pursuits of sensual pleasure or popular applause. The divinity is a boundless ocean of bliss and glory: Human minds are smaller streams, which, arising at first from this ocean, seek still, amid all their wanderings, to return to it, and to lose themselves in that immensity of perfection. When checked in this natural course, by vice or folly, they become furious and enraged; and, swelling to a torrent, do then spread horror and devastation on the neighbouring plains. 
    <br>&emsp;In vain, by pompous phrase and passionate expression, each recommends his own pursuit, and invites the credulous hearers to an imitation of his life and manners. The heart belies the countenance, and sensibly feels, even amid the highest success, the unsatisfactory nature of all those pleasures, which detain it from its true object. I examine the voluptuous man before enjoyment; I measure the vehemence of his desire, and the importance of his object; I find that all his happiness proceeds only from that hurry of thought, which takes him from himself, and turns his view from his guilt and misery. I consider him a moment after; he has now enjoyed the pleasure, which he fondly sought after. The sense of his guilt and misery returns upon him with double anguish: His mind tormented with fear and remorse; his body depressed with disgust and satiety. 
    <br>&emsp;But a more august, at least a more haughty personage, presents himself boldly to our censure; and assuming the title of a philosopher and man of morals, offers to submit to the most rigid examination. He challenges, with a visible, though concealed impatience, our approbation and applause; and seems offended, that we should hesitate a moment before we break out into admiration of his virtue. Seeing this impatience, I hesitate still more: I begin to examine the motives of his seeming virtue: But behold! ere I can enter upon this enquiry, he flings himself from me; and addressing his discourse to that crowd of heedless auditors, fondly abuses them by his magnificent pretensions. 
    <br>&emsp;O philosopher! thy wisdom is vain, and thy virtue unprofitable. Thou seekest the ignorant applauses of men, not the solid reflections of thy own conscience, or the more solid approbation of that being, who, with one regard of his all-seeing eye, penetrates the universe. Thou surely art conscious of the hollowness of thy pretended probity, whilst calling thyself a citizen, a son, a friend, thou forgettest thy higher sovereign, thy true father, thy greatest benefactor. Where is the adoration due to infinite perfection, whence every thing good and valuable is derived? Where is the gratitude, owing to thy creator, who called thee forth from nothing, who placed thee in all these relations to thy fellow-creatures, and requiring thee to fulfil the duty of each relation, forbids thee to neglect what thou owest to himself, the most perfect being, to whom thou art connected by the closest tye? 
    <br>&emsp;But thou art thyself thy own idol: Thou worshippest thy imaginary perfections: Or rather, sensible of thy real imperfections, thou seekest only to deceive the world, and to please thy fancy, by multiplying thy ignorant admirers. Thus, not content with neglecting what is most excellent in the universe, thou desirest to substitute in his place what is most vile and contemptible. 
    <br>&emsp;Consider all the works of mens hands; all the inventions of human wit, in which thou affectest so nice a discernment: Thou wilt find, that the most perfect production still proceeds from the most perfect thought, and that it is mind alone, which we admire, while we bestow our applause on the graces of a well-proportioned statue, or the symmetry of a noble pile. The statuary, the architect comes still in view, and makes us reflect on the beauty of his art and contrivance, which, from a heap of unformed matter, could extract such expressions and proportions. This superior beauty of thought and intelligence thou thyself acknowledgest, while thou invitest us to contemplate, in thy conduct, the harmony of affections, the dignity of sentiments, and all those graces of a mind, which chiefly merit our attention. But why stoppest thou short? Seest thou nothing farther that is valuable? Amid thy rapturous applauses of beauty and order, art thou still ignorant where is to be found the most consummate beauty? the most perfect order? Compare the works of art with those of nature. The one are but imitations of the other. The nearer art approaches to nature, the more perfect is it esteemed. But still, how wide are its nearest approaches, and what an immense interval may be observed between them? Art copies only the outside of nature, leaving the inward and more admirable springs and principles; as exceeding her imitation; as beyond her comprehension. Art copies only the minute productions of nature, despairing to reach that grandeur and magnificence, which are so astonishing in the masterly works of her original. Can we then be so blind as not to discover an intelligence and a design in the exquisite and most stupendous contrivance of the universe? Can we be so stupid as not to feel the warmest raptures of worship and adoration, upon the contemplation of that intelligent being, so infinitely good and wise? 
    <br>&emsp;The most perfect happiness, surely, must arise from the contemplation of the most perfect object. But what more perfect than beauty and virtue? And where is beauty to be found equal to that of the universe? Or virtue, which can be compared to the benevolence and justice of the Deity? If aught can diminish the pleasure of this contemplation, it must be either the narrowness of our faculties, which conceals from us the greatest part of these beauties and perfections; or the shortness of our lives, which allows not time sufficient to instruct us in them. But it is our comfort, that, if we employ worthily the faculties here assigned us, they will be enlarged in another state of existence, so as to render us more suitable worshippers of our maker: And that the task, which can never be finished in time, will be the business of an eternity.

<div id="TheSceptic"> 
    I have long entertained a suspicion, with regard to the decisions of philosophers upon all subjects, and found in myself a greater inclination to dispute, than assent to their conclusions. There is one mistake, to which they seem liable, almost without exception; they confine too much their principles, and make no account of that vast variety, which nature has so much affected in all her operations. When a philosopher has once laid hold of a favourite principle, which perhaps accounts for many natural effects, he extends the same principle over the whole creation, and reduces to it every phænomenon, though by the most violent and absurd reasoning. Our own mind being narrow and contracted, we cannot extend our conception to the variety and extent of nature; but imagine, that she is as much bounded in her operations, as we are in our speculation. 
    <br>&emsp;But if ever this infirmity of philosophers is to be suspected on any occasion, it is in their reasonings concerning human life, and the methods of attaining happiness. In that case, they are led astray, not only by the narrowness of their understandings, but by that also of their passions. Almost every one has a predominant inclination, to which his other desires and affections submit, and which governs him, though, perhaps, with some intervals, through the whole course of his life. It is difficult for him to apprehend, that any thing, which appears totally indifferent to him, can ever give enjoyment to any person, or can possess charms, which altogether escape his observation. His own pursuits are always, in his account, the most engaging: The objects of his passion, the most valuable: And the road, which he pursues, the only one that leads to happiness. 
    <br>&emsp;But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? What is the meaning therefore of those general preferences of the town or country life, of a life of action or one of pleasure, of retirement or society; when besides the different inclinations of different men, every one's experience may convince him, that each of these kinds of life is agreeable in its turn, and that their variety or their judicious mixture chiefly contributes to the rendering all of them agreeable. 
    <br>&emsp;But shall this business be allowed to go altogether at adventures? And must a man consult only his humour and inclination, in order to determine his course of life, without employing his reason to inform him what road is preferable, and leads most surely to happiness? Is there no difference then between one man's conduct and another? 
    <br>&emsp;I answer, there is a great difference. One man, following his inclination, in chusing his course of life, may employ much surer means for succeeding than another, who is led by his inclination into the same course of life, and pursues the same object. Are riches the chief object of your desires? Acquire skill in your profession; be diligent in the exercise of it; enlarge the circle of your friends and acquaintance; avoid pleasure and expence; and never be generous, but with a view of gaining more than you could save by frugality. Would you acquire the public esteem? Guard equally against the extremes of arrogance and fawning. Let it appear that you set a value upon yourself, but without despising others. If you fall into either of the extremes, you either provoke men's pride by your insolence, or teach them to despise you by your timorous submission, and by the mean opinion which you seem to entertain of yourself. 
    <br>&emsp;These, you say, are the maxims of common prudence, and discretion; what every parent inculcates on his child, and what every man of sense pursues in the course of life, which he has chosen.—What is it then you desire more? Do you come to a philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion?———Yes; we come to a philosopher to be instructed, how we shall chuse our ends, more than the means for attaining these ends: We want to know what desire we shall gratify, what passion we shall comply with, what appetite we shall indulge. As to the rest, we trust to common sense, and the general maxims of the world for our instruction. 
    <br>&emsp;I am sorry then, I have pretended to be a philosopher: For I find your questions very perplexing; and am in danger, if my answer be too rigid and severe, of passing for a pedant and scholastic; if it be too easy and free, of being taken for a preacher of vice and immorality. However, to satisfy you, I shall deliver my opinion upon the matter, and shall only desire you to esteem it of as little consequence as I do myself. By that means you will neither think it worthy of your ridicule nor your anger. 
    <br>&emsp;If we can depend upon any principle, which we learn from philosophy, this, I think, may be considered as certain and undoubted, that there is nothing, in itself, valuable or despicable, desirable or hateful, beautiful or deformed; but that these attributes arise from the particular constitution and fabric of human sentiment and affection. What seems the most delicious food to one animal, appears loathsome to another: What affects the feeling of one with delight, produces uneasiness in another. This is confessedly the case with regard to all the bodily senses: But if we examine the matter more accurately, we shall find, that the same observation holds even where the mind concurs with the body, and mingles its sentiment with the exterior appetite. 
    <br>&emsp;Desire this passionate lover to give you a character of his mistress: He will tell you, that he is at a loss for words to describe her charms, and will ask you very seriously if ever you were acquainted with a goddess or an angel? If you answer that you never were: He will then say, that it is impossible for you to form a conception of such divine beauties as those which his charmer possesses; so complete a shape; such well-proportioned features; so engaging an air; such sweetness of disposition; such gaiety of humour. You can infer nothing, however, from all this discourse, but that the poor man is in love; and that the general appetite between the sexes, which nature has infused into all animals, is in him determined to a particular object by some qualities, which give him pleasure. The same divine creature, not only to a different animal, but also to a different man, appears a mere mortal being, and is beheld with the utmost indifference. 
    <br>&emsp;Nature has given all animals a like prejudice in favour of their offspring. As soon as the helpless infant sees the light, though in every other eye it appears a despicable and a miserable creature, it is regarded by its fond parent with the utmost affection, and is preferred to every other object, however perfect and accomplished. The passion alone, arising from the original structure and formation of human nature, bestows a value on the most insignificant object. 
    <br>&emsp;We may push the same observation further, and may conclude, that, even when the mind operates alone, and feeling the sentiment of blame or approbation, pronounces one object deformed and odious, another beautiful and amiable; I say, that, even in this case, those qualities are not really in the objects, but belong entirely to the sentiment of that mind which blames or praises. I grant, that it will be more difficult to make this proposition evident, and as it were, palpable, to negligent thinkers; because nature is more uniform in the sentiments of the mind than in most feelings of the body, and produces a nearer resemblance in the inward than in the outward part of human kind. There is something approaching to principles in mental taste; and critics can reason and dispute more plausibly than cooks or perfumers. We may observe, however, that this uniformity among human kind, hinders not, but that there is a considerable diversity in the sentiments of beauty and worth, and that education, custom, prejudice, caprice, and humour, frequently vary our taste of this kind. You will never convince a man, who is not accustomed to Italian music, and has not an ear to follow its intricacies, that a Scotch tune is not preferable. You have not even any single argument, beyond your own taste, which you can employ in your behalf: And to your antagonist, his particular taste will always appear a more convincing argument to the contrary. If you be wise, each of you will allow, that the other may be in the right; and having many other instances of this diversity of taste, you will both confess, that beauty and worth are merely of a relative nature, and consist in an agreeable sentiment, produced by an object in a particular mind, according to the peculiar structure and constitution of that mind. 
    <br>&emsp;By this diversity of sentiment, observable in human kind, nature has, perhaps, intended to make us sensible of her authority, and let us see what surprizing changes she could produce on the passions and desires of mankind, merely by the change of their inward fabric, without any alteration on the objects. The vulgar may even be convinced by this argument: But men, accustomed to thinking, may draw a more convincing, at least a more general argument, from the very nature of the subject. 
    <br>&emsp;In the operation of reasoning, the mind does nothing but run over its objects, as they are supposed to stand in reality, without adding any thing to them, or diminishing any thing from them. If I examine the Ptolomaic and Copernican systems, I endeavour only, by my enquiries, to know the real situation of the planets; that is in other words, I endeavour to give them, in my conception, the same relations, that they bear towards each other in the heavens. To this operation of the mind, therefore, there seems to be always a real, though often an unknown standard, in the nature of things; nor is truth or falsehood variable by the various apprehensions of mankind. Though all human race should for ever conclude, that the sun moves, and the earth remains at rest, the sun stirs not an inch from his place for all these reasonings; and such conclusions are eternally false and erroneous. 
    <br>&emsp;But the case is not the same with the qualities of beautiful and deformed, desirable and odious, as with truth and falsehood. In the former case, the mind is not content with merely surveying its objects, as they stand in themselves: It also feels a sentiment of delight or uneasiness, approbation or blame, consequent to that survey; and this sentiment determines it to affix the epithet beautiful or deformed, desirable or odious. Now, it is evident, that this sentiment must depend upon the particular fabric or structure of the mind, which enables such particular forms to operate in such a particular manner, and produces a sympathy or conformity between the mind and its objects. Vary the structure of the mind or inward organs, the sentiment no longer follows, though the form remains the same. The sentiment being different from the object, and arising from its operation upon the organs of the mind, an alteration upon the latter must vary the effect, nor can the same object, presented to a mind totally different, produce the same sentiment. 
    <br>&emsp;This conclusion every one is apt to draw of himself, without much philosophy, where the sentiment is evidently distinguishable from the object. Who is not sensible, that power, and glory, and vengeance, are not desirable of themselves, but derive all their value from the structure of human passions, which begets a desire towards such particular pursuits? But with regard to beauty, either natural or moral, the case is commonly supposed to be different. The agreeable quality is thought to lie in the object, not in the sentiment; and that merely because the sentiment is not so turbulent and violent as to distinguish itself, in an evident manner, from the perception of the object. 
    <br>&emsp;But a little reflection suffices to distinguish them. A man may know exactly all the circles and ellipses of the Copernican system, and all the irregular spirals of the Ptolomaic, without perceiving that the former is more beautiful than the latter. Euclid has fully explained every quality of the circle, but has not, in any proposition, said a word of its beauty. The reason is evident. Beauty is not a quality of the circle. It lies not in any part of the line whose parts are all equally distant from a common center. It is only the effect, which that figure produces upon a mind, whose particular fabric or structure renders it susceptible of such sentiments. In vain would you look for it in the circle, or seek it, either by your senses, or by mathematical reasonings, in all the properties of that figure. 
    <br>&emsp;The mathematician, who took no other pleasure in reading Virgil, but that of examining Eneas's voyage by the map, might perfectly understand the meaning of every Latin word, employed by that divine author; and consequently, might have a distinct idea of the whole narration. He would even have a more distinct idea of it, than they could attain who had not studied so exactly the geography of the poem. He knew, therefore, every thing in the poem: But he was ignorant of its beauty; because the beauty, properly speaking, lies not in the poem, but in the sentiment or taste of the reader. And where a man has no such delicacy of temper, as to make him feel this sentiment, he must be ignorant of the beauty, though possessed of the science and understanding of an angel. 
    <br>&emsp;The inference upon the whole is, that it is not from the value or worth of the object, which any person pursues, that we can determine his enjoyment, but merely from the passion with which he pursues it, and the success which he meets with in his pursuit. Objects have absolutely no worth or value in themselves. They derive their worth merely from the passion. If that be strong, and steady, and successful, the person is happy. It cannot reasonably be doubted, but a little miss, dressed in a new gown for a dancing-school ball, receives as compleat enjoyment as the greatest orator, who triumphs in the spendor of his eloquence, while he governs the passions and resolutions of a numerous assembly. 
    <br>&emsp;All the difference, therefore, between one man and another, with regard to life, consists either in the passion, or in the enjoyment: And these differences are sufficient to produce the wide extremes of happiness and misery. 
    <br>&emsp;To be happy, the passion must neither be too violent nor too remiss. In the first case, the mind is in a perpetual hurry and tumult; in the second, it sinks into a disagreeable indolence and lethargy. 
    <br>&emsp;To be happy, the passion must be benign and social; not rough or fierce. The affections of the latter kind are not near so agreeable to the feeling, as those of the former. Who will compare rancour and animosity, envy and revenge, to friendship, benignity, clemency, and gratitude? 
    <br>&emsp;To be happy, the passion must be chearful and gay, not gloomy and melancholy. A propensity to hope and joy is real riches: One to fear and sorrow, real poverty. 
    <br>&emsp;Some passions or inclinations, in the enjoyment of their object, are not so steady or constant as others, nor convey such durable pleasure and satisfaction. Philosophical devotion, for instance, like the enthusiasm of a poet, is the transitory effect of high spirits, great leisure, a fine genius, and a habit of study and contemplation: But notwithstanding all these circumstances, an abstract, invisible object, like that which natural religion alone presents to us, cannot long actuate the mind, or be of any moment in life. To render the passion of continuance, we must find some method of affecting the senses and imagination, and must embrace some historical, as well as philosophical account of the divinity. Popular superstitions and observances are even found to be of use in this particular. 
    <br>&emsp;Though the tempers of men be very different, yet we may safely pronounce in general, that a life of pleasure cannot support itself so long as one of business, but is much more subject to satiety and disgust. The amusements, which are the most durable, have all a mixture of application and attention in them; such as gaming and hunting. And in general, business and action fill up all the great vacancies in human life. 
    <br>&emsp;But where the temper is the best disposed for any enjoyment, the object is often wanting: And in this respect, the passions, which pursue external objects, contribute not so much to happiness, as those which rest in ourselves; since we are neither so certain of attaining such objects, nor so secure in possessing them. A passion for learning is preferable, with regard to happiness, to one for riches. 
    <br>&emsp;Some men are possessed of great strength of mind; and even when they pursue external objects, are not much affected by a disappointment, but renew their application and industry with the greatest chearfulness. Nothing contributes more to happiness than such a turn of mind. 
    <br>&emsp;According to this short and imperfect sketch of human life, the happiest disposition of mind is the virtuous; or, in other words, that which leads to action and employment, renders us sensible to the social passions, steels the heart against the assaults of fortune, reduces the affections to a just moderation, makes our own thoughts an entertainment to us, and inclines us rather to the pleasures of society and conversation, than to those of the senses. This, in the mean time, must be obvious to the most careless reasoner, that all dispositions of mind are not alike favourable to happiness, and that one passion or humour may be extremely desirable, while another is equally disagreeable. And indeed, all the difference between the conditions of life depends upon the mind; nor is there any one situation of affairs, in itself, preferable to another. Good and ill, both natural and moral, are entirely relative to human sentiment and affection. No man would ever be unhappy, could he alter his feelings. Proteus-like, he would elude all attacks, by the continual alterations of his shape and form. 
    <br>&emsp;But of this resource nature has, in a great measure, deprived us. The fabric and constitution of our mind no more depends on our choice, than that of our body. The generality of men have not even the smallest notion, that any alteration in this respect can ever be desirable. As a stream necessarily follows the several inclinations of the ground, on which it runs; so are the ignorant and thoughtless part of mankind actuated by their natural propensities. Such are effectually excluded from all pretensions to philosophy, and the medicine of the mind, so much boasted. But even upon the wise and thoughtful, nature has a prodigious influence; nor is it always in a man's power, by the utmost art and industry, to correct his temper, and attain that virtuous character, to which he aspires. The empire of philosophy extends over a few; and with regard to these too, her authority is very weak and limited. Men may well be sensible of the value of virtue, and may desire to attain it; but it is not always certain, that they will be successful in their wishes. 
    <br>&emsp;Whoever considers, without prejudice, the course of human actions, will find, that mankind are almost entirely guided by constitution and temper, and that general maxims have little influence, but so far as they affect our taste or sentiment. If a man have a lively sense of honour and virtue, with moderate passions, his conduct will always be conformable to the rules of morality; or if he depart from them, his return will be easy and expeditious. On the other hand, where one is born of so perverse a frame of mind, of so callous and insensible a disposition, as to have no relish for virtue and humanity, no sympathy with his fellow-creatures, no desire of esteem and applause; such a one must be allowed entirely incurable, nor is there any remedy in philosophy. He reaps no satisfaction but from low and sensual objects, or from the indulgence of malignant passions: He feels no remorse to controul his vicious inclinations: He has not even that sense or taste, which is requisite to make him desire a better character: For my part, I know not how I should address myself to such a one, or by what arguments I should endeavour to reform him. Should I tell him of the inward satisfaction which results from laudable and humane actions, the delicate pleasure of disinterested love and friendship, the lasting enjoyments of a good name and an established character, he might still reply, that these were, perhaps, pleasures to such as were susceptible of them; but that, for his part, he finds himself of a quite different turn and disposition. I must repeat it; my philosophy affords no remedy in such a case, nor could I do any thing but lament this person's unhappy condition. But then I ask, If any other philosophy can afford a remedy; or if it be possible, by any system, to render all mankind virtuous, however perverse may be their natural frame of mind? Experience will soon convince us of the contrary; and I will venture to affirm, that, perhaps, the chief benefit, which results from philosophy, arises in an indirect manner, and proceeds more from its secret, insensible influence, than from its immediate application. 
    <br>&emsp;It is certain, that a serious attention to the sciences and liberal arts softens and humanizes the temper, and cherishes those fine emotions, in which true virtue and honour consists. It rarely, very rarely happens, that a man of taste and learning is not, at least, an honest man, whatever frailties may attend him. The bent of his mind to speculative studies must mortify in him the passions of interest and ambition, and must, at the same time, give him a greater sensibility of all the decencies and duties of life. He feels more fully a moral distinction in characters and manners; nor is his sense of this kind diminished, but, on the contrary, it is much encreased, by speculation. 
    <br>&emsp;Besides such insensible changes upon the temper and disposition, it is highly probable, that others may be produced by study and application. The prodigious effects of education may convince us, that the mind is not altogether stubborn and inflexible, but will admit of many alterations from its original make and structure. Let a man propose to himself the model of a character, which he approves: Let him be well acquainted with those particulars, in which his own character deviates from this model: Let him keep a constant watch over himself, and bend his mind, by a continual effort, from the vices, towards the virtues; and I doubt not but, in time, he will find, in his temper, an alteration for the better. 
    <br>&emsp;Habit is another powerful means of reforming the mind, and implanting in it good dispositions and inclinations. A man, who continues in a course of sobriety and temperance, will hate riot and disorder: If he engage in business or study, indolence will seem a punishment to him: If he constrain himself to practise beneficence and affability, he will soon abhor all instances of pride and violence. Where one is thoroughly convinced that the virtuous course of life is preferable; if he have but resolution enough, for some time, to impose a violence on himself; his reformation needs not be despaired of. The misfortune is, that this conviction and this resolution never can have place, unless a man be, before-hand, tolerably virtuous. 
    <br>&emsp;Here then is the chief triumph of art and philosophy: It insensibly refines the temper, and it points out to us those dispositions which we should endeavour to attain, by a constant bent of mind, and by repeated habit. Beyond this I cannot acknowledge it to have great influence; and I must entertain doubts concerning all those exhortations and consolations, which are in such vogue among speculative reasoners. 
    <br>&emsp;We have already observed, that no objects are, in themselves, desirable or odious, valuable or despicable; but that objects acquire these qualities from the particular character and constitution of the mind, which surveys them. To diminish therefore, or augment any person's value for an object, to excite or moderate his passions, there are no direct arguments or reasons, which can be employed with any force or influence. The catching of flies, like Domitian, if it give more pleasure, is preferable to the hunting of wild beasts, like William Rufus, or conquering of kingdoms, like Alexander. 
    <br>&emsp;But though the value of every object can be determined only by the sentiment or passion of every individual, we may observe, that the passion, in pronouncing its verdict, considers not the object simply, as it is in itself, but surveys it with all the circumstances, which attend it. A man transported with joy, on account of his possessing a diamond, confines not his view to the glistering stone before him: He also considers its rarity, and thence chiefly arises his pleasure and exultation. Here therefore a philosopher may step in, and suggest particular views, and considerations, and circumstances, which otherwise would have escaped us; and, by that means, he may either moderate or excite any particular passion. 
    <br>&emsp;It may seem unreasonable absolutely to deny the authority of philosophy in this respect: But it must be confessed, that there lies this strong presumption against it, that, if these views be natural and obvious, they would have occurred of themselves, without the assistance of philosophy; if they be not natural, they never can have any influence on the affections. These are of a very delicate nature, and cannot be forced or constrained by the utmost art or industry. A consideration, which we seek for on purpose, which we enter into with difficulty, which we cannot retain without care and attention, will never produce those genuine and durable movements of passion, which are the result of nature, and the constitution of the mind. A man may as well pretend to cure himself of love, by viewing his mistress through the artificial medium of a microscope or prospect, and beholding there the coarseness of her skin, and monstrous disproportion of her features, as hope to excite or moderate any passion by the artificial arguments of a Seneca or an Epictetus. The remembrance of the natural aspect and situation of the object, will, in both cases, still recur upon him. The reflections of philosophy are too subtile and distant to take place in common life, or eradicate any affection. The air is too fine to breathe in, where it is above the winds and clouds of the atmosphere. 
    <br>&emsp;Another defect of those refined reflections, which philosophy suggests to us, is, that commonly they cannot diminish or extinguish our vicious passions, without diminishing or extinguishing such as are virtuous, and rendering the mind totally indifferent and unactive. They are, for the most part, general, and are applicable to all our affections. In vain do we hope to direct their influence only to one side. If by incessant study and meditation we have rendered them intimate and present to us, they will operate throughout, and spread an universal insensibility over the mind. When we destroy the nerves, we extinguish the sense of pleasure, together with that of pain, in the human body. 
    <br>&emsp;It will be easy, by one glance of the eye, to find one or other of these defects in most of those philosophical reflections, so much celebrated both in ancient and modern times. Let not the injuries or violence of men, say the philosophers, ever discompose you by anger or hatred. Would you be angry at the ape for its malice, or the tyger for its ferocity? This reflection leads us into a bad opinion of human nature, and must extinguish the social affections. It tends also to prevent all remorse for a man's own crimes; when he considers, that vice is as natural to mankind, as the particular instincts to brute-creatures. 
    <br>&emsp;All ills arise from the order of the universe, which is absolutely perfect. Would you wish to disturb so divine an order for the sake of your own particular interest? What if the ills I suffer arise from malice or oppression? But the vices and imperfections of men are also comprehended in the order of the universe: 
    <br>&emsp;If plagues and earthquakes break not heav'n's design, 
    <br>&emsp;Why then a Borgia or a Catiline? 
    <br>&emsp;Let this be allowed; and my own vices will also be a part of the same order. 
    <br>&emsp;To one who said, that none were happy, who were not above opinion, a Spartan replied, then none are happy but knaves and robbers. 
    <br>&emsp;Man is born to be miserable; and is he surprized at any particular misfortune? And can he give way to sorrow and lamentation upon account of any disaster? Yes: He very reasonably laments, that he should be born to be miserable. Your consolation presents a hundred ills for one, of which you pretend to ease him. 
    <br>&emsp;You should always have before your eyes death, disease, poverty, blindness, exile, calumny, and infamy, as ills which are incident to human nature. If any one of these ills falls to your lot, you will bear it the better, when you have reckoned upon it. I answer, if we confine ourselves to a general and distant reflection on the ills of human life, that can have no effect to prepare us for them. If by close and intense meditation we render them present and intimate to us, that is the true secret for poisoning all our pleasures, and rendering us perpetually miserable. 
    <br>&emsp;Your sorrow is fruitless, and will not change the course of destiny. Very true: And for that very reason I am sorry. 
    <br>&emsp;Cicero's consolation for deafness is somewhat curious. How many languages are there, says he, which you do not understand? The Punic, Spanish, Gallic, Ægyptian, &c. With regard to all these, you are as if you were deaf, yet you are indifferent about the matter. Is it then so great a misfortune to be deaf to one language more? 
    <br>&emsp;I like better the repartee of Antipater the Cyreniac, when some women were condoling with him for his blindness: What! says he, Do you think there are no pleasures in the dark? 
    <br>&emsp;Nothing can be more destructive, says Fontenelle, to ambition, and the passion for conquest, than the true system of astronomy. What a poor thing is even the whole globe in comparison of the infinite extent of nature? This consideration is evidently too distant ever to have any effect. Or, if it had any, would it not destroy patriotism as well as ambition? The same gallant author adds with some reason, that the bright eyes of the ladies are the only objects, which lose nothing of their lustre or value from the most extensive views of astronomy, but stand proof against every system. Would philosophers advise us to limit our affection to them? 
    <br>&emsp;Exile, says Plutarch to a friend in banishment, is no evil: Mathematicians tell us, that the whole earth is but a point, compared to the heavens. To change one's country then is little more than to remove from one street to another. Man is not a plant, rooted to a certain spot of earth: All soils and all climates are alike suited to him. These topics are admirable, could they fall only into the hands of banished persons. But what if they come also to the knowledge of those who are employed in public affairs, and destroy all their attachment to their native country? Or will they operate like the quack's medicine, which is equally good for a diabetes and a dropsy? 
    <br>&emsp;It is certain, were a superior being thrust into a human body, that the whole of life would to him appear so mean, contemptible, and puerile, that he never could be induced to take part in any thing, and would scarcely give attention to what passes around him. To engage him to such a condescension as to play even the part of a Philip with zeal and alacrity, would be much more difficult, than to constrain the same Philip, after having been a king and a conqueror during fifty years, to mend old shoes with proper care and attention; the occupation which Lucian assigns him in the infernal regions. Now all the same topics of disdain towards human affairs, which could operate on this supposed being, occur also to a philosopher; but being, in some measure, disproportioned to human capacity, and not being fortified by the experience of any thing better, they make not a full impression on him. He sees, but he feels not sufficiently their truth; and is always a sublime philosopher, when he needs not; that is, as long as nothing disturbs him, or rouzes his affections. While others play, he wonders at their keenness and ardour; but he no sooner puts in his own stake, than he is commonly transported with the same passions, that he had so much condemned, while he remained a simple spectator. 
    <br>&emsp;There are two considerations chiefly, to be met with in books of philosophy, from which any important effect is to be expected, and that because these considerations are drawn from common life, and occur upon the most superficial view of human affairs. When we reflect on the shortness and uncertainty of life, how despicable seem all our pursuits of happiness? And even, if we would extend our concern beyond our own life, how frivolous appear our most enlarged and most generous projects; when we consider the incessant changes and revolutions of human affairs, by which laws and learning, books and governments are hurried away by time, as by a rapid stream, and are lost in the immense ocean of matter? Such a reflection certainly tends to mortify all our passions: But does it not thereby counterwork the artifice of nature, who has happily deceived us into an opinion, that human life is of some importance? And may not such a reflection be employed with success by voluptuous reasoners, in order to lead us, from the paths of action and virtue, into the flowery fields of indolence and pleasure? 
    <br>&emsp;We are informed by Thucydides, that, during the famous plague of Athens, when death seemed present to every one, a dissolute mirth and gaiety prevailed among the people, who exhorted one another to make the most of life as long as it endured. The same observation is made by Boccace with regard to the plague of Florence. A like principle makes soldiers, during war, be more addicted to riot and expence, than any other race of men. Present pleasure is always of importance; and whatever diminishes the importance of all other objects must bestow on it an additional influence and value. 
    <br>&emsp;The second philosophical consideration, which may often have an influence on the affections, is derived from a comparison of our own condition with the condition of others. This comparison we are continually making, even in common life; but the misfortune is, that we are rather apt to compare our situation with that of our superiors, than with that of our inferiors. A philosopher corrects this natural infirmity, by turning his view to the other side, in order to render himself easy in the situation, to which fortune has confined him. There are few people, who are not susceptible of some consolation from this reflection, though, to a very good-natured man, the view of human miseries should rather produce sorrow than comfort, and add, to his lamentations for his own misfortunes, a deep compassion for those of others. Such is the imperfection, even of the best of these philosophical topics of consolation. 
    <br>&emsp;I shall conclude this subject with observing, that, though virtue be undoubtedly the best choice, when it is attainable; yet such is the disorder and confusion of human affairs, that no perfect or regular distribution of happiness and misery is ever, in this life, to be expected. Not only the goods of fortune, and the endowments of the body (both of which are important), not only these advantages, I say, are unequally divided between the virtuous and vicious, but even the mind itself partakes, in some degree, of this disorder, and the most worthy character, by the very constitution of the passions, enjoys not always the highest felicity. 
    <br>&emsp;It is observable, that, though every bodily pain proceeds from some disorder in the part or organ, yet the pain is not always proportioned to the disorder; but is greater or less, according to the greater or less sensibility of the part, upon which the noxious humours exert their influence. A tooth-ach produces more violent convulsions of pain than a phthisis or a dropsy. In like manner, with regard to the œconomy of the mind, we may observe, that all vice is indeed pernicious; yet the disturbance or pain is not measured out by nature with exact proportion to the degree of vice, nor is the man of highest virtue, even abstracting from external accidents, always the most happy. A gloomy and melancholy disposition is certainly, to our sentiments, a vice or imperfection; but as it may be accompanied with great sense of honour and great integrity, it may be found in very worthy characters; though it is sufficient alone to imbitter life, and render the person affected with it completely miserable. On the other hand, a selfish villain may possess a spring and alacrity of temper, a certain gaiety of heart, which is indeed a good quality, but which is rewarded much beyond its merit, and when attended with good fortune, will compensate for the uneasiness and remorse arising from all the other vices. 
    <br>&emsp;I shall add, as an observation to the same purpose, that, if a man be liable to a vice or imperfection, it may often happen, that a good quality, which he possesses along with it, will render him more miserable, than if he were completely vicious. A person of such imbecility of temper as to be easily broken by affliction, is more unhappy for being endowed with a generous and friendly disposition, which gives him a lively concern for others, and exposes him the more to fortune and accidents. A sense of shame, in an imperfect character, is certainly a virtue; but produces great uneasiness and remorse, from which the abandoned villain is entirely free. A very amorous complexion, with a heart incapable of friendship, is happier than the same excess in love, with a generosity of temper, which transports a man beyond himself, and renders him a total slave to the object of his passion. 
    <br>&emsp;In a word, human life is more governed by fortune than by reason; is to be regarded more as a dull pastime than as a serious occupation; and is more influenced by particular humour, than by general principles. Shall we engage ourselves in it with passion and anxiety? It is not worthy of so much concern. Shall we be indifferent about what happens? We lose all the pleasure of the game by our phlegm and carelessness. While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone; and death, though perhaps they receive him differently, yet treats alike the fool and the philosopher. To reduce life to exact rule and method, is commonly a painful, oft a fruitless occupation: And is it not also a proof, that we overvalue the prize for which we contend? Even to reason so carefully concerning it, and to fix with accuracy its just idea, would be overvaluing it, were it not that, to some tempers, this occupation is one of the most amusing, in which life could possibly be employed.

<div id="HumanNature">
   Nothing is more usual and more natural for those, who pretend to discover any thing new to the world in philosophy and the sciences, than to insinuate the praises of their own systems, by decrying all those, which have been advanced before them. And indeed were they content with lamenting that ignorance, which we still lie under in the most important questions, that can come before the tribunal of human reason, there are few, who have an acquaintance with the sciences, that would not readily agree with them. 'Tis easy for one of judgment and learning, to perceive the weak foundation even of those systems, which have obtained the greatest credit, and have carried their pretensions highest to accurate and profound reasoning. Principles taken upon trust, consequences lamely deduced from them, want of coherence in the parts, and of evidence in the whole, these are every where to be met with in the systems of the most eminent philosophers, and seem to have drawn disgrace upon philosophy itself.
   <br>&emsp; Nor is there requir'd such profound knowledge to discover the present imperfect condition of the sciences, but even the rabble without doors may judge from the noise and clamour, which they hear, that all goes not well within. There is nothing which is not the subject of debate, and in which men of learning are not of contrary opinions. The most trivial question escapes not our controversy, and in the most momentous we are not able to give any certain decision. Disputes are multiplied, as if every thing was uncertain; and these disputes are managed with the greatest warmth, as if every thing was certain. Amidst all this bustle 'tis not reason, which carries the prize, but eloquence; and no man needs ever despair of gaining proselytes to the most extravagant hypothesis, who has art enough to represent it in any favourable colours. The victory is not gained by the men at arms, who manage the pike and the sword; but by the trumpeters, drummers, and musicians of the army.
   <br>&emsp; From hence in my opinion arises that common prejudice against metaphysical reasonings of all kinds, even amongst those, who profess themselves scholars, and have a just value for every other part of literature. By metaphysical reasonings, they do not understand those on any particular branch of science, but every kind of argument, which is any way abstruse, and requires some attention to be comprehended. We have so often lost our labour in such researches, that we commonly reject them without hesitation, and resolve, if we must for ever be a prey to errors and delusions, that they shall at least be natural and entertaining. And indeed nothing but the most determined scepticism, along with a great degree of indolence, can justify this aversion to metaphysics. For if truth be at all within the reach of human capacity, 'tis certain it must lie very deep and abstruse; and to hope we shall arrive at it without pains, while the greatest geniuses have failed with the utmost pains, must certainly be esteemed sufficiently vain and presumptuous. I pretend to no such advantage in the philosophy I am going to unfold, and would esteem it a strong presumption against it, were it so very easy and obvious.
   <br>&emsp; 'Tis evident, that all the sciences have a relation, greater or less, to human nature; and that however wide any of them may seem to run from it, they still return back by one passage or another. Even Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, are in some measure dependent on the science of Man; since they lie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties. 'Tis impossible to tell what changes and improvements we might make in these sciences were we thoroughly acquainted with the extent and force of human understanding, and cou'd explain the nature of the ideas we employ, and of the operations we perform in our reasonings. And these improvements are the more to be hoped for in natural religion, as it is not content with instructing us in the nature of superior powers, but carries its views farther, to their disposition towards us, and our duties towards them; and consequently we ourselves are not only the beings, that reason, but also one of the objects, concerning which we reason.
   <br>&emsp; If therefore the sciences of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Natural Religion, have such a dependence on the knowledge of man, what may be expected in the other sciences, whose connexion with human nature is more close and intimate? The sole end of logic is to explain the principles and operations of our reasoning faculty, and the nature of our ideas: morals and criticism regard our tastes and sentiments: and politics consider men as united in society, and dependent on each other. In these four sciences of Logic, Morals, Criticism, and Politics, is comprehended almost every thing, which it can any way import us to be acquainted with, or which can tend either to the improvement or ornament of the human mind.
   <br>&emsp; Here then is the only expedient, from which we can hope for success in our philosophical researches, to leave the tedious lingring method, which we have hitherto followed, and instead of taking now and then a castle or village on the frontier, to march up directly to the capital or center of these sciences, to human nature itself; which being once masters of, we may every where else hope for an easy victory. From this station we may extend our conquests over all those sciences, which more intimately concern human life, and may afterwards proceed at leisure to discover more fully those, which are the objects of pure curiosity. There is no question of importance, whose decision is not compriz'd in the science of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any certainty, before we become acquainted with that science. In pretending therefore to explain the principles of human nature, we in effect propose a compleat system of the sciences, built on a foundation almost entirely new, and the only one upon which they can stand with any security.
   <br>&emsp; And as the science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences, so the only solid foundation we can give to this science itself must be laid on experience and observation. 'Tis no astonishing reflection to consider, that the application of experimental philosophy to moral subjects should come after that to natural at the distance of above a whole century; since we find in fact, that there was about the same interval betwixt the origins of these sciences; and that reckoning from Thales to Socrates, the space of time is nearly equal to that betwixt my Lord Bacon[1] and some late philosophers in England, who have begun to put the science of man on a new footing, and have engaged the attention, and excited the curiosity of the public. So true it is, that however other nations may rival us in poetry, and excel us in some other agreeable arts, the improvements in reason and philosophy can only be owing to a land of toleration and of liberty.
   <br>&emsp; Nor ought we to think, that this latter improvement in the science of man will do less honour to our native country than the former in natural philosophy, but ought rather to esteem it a greater glory, upon account of the greater importance of that science, as well as the necessity it lay under of such a reformation. For to me it seems evident, that the essence of the mind being equally unknown to us with that of external bodies, it must be equally impossible to form any notion of its powers and qualities otherwise than from careful and exact experiments, and the observation of those particular effects, which result from its different circumstances and situations. And tho' we must endeavour to render all our principles as universal as possible, by tracing up our experiments to the utmost, and explaining all effects from the simplest and fewest causes, 'tis still certain we cannot go beyond experience; and any hypothesis, that pretends to discover the ultimate original qualities of human nature, ought at first to be rejected as presumptuous and chimerical.
   <br>&emsp; I do not think a philosopher, who would apply himself so earnestly to the explaining the ultimate principles of the soul, would show himself a great master in that very science of human nature, which he pretends to explain, or very knowing in what is naturally satisfactory to the mind of man. For nothing is more certain, than that despair has almost the same effect upon us with enjoyment, and that we are no sooner acquainted with the impossibility of satisfying any desire, than the desire itself vanishes. When we see, that we have arrived at the utmost extent of human reason, we sit down contented; tho' we be perfectly satisfied in the main of our ignorance, and perceive that we can give no reason for our most general and most refined principles, beside our experience of their reality; which is the reason of the mere vulgar, and what it required no study at first to have discovered for the most particular and most extraordinary phænomenon. And as this impossibility of making any farther progress is enough to satisfy the reader, so the writer may derive a more delicate satisfaction from the free confession of his ignorance, and from his prudence in avoiding that error, into which so many have fallen, of imposing their conjectures and hypotheses on the world for the most certain principles. When this mutual contentment and satisfaction can be obtained betwixt the master and scholar, I know not what more we can require of our philosophy.
   <br>&emsp; But if this impossibility of explaining ultimate principles should be esteemed a defect in the science of man, I will venture to affirm, that 'tis a defect common to it with all the sciences, and all the arts, in which we can employ ourselves, whether they be such as are cultivated in the schools of the philosophers, or practised in the shops of the meanest artizans. None of them can go beyond experience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that authority. Moral philosophy has, indeed, this peculiar disadvantage, which is not found in natural, that in collecting its experiments, it cannot make them purposely, with premeditation, and after such a manner as to satisfy itself concerning every particular difficulty which may arise. When I am at a loss to know the effects of one body upon another in any situation, I need only put them in that situation, and observe what results from it. But should I endeavour to clear up after the same manner any doubt in moral philosophy, by placing myself in the same case with that which I consider, 'tis evident this reflection and premeditation would so disturb the operation of my natural principles, as must render it impossible to form any just conclusion from the phænomenon. We must therefore glean up our experiments in this science from a cautious observation of human life, and take them as they appear in the common course of the world, by men's behaviour in company, in affairs, and in their pleasures. Where experiments of this kind are judiciously collected and compared, we may hope to establish on them a science, which will not be inferior in certainty, and will be much superior in utility to any other of human comprehension.

<div id="SpeciesPhilosophy">
   Moral philosophy, or the science of human nature, may be treated after two different manners; each of which has its peculiar merit, and may contribute to the entertainment, instruction, and reformation of mankind. The one considers man chiefly as born for action; and as influenced in his measures by taste and sentiment; pursuing one object, and avoiding another, according to the value which these objects seem to possess, and according to the light in which they present themselves. As virtue, of all objects, is allowed to be the most valuable, this species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colours; borrowing all helps from poetry and eloquence, and treating their subject in an easy and obvious manner, and such as is best fitted to please the imagination, and engage the affections. They select the most striking observations and instances from common life; place opposite characters in a proper contrast; and alluring us into the paths of virtue by the views of glory and happiness, direct our steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples. They make us feel the difference between vice and virtue; they excite and regulate our sentiments; and so they can but bend our hearts to the love of probity and true honour, they think, that they have fully attained the end of all their labours.
   <br>&emsp; The other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a reasonable rather than an active being, and endeavour to form his understanding more than cultivate his manners. They regard human nature as a subject of speculation; and with a narrow scrutiny examine it, in order to find those principles, which regulate our understanding, excite our sentiments, and make us approve or blame any particular object, action, or behaviour. They think it a reproach to all literature, that philosophy should not yet have fixed, beyond controversy, the foundation of morals, reasoning, and criticism; and should for ever talk of truth and falsehood, vice and virtue, beauty and deformity, without being able to determine the source of these distinctions. While they attempt this arduous task, they are deterred by no difficulties; but proceeding from particular instances to general principles, they still push on their enquiries to principles more general, and rest not satisfied till they arrive at those original principles, by which, in every science, all human curiosity must be bounded. Though their speculations seem abstract, and even unintelligible to common readers, they aim at the approbation of the learned and the wise; and think themselves sufficiently compensated for the labour of their whole lives, if they can discover some hidden truths, which may contribute to the instruction of posterity.
   <br>&emsp; It is certain that the easy and obvious philosophy will always, with the generality of mankind, have the preference above the accurate and abstruse; and by many will be recommended, not only as more agreeable, but more useful than the other. It enters more into common life; moulds the heart and affections; and, by touching those principles which actuate men, reforms their conduct, and brings them nearer to that model of perfection which it describes. On the contrary, the abstruse philosophy, being founded on a turn of mind, which cannot enter into business and action, vanishes when the philosopher leaves the shade, and comes into open day; nor can its principles easily retain any influence over our conduct and behaviour. The feelings of our heart, the agitation of our passions, the vehemence of our affections, dissipate all its conclusions, and reduce the profound philosopher to a mere plebeian.
   <br>&emsp; This also must be confessed, that the most durable, as well as justest fame, has been acquired by the easy philosophy, and that abstract reasoners seem hitherto to have enjoyed only a momentary reputation, from the caprice or ignorance of their own age, but have not been able to support their renown with more equitable posterity. It is easy for a profound philosopher to commit a mistake in his subtile reasonings; and one mistake is the necessary parent of another, while he pushes on his consequences, and is not deterred from embracing any conclusion, by its unusual appearance, or its contradiction to popular opinion. But a philosopher, who purposes only to represent the common sense of mankind in more beautiful and more engaging colours, if by accident he falls into error, goes no farther; but renewing his appeal to common sense, and the natural sentiments of the mind, returns into the right path, and secures himself from any dangerous illusions. The fame of Cicero flourishes at present; but that of Aristotle is utterly decayed. La Bruyere passes the seas, and still maintains his reputation: But the glory of Malebranche is confined to his own nation, and to his own age. And Addison, perhaps, will be read with pleasure, when Locke shall be entirely forgotten.
   <br>&emsp; The mere philosopher is a character, which is commonly but little acceptable in the world, as being supposed to contribute nothing either to the advantage or pleasure of society; while he lives remote from communication with mankind, and is wrapped up in principles and notions equally remote from their comprehension. On the other hand, the mere ignorant is still more despised; nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish, than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments. The most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes; retaining an equal ability and taste for books, company, and business; preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters; and in business, that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy. In order to diffuse and cultivate so accomplished a character, nothing can be more useful than compositions of the easy style and manner, which draw not too much from life, require no deep application or retreat to be comprehended, and send back the student among mankind full of noble sentiments and wise precepts, applicable to every exigence of human life. By means of such compositions, virtue becomes amiable, science agreeable, company instructive, and retirement entertaining.
   <br>&emsp; Man is a reasonable being; and as such, receives from science his proper food and nourishment: But so narrow are the bounds of human understanding, that little satisfaction can be hoped for in this particular, either from the extent or security of his acquisitions. Man is a sociable, no less than a reasonable being: But neither can he always enjoy company agreeable and amusing, or preserve the proper relish for them. Man is also an active being; and from that disposition, as well as from the various necessities of human life, must submit to business and occupation: But the mind requires some relaxation, and cannot always support its bent to care and industry. It seems, then, that nature has pointed out a mixed kind of life as most suitable to human race, and secretly admonished them to allow none of these biasses to draw too much, so as to incapacitate them for other occupations and entertainments. Indulge your passion for science, says she, but let your science be human, and such as may have a direct reference to action and society. Abstruse thought and profound researches I prohibit, and will severely punish, by the pensive melancholy which they introduce, by the endless uncertainty in which they involve you, and by the cold reception which your pretended discoveries shall meet with, when communicated. Be a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.
   <br>&emsp; Were the generality of mankind contented to prefer the easy philosophy to the abstract and profound, without throwing any blame or contempt on the latter, it might not be improper, perhaps, to comply with this general opinion, and allow every man to enjoy, without opposition, his own taste and sentiment. But as the matter is often carried farther, even to the absolute rejecting of all profound reasonings, or what is commonly called metaphysics, we shall now proceed to consider what can reasonably be pleaded in their behalf.
   <br>&emsp; We may begin with observing, that one considerable advantage, which results from the accurate and abstract philosophy, is, its subserviency to the easy and humane; which, without the former, can never attain a sufficient degree of exactness in its sentiments, precepts, or reasonings. All polite letters are nothing but pictures of human life in various attitudes and situations; and inspire us with different sentiments, of praise or blame, admiration or ridicule, according to the qualities of the object, which they set before us. An artist must be better qualified to succeed in this undertaking, who, besides a delicate taste and a quick apprehension, possesses an accurate knowledge of the internal fabric, the operations of the understanding, the workings of the passions, and the various species of sentiment which discriminate vice and virtue. How painful soever this inward search or enquiry may appear, it becomes, in some measure, requisite to those, who would describe with success the obvious and outward appearances of life and manners. The anatomist presents to the eye the most hideous and disagreeable objects; but his science is useful to the painter in delineating even a Venus or an Helen. While the latter employs all the richest colours of his art, and gives his figures the most graceful and engaging airs; he must still carry his attention to the inward structure of the human body, the position of the muscles, the fabric of the bones, and the use and figure of every part or organ. Accuracy is, in every case, advantageous to beauty, and just reasoning to delicate sentiment. In vain would we exalt the one by depreciating the other.
   <br>&emsp; Besides, we may observe, in every art or profession, even those which most concern life or action, that a spirit of accuracy, however acquired, carries all of them nearer their perfection, and renders them more subservient to the interests of society. And though a philosopher may live remote from business, the genius of philosophy, if carefully cultivated by several, must gradually diffuse itself throughout the whole society, and bestow a similar correctness on every art and calling. The politician will acquire greater foresight and subtility, in the subdividing and balancing of power; the lawyer more method and finer principles in his reasonings; and the general more regularity in his discipline, and more caution in his plans and operations. The stability of modern governments above the ancient, and the accuracy of modern philosophy, have improved, and probably will still improve, by similar gradations.
   <br>&emsp; Were there no advantage to be reaped from these studies, beyond the gratification of an innocent curiosity, yet ought not even this to be despised; as being one accession to those few safe and harmless pleasures, which are bestowed on human race. The sweetest and most inoffensive path of life leads through the avenues of science and learning; and whoever can either remove any obstructions in this way, or open up any new prospect, ought so far to be esteemed a benefactor to mankind. And though these researches may appear painful and fatiguing, it is with some minds as with some bodies, which being endowed with vigorous and florid health, require severe exercise, and reap a pleasure from what, to the generality of mankind, may seem burdensome and laborious. Obscurity, indeed, is painful to the mind as well as to the eye; but to bring light from obscurity, by whatever labour, must needs be delightful and rejoicing.
   <br>&emsp; But this obscurity in the profound and abstract philosophy, is objected to, not only as painful and fatiguing, but as the inevitable source of uncertainty and error. Here indeed lies the justest and most plausible objection against a considerable part of metaphysics, that they are not properly a science; but arise either from the fruitless efforts of human vanity, which would penetrate into subjects utterly inaccessible to the understanding, or from the craft of popular superstitions, which, being unable to defend themselves on fair ground, raise these intangling brambles to cover and protect their weakness. Chaced from the open country, these robbers fly into the forest, and lie in wait to break in upon every unguarded avenue of the mind, and overwhelm it with religious fears and prejudices. The stoutest antagonist, if he remit his watch a moment, is oppressed. And many, through cowardice and folly, open the gates to the enemies, and willingly receive them with reverence and submission, as their legal sovereigns.
   <br>&emsp; But is this a sufficient reason, why philosophers should desist from such researches, and leave superstition still in possession of her retreat? Is it not proper to draw an opposite conclusion, and perceive the necessity of carrying the war into the most secret recesses of the enemy? In vain do we hope, that men, from frequent disappointment, will at last abandon such airy sciences, and discover the proper province of human reason. For, besides, that many persons find too sensible an interest in perpetually recalling such topics; besides this, I say, the motive of blind despair can never reasonably have place in the sciences; since, however unsuccessful former attempts may have proved, there is still room to hope, that the industry, good fortune, or improved sagacity of succeeding generations may reach discoveries unknown to former ages. Each adventurous genius will still leap at the arduous prize, and find himself stimulated, rather than discouraged, by the failures of his predecessors; while he hopes that the glory of atchieving so hard an adventure is reserved for him alone. The only method of freeing learning, at once, from these abstruse questions, is to enquire seriously into the nature of human understanding, and shew, from an exact analysis of its powers and capacity, that it is by no means fitted for such remote and abstruse subjects. We must submit to this fatigue, in order to live at ease ever after: And must cultivate true metaphysics with some care, in order to destroy the false and adulterate. Indolence, which, to some persons, affords a safeguard against this deceitful philosophy, is, with others, overbalanced by curiosity; and despair, which, at some moments, prevails, may give place afterwards to sanguine hopes and expectations. Accurate and just reasoning is the only catholic remedy, fitted for all persons and all dispositions; and is alone able to subvert that abstruse philosophy and metaphysical jargon, which, being mixed up with popular superstition, renders it in a manner impenetrable to careless reasoners, and gives it the air of science and wisdom.
   <br>&emsp; Besides this advantage of rejecting, after deliberate enquiry, the most uncertain and disagreeable part of learning, there are many positive advantages, which result from an accurate scrutiny into the powers and faculties of human nature. It is remarkable concerning the operations of the mind, that, though most intimately present to us, yet, whenever they become the object of reflection, they seem involved in obscurity; nor can the eye readily find those lines and boundaries, which discriminate and distinguish them. The objects are too fine to remain long in the same aspect or situation; and must be apprehended in an instant, by a superior penetration, derived from nature, and improved by habit and reflection. It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable part of science barely to know the different operations of the mind, to separate them from each other, to class them under their proper heads, and to correct all that seeming disorder, in which they lie involved, when made the object of reflection and enquiry. This task of ordering and distinguishing, which has no merit, when performed with regard to external bodies, the objects of our senses, rises in its value, when directed towards the operations of the mind, in proportion to the difficulty and labour, which we meet with in performing it. And if we can go no farther than this mental geography, or delineation of the distinct parts and powers of the mind, it is at least a satisfaction to go so far; and the more obvious this science may appear (and it is by no means obvious) the more contemptible still must the ignorance of it be esteemed, in all pretenders to learning and philosophy.
   <br>&emsp; Nor can there remain any suspicion, that this science is uncertain and chimerical; unless we should entertain such a scepticism as is entirely subversive of all speculation, and even action. It cannot be doubted, that the mind is endowed with several powers and faculties, that these powers are distinct from each other, that what is really distinct to the immediate perception may be distinguished by reflection; and consequently, that there is a truth and falsehood in all propositions on this subject, and a truth and falsehood, which lie not beyond the compass of human understanding. There are many obvious distinctions of this kind, such as those between the will and understanding, the imagination and passions, which fall within the comprehension of every human creature; and the finer and more philosophical distinctions are no less real and certain, though more difficult to be comprehended. Some instances, especially late ones, of success in these enquiries, may give us a juster notion of the certainty and solidity of this branch of learning. And shall we esteem it worthy the labour of a philosopher to give us a true system of the planets, and adjust the position and order of those remote bodies; while we affect to overlook those, who, with so much success, delineate the parts of the mind, in which we are so intimately concerned?
   <br>&emsp; But may we not hope, that philosophy, if cultivated with care, and encouraged by the attention of the public, may carry its researches still farther, and discover, at least in some degree, the secret springs and principles, by which the human mind is actuated in its operations? Astronomers had long contented themselves with proving, from the phænomena, the true motions, order, and magnitude of the heavenly bodies: Till a philosopher, at last, arose, who seems, from the happiest reasoning, to have also determined the laws and forces, by which the revolutions of the planets are governed and directed. The like has been performed with regard to other parts of nature. And there is no reason to despair of equal success in our enquiries concerning the mental powers and œconomy, if prosecuted with equal capacity and caution. It is probable, that one operation and principle of the mind depends on another; which, again, may be resolved into one more general and universal: And how far these researches may possibly be carried, it will be difficult for us, before, or even after, a careful trial, exactly to determine. This is certain, that attempts of this kind are every day made even by those who philosophize the most negligently: And nothing can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprize with thorough care and attention; that, if it lie within the compass of human understanding, it may at last be happily atchieved; if not, it may, however, be rejected with some confidence and security. This last conclusion, surely, is not desirable; nor ought it to be embraced too rashly. For how much must we diminish from the beauty and value of this species of philosophy, upon such a supposition? Moralists have hitherto been accustomed, when they considered the vast multitude and diversity of those actions that excite our approbation or dislike, to search for some common principle, on which this variety of sentiments might depend. And though they have sometimes carried the matter too far, by their passion for some one general principle; it must, however, be confessed, that they are excusable in expecting to find some general principles, into which all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved. The like has been the endeavour of critics, logicians, and even politicians: Nor have their attempts been wholly unsuccessful; though perhaps longer time, greater accuracy, and more ardent application may bring these sciences still nearer their perfection. To throw up at once all pretensions of this kind may justly be deemed more rash, precipitate, and dogmatical, than even the boldest and most affirmative philosophy, that has ever attempted to impose its crude dictates and principles on mankind.
   <br>&emsp; What though these reasonings concerning human nature seem abstract, and of difficult comprehension? This affords no presumption of their falsehood. On the contrary, it seems impossible, that what has hitherto escaped so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and easy. And whatever pains these researches may cost us, we may think ourselves sufficiently rewarded, not only in point of profit but of pleasure, if, by that means, we can make any addition to our stock of knowledge, in subjects of such unspeakable importance.
   <br>&emsp; But as, after all, the abstractedness of these speculations is no recommendation, but rather a disadvantage to them, and as this difficulty may perhaps be surmounted by care and art, and the avoiding of all unnecessary detail, we have, in the following enquiry, attempted to throw some light upon subjects, from which uncertainty has hitherto deterred the wise, and obscurity the ignorant. Happy, if we can unite the boundaries of the different species of philosophy, by reconciling profound enquiry with clearness, and truth with novelty! And still more happy, if, reasoning in this easy manner, we can undermine the foundations of an abstruse philosophy, which seems to have hitherto served only as a shelter to superstition, and a cover to absurdity and error!

   Disputes with men, pertinaciously obstinate in their principles, are, of all others, the most irksome; except, perhaps, those with persons, entirely disingenuous, who really do not believe the opinions they defend, but engage in the controversy, from affectation, from a spirit of opposition, or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity, superior to the rest of mankind. The same blind adherence to their own arguments is to be expected in both; the same contempt of their antagonists; and the same passionate vehemence, in inforcing sophistry and falsehood. And as reasoning is not the source, whence either disputant derives his tenets; it is in vain to expect, that any logic, which speaks not to the affections, will ever engage him to embrace sounder principles.
   <br>&emsp; Those who have denied the reality of moral distinctions, may be ranked among the disingenuous disputants; nor is it conceivable, that any human creature could ever seriously believe, that all characters and actions were alike entitled to the affection and regard of every one. The difference, which nature has placed between one man and another, is so wide, and this difference is still so much farther widened, by education, example, and habit, that, where the opposite extremes come at once under our apprehension, there is no scepticism so scrupulous, and scarce any assurance so determined, as absolutely to deny all distinction between them. Let a man's insensibility be ever so great, he must often be touched with the images of RIGHT and WRONG; and let his prejudices be ever so obstinate, he must observe, that others are susceptible of like impressions. The only way, therefore, of converting an antagonist of this kind, is to leave him to himself. For, finding that no body keeps up the controversy with him, it is probable he will, at last, of himself, from mere weariness, come over to the side of common sense and reason.
   <br>&emsp; There has been a controversy started of late, much better worth examination, concerning the general foundation of MORALS; whether they be derived from REASON, or from SENTIMENT; whether we attain the knowledge of them by a chain of argument and induction, or by an immediate feeling and finer internal sense; whether, like all sound judgment of truth and falsehood, they should be the same to every rational intelligent being; or whether, like the perception of beauty and deformity, they be founded entirely on the particular fabric and constitution of the human species.
   <br>&emsp; The ancient philosophers, though they often affirm, that virtue is nothing but conformity to reason, yet, in general, seem to consider morals as deriving their existence from taste and sentiment. On the other hand, our modern enquirers, though they also talk much of the beauty of virtue, and deformity of vice, yet have commonly endeavoured to account for these distinctions by metaphysical reasonings, and by deductions from the most abstract principles of the understanding. Such confusion reigned in these subjects, that an opposition of the greatest consequence could prevail between one system and another, and even in the parts of almost each individual system; and yet no body, till very lately, was ever sensible of it. The elegant Lord Shaftesbury, who first gave occasion to remark this distinction, and who, in general, adhered to the principles of the ancients, is not, himself, entirely free from the same confusion.
   <br>&emsp; It must be acknowledged, that both sides of the question are susceptible of specious arguments. Moral distinctions, it may be said, are discernible by pure reason: Else, whence the many disputes that reign in common life, as well as in philosophy, with regard to this subject: The long chain of proofs often produced on both sides; the examples cited, the authorities appealed to, the analogies employed, the fallacies detected, the inferences drawn, and the several conclusions adjusted to their proper principles. Truth is disputable; not taste: What exists in the nature of things is the standard of our judgment; what each man feels within himself is the standard of sentiment. Propositions in geometry may be proved, systems in physics may be controverted; but the harmony of verse, the tenderness of passion, the brilliancy of wit, must give immediate pleasure. No man reasons concerning another's beauty; but frequently concerning the justice or injustice of his actions. In every criminal trial the first object of the prisoner is to disprove the facts alleged, and deny the actions imputed to him: The second to prove, that, even if these actions were real, they might be justified, as innocent and lawful. It is confessedly by deductions of the understanding, that the first point is ascertained: How can we suppose that a different faculty of the mind is employed in fixing the other?
   <br>&emsp; On the other hand, those who would resolve all moral determinations into sentiment, may endeavour to show, that it is impossible for reason ever to draw conclusions of this nature. To virtue, say they, it belongs to be amiable, and vice odious. This forms their very nature or essence. But can reason or argumentation distribute these different epithets to any subjects, and pronounce before-hand, that this must produce love, and that hatred? Or what other reason can we ever assign for these affections, but the original fabric and formation of the human mind, which is naturally adapted to receive them?
   <br>&emsp; The end of all moral speculations is to teach us our duty; and, by proper representations of the deformity of vice and beauty of virtue, beget correspondent habits, and engage us to avoid the one, and embrace the other. But is this ever to be expected from inferences and conclusions of the understanding, which of themselves have no hold of the affections, or set in motion the active powers of men? They discover truths: But where the truths which they discover are indifferent, and beget no desire or aversion, they can have no influence on conduct and behaviour. What is honourable, what is fair, what is becoming, what is noble, what is generous, takes possession of the heart, and animates us to embrace and maintain it. What is intelligible, what is evident, what is probable, what is true, procures only the cool assent of the understanding; and gratifying a speculative curiosity, puts an end to our researches.
   <br>&emsp; Extinguish all the warm feelings and prepossessions in favour of virtue, and all disgust or aversion to vice: Render men totally indifferent towards these distinctions; and morality is no longer a practical study, nor has any tendency to regulate our lives and actions.
   <br>&emsp; These arguments on each side (and many more might be produced) are so plausible, that I am apt to suspect, they may, the one as well as the other, be solid and satisfactory, and that reason and sentiment concur in almost all moral determinations and conclusions. The final sentence, it is probable, which pronounces characters and actions amiable or odious, praise-worthy or blameable; that which stamps on them the mark of honour or infamy, approbation or censure; that which renders morality an active principle, and constitutes virtue our happiness, and vice our misery: It is probable, I say, that this final sentence depends on some internal sense or feeling, which nature has made universal in the whole species. For what else can have an influence of this nature? But in order to pave the way for such a sentiment, and give a proper discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we find, that much reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be made, just conclusions drawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations examined, and general facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of beauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first appearance, command our affection and approbation; and where they fail of this effect, it is impossible for any reasoning to redress their influence, or adapt them better to our taste and sentiment. But in many orders of beauty, particularly those of the finer arts, it is requisite to employ much reasoning, in order to feel the proper sentiment; and a false relish may frequently be corrected by argument and reflection. There are just grounds to conclude, that moral beauty partakes much of this latter species, and demands the assistance of our intellectual faculties, in order to give it a suitable influence on the human mind.
   <br>&emsp; But though this question, concerning the general principles of morals, be curious and important, it is needless for us, at present, to employ farther care in our researches concerning it. For if we can be so happy, in the course of this enquiry, as to discover the true origin of morals, it will then easily appear how far either sentiment or reason enters into all determinations of this nature[1]. In order to attain this purpose, we shall endeavour to follow a very simple method: We shall analyze that complication of mental qualities, which form what, in common life, we call Personal Merit: We shall consider every attribute of the mind, which renders a man an object either of esteem and affection, or of hatred and contempt; every habit or sentiment or faculty, which, if ascribed to any person, implies either praise or blame, and may enter into any panegyric or satire of his character and manners. The quick sensibility, which, on this head, is so universal among mankind, gives a philosopher sufficient assurance, that he can never be considerably mistaken in framing the catalogue, or incur any danger of misplacing the objects of his contemplation: He needs only enter into his own breast for a moment, and consider whether or not he should desire to have this or that quality ascribed to him, and whether such or such an imputation would proceed from a friend or an enemy. The very nature of language guides us almost infallibly in forming a judgment of this nature; and as every tongue possesses one set of words which are taken in a good sense, and another in the opposite, the least acquaintance with the idiom suffices, without any reasoning, to direct us in collecting and arranging the estimable or blameable qualities of men. The only object of reasoning is to discover the circumstances on both sides, which are common to these qualities; to observe that particular in which the estimable qualities agree on the one hand, and the blameable on the other; and thence to reach the foundation of ethics, and find those universal principles, from which all censure or approbation is ultimately derived. As this is a question of fact, not of abstract science, we can only expect success, by following the experimental method, and deducing general maxims from a comparison of particular instances. The other scientifical method, where a general abstract principle is first established, and is afterwards branched out into a variety of inferences and conclusions, may be more perfect in itself, but suits less the imperfection of human nature, and is a common source of illusion and mistake in this as well as in other subjects. Men are now cured of their passion for hypotheses and systems in natural philosophy, and will hearken to no arguments but those which are derived from experience. It is full time they should attempt a like reformation in all moral disquisitions; and reject every system of ethics, however subtile or ingenious, which is not founded on fact and observation.
   <br>&emsp; We shall begin our enquiry on this head by the consideration of the social virtues, benevolence and justice. The explication of them will probably give us an opening by which the others may be accounted for.Of the General Principles of Morals.

<div id="VerbalDisputes">
   nothing is more usual than for philosophers to encroach upon the province of grammarians; and to engage in disputes of words, while they imagine that they are handling controversies of the deepest importance and concern. It was in order to avoid altercations, so frivolous and endless, that I endeavoured to state with the utmost caution the object of our present enquiry; and proposed simply to collect, on the one hand, a list of those mental qualities which are the object of love or esteem, and form a part of personal merit, and on the other hand, a catalogue of those qualities, which are the object of censure or reproach, and which detract from the character of the person, possessed of them; subjoining some reflections concerning the origin of these sentiments of praise or blame. On all occasions, where there might arise the least hesitation, I avoided the terms virtue and vice; because some of those qualities, which I classed among the objects of praise, receive, in the English language, the appellation of talents, rather than of virtues; as some of the blameable or censurable qualities are often called defects, rather than vices. It may now, perhaps, be expected, that, before we conclude this moral enquiry, we should exactly separate the one from the other; should mark the precise boundaries of virtues and talents, vices and defects; and should explain the reason and origin of that distinction. But in order to excuse myself from this undertaking, which would, at last, prove only a grammatical enquiry, I shall subjoin the four following reflections, which shall contain all that I intend to say on the present subject.
   <br>&emsp;First, I do not find, that in the English, or any other modern tongue, the boundaries are exactly fixed between virtues and talents, vices and defects, or that a precise definition can be given of the one as contradistinguished from the other. Were we to say, for instance, that the esteemable qualities alone, which are voluntary, are entitled to the appellations of virtues; we should soon recollect the qualities of courage, equanimity, patience, self-command; with many others, which almost every language classes under this appellation, though they depend little or not at all on our choice. Should we affirm, that the qualities alone, which prompt us to act our part in society, are entitled to that honourable distinction; it must immediately occur, that these are indeed the most valuable qualities, and are commonly denominated the social virtues; but that this very epithet supposes, that there are also virtues of another species. Should we lay hold of the distinction between intellectual and moral endowments, and affirm the last alone to be the real and genuine virtues, because they alone lead to action; we should find, that many of those qualities, usually called intellectual virtues, such as prudence, penetration, discernment, discretion, had also a considerable influence on conduct. The distinction between the heart and the head may also be adopted: The qualities of the first may be defined such as in their immediate exertion are accompanied with a feeling of sentiment; and these alone may be called the genuine virtues: But industry, frugality, temperance, secrecy, perseverance, and many other laudable powers or habits, generally stiled virtues are exerted without any immediate sentiment in the person possessed of them; and are only known to him by their effects. It is fortunate, amidst all this seeming perplexity, that the question, being merely verbal, cannot possibly be of any importance. A moral, philosophical discourse needs not enter into all these caprices of language, which are so variable in different dialects, and in different ages of the same dialect. But on the whole, it seems to me, that, though it is always allowed, that there are virtues of many different kinds, yet, when a man is called virtuous, or is denominated a man of virtue, we chiefly regard his social qualities, which are, indeed, the most valuable. It is, at the same time, certain, that any remarkable defect in courage, temperance, œconomy, industry, understanding, dignity of mind, would bereave even a very good-natured, honest man of this honourable appellation. Who did ever say, except by way of irony, that such a one was a man of great virtue, but an egregious blockhead?
   <br>&emsp;But, secondly, it is no wonder, that languages should not be very precise in marking the boundaries between virtues and talents, vices and defects; since there is so little distinction made in our internal estimation of them. It seems indeed certain, that the sentiment of conscious worth, the self-satisfaction proceeding from a review of a man's own conduct and character; it seems certain, I say, that this sentiment, which, though the most common of all others, has no proper name in our language, arises from the endowments of courage and capacity, industry and ingenuity, as well as from any other mental excellencies. Who, on the other hand, is not deeply mortified with reflecting on his own folly and dissoluteness, and feels not a secret sting or compunction, whenever his memory presents any past occurrence, where he behaved with stupidity or ill-manners? No time can efface the cruel ideas of a man's own foolish conduct, or of affronts, which cowardice or impudence has brought upon him. They still haunt his solitary hours, damp his most aspiring thoughts, and show him, even to himself, in the most contemptible and most odious colours imaginable.
   <br>&emsp;What is there too we are more anxious to conceal from others than such blunders, infirmities, and meannesses, or more dread to have exposed by raillery and satire? And is not the chief object of vanity, our bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our eloquence or address, our taste or abilities? These we display with care, if not with ostentation; and we commonly show more ambition of excelling in them, than even in the social virtues themselves, which are, in reality, of such superior excellence. Good-nature and honesty, especially the latter, are so indispensably required, that, though the greatest censure attends any violation of these duties, no eminent praise follows such common instances of them, as seem essential to the support of human society. And hence the reason, in my opinion, why, though men often extol so liberally the qualities of their heart, they are shy in commending the endowments of their head: Because the latter virtues, being supposed more rare and extraordinary, are observed to be the more usual objects of pride and self-conceit; and when boasted of, beget a strong suspicion of these sentiments.
   <br>&emsp;It is hard to tell, whether you hurt a man's character most by calling him a knave or a coward, and whether a beastly glutton or drunkard be not as odious and contemptible, as a selfish, ungenerous miser. Give me my choice, and I would rather, for my own happiness and self-enjoyment, have a friendly, humane heart, than possess all the other virtues of Demosthenes and Philip united: But I would rather pass with the world for one endowed with extensive genius and intrepid courage, and should thence expect stronger instances of general applause and admiration. The figure which a man makes in life, the reception which he meets with in company, the esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advantages depend as much upon his good sense and judgment, as upon any other part of his character. Had a man the best intentions in the world, and were the farthest removed from all injustice and violence, he would never be able to make himself be much regarded, without a moderate share, at least, of parts and understanding.
   <br>&emsp;What is it then we can here dispute about? If sense and courage, temperance and industry, wisdom and knowledge confessedly form a considerable part of personal merit: if a man, possessed of these qualities, is both better satisfied with himself, and better entitled to the good-will, esteem, and services of others, than one entirely destitute of them; if, in short, the sentiments are similar, which arise from these endowments and from the social virtues; is there any reason for being so extremely scrupulous about a word, or disputing whether they be entitled to the denomination of virtues? It may, indeed, be pretended, that the sentiment of approbation, which those accomplishments produce, besides its being inferior, is also somewhat different from that, which attends the virtues of justice and humanity. But this seems not a sufficient reason for ranking them entirely under different classes and appellations. The character of Cæsar and that of Cato, as drawn by Sallust, are both of them virtuous, in the strictest and most limited sense of the word; but in a different way: Nor are the sentiments entirely the same, which arise from them. The one produces love; the other, esteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We should wish to meet the one character in a friend; the other we should be ambitious of in ourselves. In like manner the approbation, which attends temperance or industry or frugality, may be somewhat different from that which is paid to the social virtues, without making them entirely of a different species. And, indeed, we may observe, that these endowments, more than the other virtues, produce not, all of them, the same kind of approbation. Good sense and genius beget esteem and regard: Wit and humour excite love and affection.
   <br>&emsp;Most people, I believe, will naturally, without premeditation, assent to the definition of the elegant and judicious poet.
   <br>&emsp;Virtue (for mere good-nature is a fool)
   <br>&emsp;Is sense and spirit with humanity.
   <br>&emsp;What pretensions has a man to our generous assistance or good offices, who has dissipated his wealth in profuse expences, idle vanities, chimerical projects, dissolute pleasures, or extravagant gaming? These vices (for we scruple not to call them such) bring misery unpitied, and contempt on every one addicted to them.
   <br>&emsp;Achæus, a wise and prudent prince, fell into a fatal snare, which cost him his crown and life, after having used every reasonable precaution to guard himself against it. On that account, says the historian, he is a just object of regard and compassion: His betrayers alone of hatred and contempt.
   <br>&emsp;The precipitate flight and improvident negligence of Pompey, at the beginning of the civil wars, appeared such notorious blunders to Cicero, as quite palled his friendship towards that great man. In the same manner, says he, as want of cleanliness, decency, or discretion in a mistress are found to alienate our affections. For so he expresses himself, where he talks, not in the character of a philosopher, but in that of a statesman and man of the world, to his friend Atticus.
   <br>&emsp;But the same Cicero, in imitation of all the ancient moralists, when he reasons as a philosopher, enlarges very much his ideas of virtue, and comprehends every laudable quality or endowment of the mind, under that honourable appellation. This leads to the third reflection, which we proposed to make, to wit, that the ancient moralists, the best models, made no material distinction among the different species of mental endowments and defects, but treated all alike under the appellation of virtues and vices, and made them indiscriminately the object of their moral reasonings. The prudence explained in Cicero's Offices, is that sagacity, which leads to the discovery of truth, and preserves us from error and mistake. Magnanimity, temperance, decency, are there also at large discoursed of. And as that eloquent moralist followed the common received division of the four cardinal virtues, our social duties form but one head, in the general distribution of his subject.
   <br>&emsp;We need only peruse the titles of chapters in Aristotle's Ethics to be convinced, that he ranks courage, temperance, magnificence, magnanimity, modesty, prudence, and a manly openness, among the virtues, as well as justice and friendship.
   <br>&emsp;To sustain and to abstain, that is, to be patient and continent, appeared to some of the ancients a summary comprehension of all morals.
   <br>&emsp;Epictetus has scarcely ever mentioned the sentiment of humanity and compassion, but in order to put his disciples on their guard against it. The virtue of the Stoics seems to consist chiefly in a firm temper and a sound understanding. With them, as with Solomon and the eastern moralists, folly and wisdom are equivalent to vice and virtue.
   <br>&emsp;Men will praise thee, says David, when thou dost well unto thyself. I hate a wise man, says the Greek poet, who is not wise to himself.
   <br>&emsp;Plutarch is no more cramped by systems in his philosophy than in his history. Where he compares the great men of Greece and Rome, he fairly sets in opposition all their blemishes and accomplishments of whatever kind, and omits nothing considerable, which can either depress or exalt their characters. His moral discourses contain the same free and natural censure of men and manners.
   <br>&emsp;The character of Hannibal, as drawn by Livy, is esteemed partial, but allows him many eminent virtues. Never was there a genius, says the historian, more equally fitted for those opposite offices of commanding and obeying; and it were, therefore, difficult to determine whether he rendered himself dearer to the general or to the army. To none would Hasdrubal entrust more willingly the conduct of any dangerous enterprize; under none, did the soldiers discover more courage and confidence. Great boldness in facing danger; great prudence in the midst of it. No labour could fatigue his body or subdue his mind. Cold and heat were indifferent to him: Meat and drink he sought as supplies to the necessities of nature, not as gratifications of his voluptuous appetites: Waking or rest he used indiscriminately, by night or by day.—These great Virtues were balanced by great : Inhuman cruelty; perfidy more than punic; no truth, no faith, no regard to oaths, promises, or religion.
   <br>&emsp;The character of Alexander the Sixth, to be found in Guicciardin, is pretty similar, but juster; and is a proof that even the moderns, where they speak naturally, hold the same language with the ancients. In this pope, says he, there was a singular capacity and judgment: Admirable prudence; a wonderful talent of persuasion; and in all momentous enterprizes, a diligence and dexterity incredible. But these virtues were infinitely overbalanced by his vices; no faith, no religion, insatiable avarice, exorbitant ambition, and a more than barbarous cruelty.
   <br>&emsp;Polybius, reprehending Timæus for his partiality against Agathocles, whom he himself allows to be the most cruel and impious of all tyrants, says: If he took refuge in Syracuse, as asserted by that historian, flying the dirt and smoke and toil of his former profession of a potter; and if proceeding from such slender beginnings, he became master, in a little time, of all Sicily; brought the Carthaginian state into the utmost danger; and at last died in old age, and in possession of sovereign dignity: Must he not be allowed something prodigious and extraordinary, and to have possessed great talents and capacity for business and action? His historian, therefore, ought not to have alone related what tended to his reproach and infamy; but also what might redound to his Praise and Honour.
   <br>&emsp;In general, we may observe, that the distinction of voluntary or involuntary was little regarded by the ancients in their moral reasonings; where they frequently treated the question as very doubtful, whether virtue could be taught or not? They justly considered, that cowardice, meanness, levity, anxiety, impatience, folly, and many other qualities of the mind, might appear ridiculous and deformed, contemptible and odious, though independent of the will. Nor could it be supposed, at all times, in every man's power to attain every kind of mental, more than of exterior beauty.
   <br>&emsp;And here there occurs the fourth reflection which I purposed to make, in suggesting the reason, why modern philosophers have often followed a course, in their moral enquiries, so different from that of the ancients. In later times, philosophy of all kinds, especially ethics, have been more closely united with theology than ever they were observed to be among the Heathens; and as this latter science admits of no terms of composition, but bends every branch of knowledge to its own purpose, without much regard to the phænomena of nature, or to the unbiassed sentiments of the mind, hence reasoning, and even language, have been warped from their natural course, and distinctions have been endeavoured to be established, where the difference of the objects was, in a manner, imperceptible. Philosophers, or rather divines under that disguise, treating all morals, as on a like footing with civil laws, guarded by the sanctions of reward and punishment, were necessarily led to render this circumstance, of voluntary or involuntary, the foundation of their whole theory. Every one may employ terms in what sense he pleases: But this, in the mean time, must be allowed, that sentiments are every day experienced of blame and praise, which have objects beyond the dominion of the will or choice, and of which it behoves us, if not as moralists, as speculative philosophers at least, to give some satisfactory theory and explication.
   <br>&emsp;A blemish, a fault, a vice, a crime; these expressions seem to denote different degrees of censure and disapprobation; which are, however, all of them, at the bottom, pretty nearly all the same kind of species. The explication of one will easily lead us into a just conception of the others; and it is of greater consequence to attend to things than to verbal appellations. That we owe a duty to ourselves is confessed even in the most vulgar system of morals; and it must be of consequence to examine that duty, in order to see whether it bears any affinity to that which we owe to society. It is probable, that the approbation, attending the observance of both, is of a similar nature, and arises from similar principles; whatever appellation we may give to either of these excellencies.

   <div id="DelicacyTaste">
   Some People are subject to a certain delicacy of passion, which makes them extremely sensible to all the accidents of life, and gives them a lively joy upon every prosperous event, as well as a piercing grief, when they meet with misfortunes and adversity. Favours and good offices easily engage their friendship; while the smallest injury provokes their resentment. Any honour or mark of distinction elevates them above measure; but they are as sensibly touched with contempt. People of this character have, no doubt, more lively enjoyments, as well as more pungent sorrows, than men of cool and sedate tempers: But, I believe, when every thing is balanced, there is no one, who would not rather be of the latter character, were he entirely master of his own disposition. Good or ill fortune is very little at our disposal: And when a person, that has this sensibility of temper, meets with any misfortune, his sorrow or resentment takes entire possession of him, and deprives him of all relish in the common occurrences of life; the right enjoyment of which forms the chief part of our happiness. Great pleasures are much less frequent than great pains; so that a sensible temper must meet with fewer trials in the former way than in the latter. Not to mention, that men of such lively passions are apt to be transported beyond all bounds of prudence and discretion, and to take false steps in the conduct of life, which are often irretrievable.
   <br>&emsp;There is a delicacy of taste observable in some men, which very much resembles this delicacy of passion, and produces the same sensibility to beauty and deformity of every kind, as that does to prosperity and adversity, obligations and injuries. When you present a poem or a picture to a man possessed of this talent, the delicacy of his feeling makes him be sensibly touched with every part of it; nor are the masterly strokes perceived with more exquisite relish and satisfaction, than the negligences or absurdities with disgust and uneasiness. A polite and judicious conversation affords him the highest entertainment; rudeness or impertinence is as great a punishment to him. In short, delicacy of taste has the same effect as delicacy of passion: It enlarges the sphere both of our happiness and misery, and makes us sensible to pains as well as pleasures, which escape the rest of mankind.
   <br>&emsp;I believe, however, every one will agree with me, that, notwithstanding this resemblance, delicacy of taste is as much to be desired and cultivated as delicacy of passion is to be lamented, and to be remedied, if possible. The good or ill accidents of life are very little at our disposal; but we are pretty much masters what books we shall read, what diversions we shall partake of, and what company we shall keep. Philosophers have endeavoured to render happiness entirely independent of every thing external. That degree of perfection is impossible to be attained: But every wise man will endeavour to place his happiness on such objects chiefly as depend upon himself: and that is not to be attained so much by any other means as by this delicacy of sentiment. When a man is possessed of that talent, he is more happy by what pleases his taste, than by what gratifies his appetites, and receives more enjoyment from a poem or a piece of reasoning than the most expensive luxury can afford.
   <br>&emsp;Whatever connexion there may be originally between these two species of delicacy, I am persuaded, that nothing is so proper to cure us of this delicacy of passion, as the cultivating of that higher and more refined taste, which enables us to judge of the characters of men, of compositions of genius, and of the productions of the nobler arts. A greater or less relish for those obvious beauties, which strike the senses, depends entirely upon the greater or less sensibility of the temper: But with regard to the sciences and liberal arts, a fine taste is, in some measure, the same with strong sense, or at least depends so much upon it, that they are inseparable. In order to judge aright of a composition of genius, there are so many views to be taken in, so many circumstances to be compared, and such a knowledge of human nature requisite, that no man, who is not possessed of the soundest judgment, will ever make a tolerable critic in such performances. And this is a new reason for cultivating a relish in the liberal arts. Our judgment will strengthen by this exercise: We shall form juster notions of life: Many things, which please or afflict others, will appear to us too frivolous to engage our attention: And we shall lose by degrees that sensibility and delicacy of passion, which is so incommodious.
   <br>&emsp;But perhaps I have gone too far in saying, that a cultivated taste for the polite arts extinguishes the passions, and renders us indifferent to those objects, which are so fondly pursued by the rest of mankind. On farther reflection, I find, that it rather improves our sensibility for all the tender and agreeable passions; at the same time that it renders the mind incapable of the rougher and more boisterous emotions.
   <br>&emsp;For this, I think there may be assigned two very natural reasons. In the first place, nothing is so improving to the temper as the study of the beauties, either of poetry, eloquence, music, or painting. They give a certain elegance of sentiment to which the rest of mankind are strangers. The emotions which they excite are soft and tender. They draw off the mind from the hurry of business and interest; cherish reflection; dispose to tranquillity; and produce an agreeable melancholy, which, of all dispositions of the mind, is the best suited to love and friendship.
   <br>&emsp;In the second place, a delicacy of taste is favourable to love and friendship, by confining our choice to few people, and making us indifferent to the company and conversation of the greater part of men. You will seldom find, that mere men of the world, whatever strong sense they may be endowed with, are very nice in distinguishing characters, or in marking those insensible differences and gradations, which make one man preferable to another. Any one, that has competent sense, is sufficient for their entertainment: They talk to him, of their pleasure and affairs, with the same frankness that they would to another; and finding many, who are fit to supply his place, they never feel any vacancy or want in his absence. But to make use of the allusion of a celebrated French author, the judgment may be compared to a clock or watch, where the most ordinary machine is sufficient to tell the hours; but the most elaborate alone can point out the minutes and seconds, and distinguish the smallest differences of time. One that has well digested his knowledge both of books and men, has little enjoyment but in the company of a few select companions. He feels too sensibly, how much all the rest of mankind fall short of the notions which he has entertained. And, his affections being thus confined within a narrow circle, no wonder he carries them further, than if they were more general and undistinguished. The gaiety and frolic of a bottle companion improves with him into a solid friendship: And the ardours of a youthful appetite become an elegant passion.

<div id="LetterFoucher">

       I agree with you that it is important once and for all to examine all of our assumptions in order to establish something solid. For I hold that it is only when we can prove everything we assert that we understand perfectly the thing under consideration. I know that such studies are not popular with the common people, but I also know that the common people do not take the trouble to understand things at their deepest level. Your aim, so far as I can see, is to examine all the truths which affirm that there is something outside of us. You seem to be quite fair in this enterprise, for you grant us all the hypothetical truths which affirm, not that there is something outside of us, but only what would happen if there were things outside of us. Thus we already save arithmetic, geometry, and a large number of propositions of metaphysics, physics, and morality, propositions whose proper expression depends on arbitrarily chosen definitions, and whose truth depends on axioms which I commonly call identities, such as, for example, that two contradictories cannot both be, that a thing is what it is at a given time—that it is, for example, as large as it is, or equal to itself, that it is similar to itself, etc. But although you quite deliberately do not enter into an examination of hypothetical propositions, I am, nevertheless, of the opinion that this should be done and that we should not admit any that have not been demonstrated completely and resolved into identities.
   
       <br>&emsp;The principal subject of your inquiry concerns the truths that deal with what is really outside of us. Now, in the first place, we cannot deny that the very truth of hypothetical propositions is something outside of us, something that does not depend on us. For all hypothetical propositions assert what would be or what would not be if something or its contrary were posited; and consequently, they assert that the simultaneous assumption of two things in agreement with one another is possible or impossible, necessary or indifferent, or they assert that one single thing is possible or impossible, necessary or indifferent. This possibility, impossibility, or necessity (for the necessity of something is the impossibility of its contrary) is not a chimera we create, since we do nothing more than recognize it, in spite of ourselves and in a consistent manner. Thus of all things that there actually are, the very possibility or impossibility of being is the first. Now, this possibility or this necessity forms or composes what we call the essences or natures and the truths we commonly call eternal—and we are right to call them so, for there is nothing so eternal as that which is necessary. Thus the nature of the circle with its properties is something existent and eternal. That is, there is a constant cause outside us which makes everyone who thinks carefully about the circle discover the same thing. It is not merely that their thoughts agree with each other, which could be attributed solely to the nature of the human mind, but even the phenomena or experiences confirm these eternal truths when the appearance of a circle strikes our senses. And these phenomena necessarily have some cause outside of us.
   
       <br>&emsp;But even though the existence of necessities is the first of all truths in and of itself and in the order of nature, I agree that it is not first in the order of our knowledge. For you see, in order to prove their existence I took it for granted that we think and that we have sensations. Thus there are two absolute general truths, that is, two absolute general truths which speak of the actual existence of things: the first, that we think, and the second, that there is a great variety in our thoughts. From the former it follows that we exist, and from the latter it follows that there is something else besides us, that is, something else besides that which thinks, something which is the cause of the variety of our appearances. Now one of these two truths is just as incontestable and as independent as the other; and Descartes, having accepted only the former, failed to arrive at the perfection to which he had aspired in the course of his meditations. If he had followed precisely what I call the thread of meditating [fdum meditandib I believe that he would have achieved the first philosophy. But not even the world's greatest genius can force things, and we must necessarily enter through the entryways that nature has made, so that we do not stray. Moreover, one person alone cannot do everything at once, and for myself, when I think of everything Descartes has said that is beautiful and original, I am more astonished with what he has accomplished than with what he has failed to accomplish. I admit that I have not yet been able to read all his writings with all the care I had intended to bring to them, and my friends know that, as it happened, I read almost all the new philosophers before reading him. Bacon and Gassendi were the first to fall into my hands; their familiar and easy style was better adapted to a person who wants to read everything. It is true that I often glanced at Galileo and Descartes, but since I became a geometer only recently, I was soon repelled by their manner of writing, which requires deep meditation. As for myself, although I always liked to meditate, I always found it difficult to read books that cannot be understood without much meditation. For, when following one's own meditations, one follows a certain natural inclination and gains profit along with pleasure; but one is enormously cramped when having to follow the meditations of others. I always liked books that contained some fine thoughts, but books that one could read without stopping, for they aroused ideas in me which I could follow at my fancy and pursue as I pleased. This also prevented me from reading geometry books with care, and I must admit that I have not yet brought myself to read Euclid in any other way than one commonly reads novels [histoires]. I have learned from experience that this method in general is a good one; but I have learned nevertheless that there are authors for whom one must make an exception—Plato and Aristotle among the ancient philosophers and Galileo and Descartes among ours. Yet what I know of Descartes's metaphysical and physical meditations is almost entirely derived from reading a number of books, written in a more familiar style, that report his opinions. So perhaps I have not yet understood him well. However, to the extent that I have leafed through his works myself, it seemed to me that I have glimpsed at very least what he has not accomplished and not even attempted to accomplish, that is, among other things, the analysis of all our assumptions. That is why I am inclined to applaud all those who examine the least truth to its deepest level; for I know that it is important to understand one perfectly, however small and however easy it may seem. This is the way to progress quite far and finally to establish the art of discovery which depends on a knowledge, but a most distinct and perfect knowledge of the easiest things. And for this reason I found nothing wrong in Roberval's attempt to demonstrate everything in geometry, including some axioms.' I admit that we should not demand such exactness from others, but I believe that it is good to demand it from ourselves.
   
       <br>&emsp;I return to those truths, from among those asserting that there is something outside us, which are first with respect to ourselves, namely, that we think and that there is a great variety in our thoughts. Now, this variety cannot come from that which thinks, since a single thing by itself cannot be the cause of the changes in itself. For everything would remain in the state in which it is, if there is nothing that changes it; and since it did not determine itself to have these changes rather than others, one cannot begin to attribute any variety to it without saying something which, we must admit, has no reason— which is absurd. And even if we tried to say that our thoughts had no beginning, beside the fact that we would be required to assert that each of us has existed from all eternity, we would still not escape the difficulty; for we would always have to admit that there is no reason for the particular variety which would have existed in our thoughts from all eternity, since there is nothing in us that determines us to have one kind of variety rather than to another. Therefore there is some cause outside of us for the variety of our thoughts. And since we conceive that there are subordinate causes for this variety, causes which themselves still need causes, we have established particular beings or substances certain of whose actions we recognize, that is, things from whose changes we conceive certain changes in us to follow. And we quickly proceed to construct what we call matter and body. But it is at this point that you are right to stop us a bit and renew the criticisms of the ancient Academy. For, at bottom, all our experience assures us of only two things, namely, that there is a connection among our appearances which provides us the means to predict future appearances with success, and that this connection must have a constant cause. But it does not strictly follow from all this that matter or bodies exist, but only that there is something that presents well- sequenced appearances to us. For if an invisible power took pleasure in giving us dreams that are well connected with our preceding life and in conformity among themselves, could we distinguish them from realities before having been awakened? And what prevents the course of our life from being a long well-ordered dream, a dream from which we could be wakened in a moment? And I do not see that this power would be imperfect on that account, as Descartes asserts, leaving aside the fact that it does not matter if it is imperfect. For this could be a certain subordinate power, or some genie who meddles in our affairs for some unknown reason and who has as much power over someone as had the caliph who transported a drunken man into his palace and made him taste of Mohammed's paradise when he had awakened; after this he was made drunk again and was returned to the place from which he had been taken. And when the man came to himself, he did not fail to interpret what to him appeared inconsistent with the course of his life as a vision, and spread among the people maxims and revelations that he believed he had learned in his pretended paradise—this was what the caliph wished. Now, since a reality passed for a vision, what prevents a vision from passing for a reality? It is true that the more we see some connection in what happens to us, the more we are confirmed in the opinion we have about the reality of our appearances; and it is also true that the more we examine our appearances closely, the more we find them well-sequenced, as microscopes and other aids in making experiments have shown us. This constant accord engenders great assurance, but after all, it will only be moral assurance until somebody discovers the a priori origin of the world we see and pursues the question as to why things are the way they appear back to the ground of essence. For having done that, he will have demonstrated that what appears to us is a reality and that it is impossible that we ever be deceived about it again. But I believe that this would nearly approach the beatific vision and that it is difficult to aspire to this in our present state. However, we would learn from this how confused the knowledge we commonly have of body and matter must be, since we believe we are certain they exist but in the end we discover that we can be mistaken. And this confirms Descartes's excellent proof of the distinction between body and soul, since we can doubt the former without being able to put the latter into question. For even if there were only appearances or dreams, we would be no less certain of the existence of that which thinks, as Descartes has said quite nicely. I add that the existence of God can be demonstrated in ways other than Descartes did, ways which, I believe, bring us farther along. For we do not need to assume a being who guarantees us against being deceived, since it is in our power to undeceive ourselves about many things, at least about the most important ones. I wish, sir, that your meditations on this have all the success you desire. But to accomplish this, it is good to proceed in order and to establish propositions; that is the way to gain ground and to make sure progress. I believe that you would oblige the public by conveying to it, from time to time, selections from the Academy and especially from Plato, for I recognize that there are things in there more beautiful and solid than commonly thought.

   There is an old saying that God made everything in accordance with weight, measure, and number. But there are things which cannot be weighed, namely, those that lack force and power [vis ac potential, and there are also things that lack parts and thus cannot be measured. But there is nothing that cannot be numbered. And so number is, as it were, metaphysical shape, and arithmetic is, in a certain sense, the Statics of the Universe, that by which the powers of things are investigated." 

   <br>&emsp;From the time of Pythagoras, people have been persuaded that enormous mysteries lie hidden in numbers. And it is plausible that Pythagoras brought this opinion into Greece from the Orient, as he did many other opinions. But since they lacked the true key to this secret, the more inquisitive slipped into futility and superstition. From this arose a certain sort of vulgar Cabbala (a Cabbala far distant from the true one), as did numerous absurdities connected to a certain falsely named magic, absurdities that fill books. Meanwhile, people have retained their inherent ability to believe that astonishing things can be discovered through numbers, characters, and through a certain new language that some people call the Adamic language, and Jacob & lime calls the "nature language" [die Natur-Sprache]. 

   <br>&emsp;But, as far as I know, no mortal until now has seen the true principle by which each thing can be assigned its own characteristic number. Indeed, the most learned persons have admitted that they did not understand what I was talking about when I casually mentioned something of this sort in their presence. Not long ago, some distinguished persons devised a certain language or Universal Characteristic in which all notions and things are nicely ordered, a language with whose help different nations can communicate their thoughts, and each, in its own language, read what the other wrote. But no one has put forward a language or characteristic which embodies, at the same time, both the art of discovery and the art of judgment, that is, a language whose marks or characters perform the same task as arithmetic marks do for numbers and algebraic marks do for magnitudes considered abstractly. And yet, when God bestowed these two sciences on the human race, it seems that he wanted to suggest to us that a much greater secret lies hidden in our intellect, a secret of which these two sciences are but shadows. 

   <br>&emsp;However, by some chance it happened that I fell upon such thoughts when still a boy, and as usually happens with such first inclinations, these thoughts, deeply imprinted, attached themselves to my mind ever after. Two things marvelously benefited me in this (things otherwise problematic, however, and often harmful to many): first, that I was nearly self-taught and, second, that I sought out what was new in each and every branch of knowledge, as soon as I came into contact with it, even though I often had not yet sufficiently grasped things commonly known. But these two things gave me an advantage; the first prevented me from filling my mind with trifles, things that ought to be forgotten, things that are accepted on the authority of teachers rather than because of arguments, and the second prevented me from resting before I probed all the way to the depths of each subject and arrived at its very principles, from which everything I extracted could be discovered by my own efforts. 

   <br>&emsp;Therefore, when I was led from reading histories (which wonderfully delighted me from my youth on) and from the concern with style (which I exercised in prose and the like with such ease that my teachers feared that I would be held back by its charms) to logic and philosophy, then as soon as I began to understand something of these matters, what a blessed multitude of these fantasies that arose in my brain did I scribble down on paper and show immediately to my amazed teachers. Among other things, I sometimes posed an objection concerning the predicaments. For, I said, just as there are of predicaments in which propositions themselves or complex terms might also be set out in a natural order; indeed, at that time I didn't even dream of including demonstrations, and I didn't know that geometers, who arrange propositions in accordance with which one is demonstrated from others, do what it is I sought to do. And so my objection was, indeed, empty. But since my teachers could not answer it, pursuing these thoughts on account of their novelty, I worked on constructing such predicaments for complex terms or propositions. When, through my eagerness for this project, I applied myself more intently, I inevitably stumbled onto this wonderful observation, namely, that one can devise a certain alphabet of human thoughts and that, through predicaments or classes of simple notions, so ought there to be a new genus the combination of the letters of this alphabet and through the analysis of words produced from them, all things can both be discovered and judged. I laying grasped this, I was quite overjoyed, indeed, with childlike delight, for at that time I hadn't sufficiently grasped the magnitude of the project. But afterwards, the more progress I made in understanding these matters, the more confirmed I was in my plan to follow out such a project. As it happened, when I was older, by now twenty years old, I was working on an academic exercise. And so I wrote a dissertation, On the Art of Combinations, published in the form of a little book in 1666, in which I presented this marvelous discovery to the public. It is, indeed, the sort of dissertation that a young man, freshly out of school, could have written, a young man not yet steeped in the real sciences, for mathematics was not cultivated in those parts, and, if I had spent my youth in Paris, as Pascal did, then perhaps I would have contributed to those sciences sooner. However, I am not sorry to have written this dissertation, for two reasons, first because it greatly pleased many very ingenious gentlemen and also because in it I already gave the world some hint of my discovery, so that now it won't seem as if I have just invented it for the first time. 

   <br>&emsp;Indeed, I often wondered why, as far as the recorded history of mankind extends, no mortal had approached such a project, for meditations of this kind ought to be among the first to occur to those reasoning in proper order, just as they occurred to me. I came to this discovery while still a youth, working on logic, before I had touched on morals or mathematics or physics, for the sole reason that I always searched for first principles. The real reason why people have missed the doorway [into this discovery] is, I think, because principles are, for the most part, dry and insufficiently agreeable to people, and so, barely tasted, they are dismissed. However, there are three men I am especially surprised did not approach the matter, Aristotle, Joachim Jungius, and Rene Descartes. For when Aristotle wrote his Organon and his Metaphysics, he examined the inner depth of notions with great skill. And while Joachim Jungius of Lubeck is a man little known even in Germany itself, he was clearly of such judiciousness and such capacity of mind that I know of no other mortal, including even Descartes himself, from whom we could better have expected a great restoration of the sciences, had Jungius been either known or assisted. Moreover, he was already of a mature age when Descartes began to flourish, so it is quite regrettable that they did not know one another." As far as Descartes goes, this is certainly not the place to praise a man who, due to the magnitude of his genius, is almost beyond praise. Certainly, he prepared the path through these ideas, a path that is true and straight, a path that leads up to this very point. But since his own path was directed too much toward applause, he seems to have broken off the thread of his investigation" and, overly eager, gave us his Metaphysical Meditations and a piece of his geometry, by which he captured people's attention. As for other subjects, he decided to investigate the nature of matter for the sake of medicine, and rightly so, had he but completed the task of ordering the ideas he had in mind, for then he would have shed more light by his experiments than anyone could believe. And so, the reason why he didn't apply his mind to this task can only be the fact that he had not sufficiently grasped the reason for pursuing such a program and its import. For if he had seen a way of establishing a rational philosophy as clear and unshakable as arithmetic, one can hardly believe that he would have used any other way for creating a sect, something he dearly wanted. For by the very nature of things, a sect using this sort of reasoning would immediately arise as soon as it exercised control over reason, as in geometry, and would not perish or weaken until the human race lost knowledge altogether through the invasion of some new barbarian horde. 

   <br>&emsp;Though distracted in so many other ways, I was absorbed in these meditations for the sole reason that I saw their great importance and saw a wonderfully easy way of attaining the goal. And indeed, by rigorous meditation I finally discovered the very thing I sought. And so now, nothing more is needed to construct the characteristic I am working on to the point where it is sufficient both to provide a grammar of such a wonderful language and a dictionary for most of the more frequent items, that is, to the point of having characteristic numbers for all ideas; I say, nothing more is needed than for the philosophical and mathematical curriculum [curses], as it is called, to be set up in accordance with a certain new method that I could set out. So conceived, the curriculum would contain nothing in itself either more difficult than other curricula or very far from what is ordinarily used and understood, or very foreign to common habits of writing. Nor does it require much more work than we see already expended on several curricula or encyclopedias, as they are called. I think that a few chosen persons could complete the task in five years; in two years they could set forth those doctrines most often used in daily life, that is, morals and metaphysics in an unshakable calculus. 

   <br>&emsp;Once the characteristic numbers of most notions are determined, the human race will have a new kind of tool, a tool that will increase the power of the mind much more than optical lenses helped our eyes, a tool that will be as far superior to microscopes or telescopes as reason is to vision. The compass never provided navigators with anything more useful than what this North Star would give us for swimming the sea of experiments. What other consequences will follow from this tool are in the hands of the fates, but they can only be great and good. For although people can be made worse off by all other gifts, correct reasoning alone can only be for the good. Moreover, who could doubt that reasoning will finally be correct, when it is everywhere as clear and certain as arithmetic has been up until now. And so that troublesome objection by which one antagonist now commonly harasses the other would be eliminated, an objection that turns many away from wanting to reason. What I have in mind is that, when someone offers a proof, his opponent doesn't examine the argument as much as he responds in general terms, how do you know that your reason is more correct than mine? What criterion of truth do you have? And even if the one antagonist appeals to his arguments, listeners lack the patience to examine them. For it is usually the case that many things must thoroughly be examined, a task taking several weeks, if we were carefully to follow the laws of reasoning accepted up until now. And so, after great agitation, emotions rather than reasons win most often, and we end the dispute by cutting the Gordian knot rather than untying it. This happens especially in deliberations pertaining to life, where something must be decided; here only a few people can weigh (as on a balance) the favorable and unfavorable factors, both of which are often numerous. And so, the better someone has learned to represent to himself more forcefully, here one, there another circumstance, following the various inclinations of his soul, or to ornament and paint them for others more eloquently and effectively, the more he will stir himself up and capture for himself the minds of men, especially if he is astute in using their emotions. There is scarcely anyone who can take account of both sides of the complete table of credits and debits, that is, who not only can enumerate the favorable and unfavorable factors, but can also weigh them correctly. And so two people who argue look to me almost like two merchants who owe money to one another from numerous transactions, but who never want to reckon up the accounts, while meanwhile each in different ways exaggerates what he himself is owed by the other and exaggerates the validity and size of certain particular claims. Thus, the controversy will never end. We should not be surprised that this happens in a large proportion of the controversies where the matter is unclear, that is, where the dispute cannot be reduced to numerical terms. But now our characteristic will reduce them all to numerical terms, so that even reasons can be weighed, just as if we had a special kind of balance. For even probabilities are subject to calculation and demonstration, since one can always judge what is more likely [probabilius] to happen on the basis of given circumstances. And, finally, anyone who has been persuaded of the certain truth of religion and, what follows from this, anyone who embraces others with such love that he hopes for the conversion of the human race will certainly admit, as soon as he understands these things, that nothing is more effective for the propagation of faith than this invention, except for miracles and the holiness of an Apostolic man or the victories of a great monarch. For wherever missionaries can once introduce this language, the true religion, the religion entirely in agreement with reason will be established and in the future apostasy will be feared no more than we fear that people will condemn arithmetic or geometry, once they have learned it. And so I repeat what I have often said, that a person who is neither prophet nor prince could undertake nothing better adapted to the good of the human race or to the glory of God. But we must go beyond words. Since, due to the wonderful interconnection of things, it is extremely difficult to produce the characteristic numbers of just a few things, considered apart from the others, I have contrived a device, quite elegant, if I am not mistaken, by which I can show that it is possible to corroborate reasoning through numbers. And so, I imagine that those so very wonderful characteristicstic numbers are already given, and, having observed a certain general property that characteristic numbers have, I meanwhile assume that these numbers I imagine, whatever they might be, have that property. By using these numbers I can immediately demonstrate through numbers, and in an amazing way, all of the logical rules and show how one can know whether certain arguments are in proper form. When we have the true characteristic numbers of things, then at last, without any mental effort or danger of error, we will be able to judge whether arguments are indeed materially sound and draw the right conclusions.

<div id="Meditations">

   Since controversies rage today among distinguished persons over true and false ideas and since this is an issue of great importance for recognizing truth, an issue on which Descartes himself is not altogether satisfactory, I would like to explain briefly what I think can be established about the distinctions and criteria that relate to ideas and knowledge [cognitio]. Thus, knowledge is either obscure or clear, and again, clear knowledge is either confused or distinct, and distinct knowledge either inadequate or adequate, and adequate knowledge either symbolic or intuitive: and, indeed, if knowledge were, at the same time, both adequate and intuitive, it would be absolutely perfect. 

   <br>&emsp;A notion which is not sufficient for recognizing the thing represented is obscure, as, for example, if whenever I remember some flower or animal I once saw, I cannot do so sufficiently well for me to recognize that flower or animal when presented and to distinguish it from other nearby flowers or animals, or, for example, if I were to consider some term insufficiently explained in the schools, like Aristotle's entelechy, or his notion of a cause insofar as it is something common to material, formal, efficient and final causes, or if I were to consider other terms of that sort, for which we have no settled definition. Whence, a proposition which involves such a notion is also obscure. Therefore, knowledge is clear when I have the means for recognizing the thing represented. Clear knowledge, again, is either confused or distinct. It is confused when I cannot enumerate one by one marks [now] sufficient for differentiating a thing from others, even though the thing does indeed have such marks and requisites into which its notion can be resolved. And so we recognize colors, smells, tastes, and other particular objects of the senses clearly enough, and we distinguish them from one another, but only through the simple testimony of the senses, not by way of explicit marks. Thus we cannot explain what red is to a blind man, nor can we make such things clear to others except by leading them into the presence of the thing and making them see, smell, or taste the same thing we do, or, at very least, by reminding them of some past perception that is similar. This is so even though it is certain that the notions of these qualities are composite and can be resolved because, of course, they do have causes. Similarly, we see that painters and other artists correctly know [cognosco] what is done properly and what is done poorly, though they are often unable to explain their judgments and reply to questioning by saying that the things that displease them lack an unknown something. But a distinct notion is like the notion an assayer has of gold, that is, a notion connected with marks and tests sufficient to distinguish a thing from all other similar bodies. Notions common to several senses, like the notions of number, magnitude, shape are usually of such a kind, as are those pertaining to many states of mind, such as hope or fear, in a word, those that pertain to everything for which we have a nominal definition (which is nothing but an enumeration of sufficient marks). Also, one has distinct knowledge of an indefinable notion, since it is primitive, or its own mark, that is, since it is irresolvable and is understood only through itself and therefore lacks requisites. But in composite notions, since, again, the individual marks composing them are sometimes understood clearly but confusedly, like heaviness, color, solubility in aqua fortis, and others, which are among the marks of gold, such knowledge of gold may be distinct, yet inadequate. When everything that enters into a distinct notion is, again, distinctly known, or when analysis has been carried to completion, then knowledge is adequate (I don't know whether humans can provide a perfect example of this, although the knowledge of numbers certainly approaches it). However, we don't usually grasp the entire nature of a thing all at once, especially in a more lengthy analysis, but in place of the things themselves we make use of signs, whose explicit explanation we usually omit for the sake of brevity, knowing or believing that we have the ability to produce it at will." And so when I think about a chiliagon, that is, a polygon with a thousand equal sides, I don't always consider the nature of a side, or of equality, or of thousandfoldedness (that is, of the cube of ten foldedness), but in my mind I use these words (whose sense appears only obscurely and imperfectly to the mind) in place of the ideas I have of these things, since I remember that I know the meaning of those words, and I decide that explanation is not necessary at this time. I usually call such thinking, which is found both in algebra and in arithmetic and, indeed, almost everywhere, blind or symbolic. And indeed, when a notion is very complex, we cannot consider all of its component notions at the same time. When we can, or indeed insofar as we can, I call knowledge intuitive. There is no knowledge of a distinct primitive notion except intuitive, just as our thinking about composites is for the most part symbolic. 

   <br>&emsp;From this it already follows that we don't perceive ideas of even those things we know distinctly, unless we make use of intuitive thinking. And, indeed, it happens that we often mistakenly believe that we have ideas of things in mind when we mistakenly suppose that we have already explained some of the terms we use. Furthermore, what some maintain, that we cannot say anything about a thing and understand what we say unless we have an idea of it, is either false or at least ambiguous. For, often, we do understand in one way or another the words in question individually or remember that we understood them previously. But since we are content with this blind thinking and don't pursue the resolution of notions far enough, it happens that a contradiction that might be included in a very complex notion is concealed from us. An argument for the existence of God, celebrated among the Scholastics long ago and revived by Descartes, once led me to consider this point more distinctly. The argument goes: whatever follows from the idea or definition of anything can be predicated of that thing. Since the most perfect being includes all perfections, among which is existence, existence follows from the idea of God (or the idea of the most perfect being, or the idea of that than which nothing greater can be thought). 5° Therefore existence can be predicated of God. But one must realize that from this argument we can conclude only that, if God is possible, then it follows that he exists. For we cannot safely use definitions for drawing conclusions unless we know first that they are real definitions, that is, that they include no contradictions, because we can draw contradictory conclusions from notions that include contradictions, which is absurd. To clarify this I usually use the example of the fastest motion, which entails an absurdity. For let us suppose some wheel turning with the fastest motion. Everyone can see that any spoke of the wheel extended beyond the edge would move faster than a nail on the rim of the wheel. Therefore the nail's motion is not the fastest, contrary to the hypothesis. However, at first glance we might seem to have the idea of a fastest motion, for we certainly understand what we say; but yet we certainly have no idea of impossible things. And so, in the same way, the fact that we think about a most perfect being is not sufficient for us to assert that we have an idea of it. And so, in the demonstration given a bit earlier, either we must show or we must assume the possibility of a most perfect being in order properly to draw the conclusion. However, nothing is truer than that we have an idea of God and that a most perfect being is possible, indeed, necessary; yet the argument is not sufficient for drawing the conclusion and was long ago rejected by Aquinas. 

   <br>&emsp;And so we also have a distinction between nominal definitions, which contain only marks of a thing to be distinguished from other things, and real definitions, from which one establishes that a thing is possible. And with this we give our due to Hobbes, who claimed that truths are arbitrary, since they depend on nominal definitions, without considering the fact that the reality of a definition is not a matter of decision and that not just any notions can be joined to one another. Nominal definitions are insufficient for perfect knowledge [scientia] except when one establishes in another way that the thing defined is possible. It is also obvious, at last, what true and false ideas are; namely, an idea is true when its notion is possible and false when it includes a contradiction. Moreover, we can know the possibility of a thing either a priori or a posteriori. The possibility of a thing is known a priori when we resolve a notion into its requisites, that is, into other notions known to be possible, and we know that there is nothing incompatible among them. This happens, among other cases, when we understand the way in which a thing can be produced, whence causal definitions are more useful than others. The possibility of a thing is known a posteriori when we know through experience that a thing actually exists, for what actually exists or existed is at very least possible. And, indeed, whenever we have adequate knowledge, we also have a priori knowledge of possibility, for having carried an analysis to completion, if no contradiction appears, then certainly the notion is at least possible. I won't now venture to determine whether people can ever produce a perfect analysis of their notions or whether they can ever reduce their thoughts to primitive possibilities or to irresolvable notions or (what comes to the same thing) to the absolute attributes of God, indeed to the first causes and the ultimate reason for things. For the most part we are content to have learned the reality of certain notions through experience, from which we then compose others following the example of nature. 

   <br>&emsp;From this I think that we can finally understand that one cannot always appeal safely to an idea and that many use this splendid honorific improperly to prop up certain creatures of their imagination, for we don't always have an idea corresponding to every thing we consciously think of, as I showed a while ago with the example of the greatest speed. Nor do I see that the people of our day have abused any less the principle that they have laid down, that whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive about a thing is true or is assertable of the thing in question. For, often, what is obscure and confused seems clear and distinct to people careless in judgment. Therefore, this axiom is useless unless we use criteria for the clear and distinct, criteria which we have made explicit, and unless we have established the truth of the ideas. Furthermore, the rules of common logic, which even the geometers use, are not to be despised as criteria for the truth of assertions, as, for example, the rule that nothing is to be admitted as certain, unless it is shown by careful testing or sound demonstration. Moreover, a sound demonstration is one that follows the form prescribed by logic. Not that we always need syllogisms ordered in the manner of the schools (in the way that Christian Herlinus and Conrad Dasypodius presented the first six books of Euclid); but at very least the argument must reach its conclusion by virtue of its form. Any correct calculation can also be considered an example of such an argument conceived in proper form. And so, one should not omit any necessary premise, and all premises should have been either previously demonstrated or at least assumed as hypotheses, in which case the conclusion is also hypothetical. Those who carefully observe these rules will easily protect themselves against deceptive ideas. Pascal, a most talented man, largely agrees with this in his excellent essay "On the Geometrical Mind" (a fragment of which appears in the admirable book of the distinguished Antoine Arnauld on the art of thinking well). The geometer, he says, must define all terms which are even a bit obscure and prove all truths which are even a bit dubious. But I wish that he had defined the limits beyond which a notion or statement is no longer even a bit obscure or dubious. Nevertheless, what belongs here can be gathered from an attentive consideration of what we have said above, for we are now trying to be brief.' 

   <br>&emsp;As to the controversy over whether we see everything in God (which is certainly an old opinion and should not be rejected completely, if it is understood properly) or whether we have our own ideas, one must understand that, even if we were to see everything in God, it would nevertheless be necessary that we also have our own ideas, that is, not little copies of God's, as it were, but affections or modifications of our mind corresponding to that very thing we perceived in God. For certainly there must be some change in our mind when we have some thoughts and then others, and, in fact, the ideas of things that we are not actually thinking about are in our mind as the shape of Hercules is in rough marble. Moreover, it is necessary not only that there actually be in God an idea of absolute and infinite extension but also that there be an idea of each shape, which is nothing but a modification of absolute extension. Furthermore, when we perceive colors or smells, we certainly have no perception other than that of shapes and of motions, though so very numerous and so very small that our mind cannot distinctly consider each individual one in this, its present state, and thus does not notice that its perception is composed of perceptions of minute shapes and motions alone, just as when we perceive the color green in a mixture of yellow and blue powder, we sense only yellow and blue finely mixed, even though we do not notice this, but rather fashion some new thing for ourselves. 

</div>
<div id="PrimaryTruths">

   The Primary Truths are those which assert the same thing of itself or deny the opposite of its opposite. For example, "A is A," "A is not not- A," or "if it is true that A is B, then it is false that A is not B or that A is not- B." Also "every thing is as it is," "every thing is similar or equal to itself," "nothing is greater or less than itself," and others of this sort. Although they themselves may have their degrees of priority, nonetheless they can all be included under the name 'identities.' 

   <br>&emsp;Moreover, all remaining truths are reduced to primary truths with the help of definitions, that is, through the resolution of notions; in this consists a priori proof, proof independent of experience. As an example, I shall give this proposition from among the axioms accepted equally by mathematicians and all others alike: "the whole is greater than its part," or "the part is less than the whole," something easily demonstrated from the definition of "less" or "greater," with the addition of the primitive axiom, that is, the axiom of identity. For the less is that which is equal to a part of the other (the greater), a definition easy to understand and in agreement with the practice of the human race, when people compare things with one another and, taking away from the greater something equal to the lesser, they find something that remains. Hence there is an argument of this sort: the part is equal to a part of the whole (it is, of course, equal to itself through the axiom of identity, that each and every thing is equal to itself), and what is equal to a part of a whole is less than the whole (from the definition of "less"). Therefore, the part is less than the whole. 

   <br>&emsp;Therefore, the predicate or consequent is always in the subject or antecedent, and the nature of truth in general or the connection between the terms of a statement, consists in this very thing, as Aristotle also observed. The connection and inclusion of the predicate in the subject is explicit in identities, but in all other propositions it is implicit and must be shown through the analysis of notions; a priori demonstration rests on this. 

   <br>&emsp;Moreover, this is true for every affirmative truth, universal or particular, necessary or contingent, and in both an intrinsic and extrinsic denomination. And here lies hidden a wonderful secret, a secret that contains the nature of contingency, that is, the essential difference between necessary and contingent truths, a secret that eliminates the difficulty concerning the fatal necessity of even those things that are free. 

   <br>&emsp;Many things of great importance follow from these considerations, considerations insufficiently attended to because of their obviousness. For the received axiom that nothing is without reason, or there is no effect without a cause, directly follows from these considerations; otherwise there would be a truth which could not be proved a priori, that is, a truth which could not be resolved into identities, contrary to the nature of truth, which is always an explicit or implicit identity. It also follows that, when in the givens everything on the one side is the same as it is on the other side, then everything will be the same in the unknowns, that is, in the consequents. This is because no reason can be given for any difference, a reason which certainly must derive from the givens. And a corollary of this, or better, an example, is Architnedes' postulate at the beginning of the book on statics, that, given equal weights on both sides of a balance with equal arms, everything is in equilibrium.' And hence there is even a reason for eternal things. If we imagine that the world has been from eternity, and we imagine only little balls in it, then we would have to explain why there are little balls rather than cubes. 

   <br>&emsp;From these considerations it also follows that, in nature, there cannot be two individual things that differ in number alone. For it certainly must be possible to explain why they are different, and that explanation must derive from some difference they contain. And so what St. Thomas recognized concerning separated intelligences, which, he said, never differ by number alone,' must also be said of other things, for never do we find two eggs or two leaves or two blades of grass in a garden that are perfectly similar. And thus, perfect similarity is found only in incomplete and abstract notions, where things are considered [in rations veniunt] only in a certain respect, but not in every way, as, for example, when we consider shapes alone, and neglect the matter that has shape. And so it is justifiable to consider two similar triangles in geometry, even though two perfectly similar material triangles are nowhere found. And although gold and other metals, also salts and many liquids might be taken to be homogeneous, this can only be admitted with regard to the senses, and it is not true that they are, in all rigor. 

   <br>&emsp;It also follows that there are no purely extrinsic denominations, denominations which have absolutely no foundation in the very thing denominated. For it is necessary that the notion of the subject denominated contain the notion of the predicate. And consequently, whenever the denomination of a thing is changed, there must be a variation in the thing itself. 

   <br>&emsp;The complete or perfect notion of an individual substance contains all of its predicates, past, present, and future. For certainly it is now true that a future predicate will be, and so it is contained in the notion of a thing. And thus everything that will happen to Peter or Judas, both necessary and free, is contained in the perfect individual notion of Peter or Judas, considered in the realm of possibility by withdrawing the mind from the divine decree for creating him, and is seen there by God. And from this it is obvious that God chose from an infinite number of possible individuals those he thought most in accord with the supreme and hidden ends of his wisdom. Properly speaking, he did not decide that Peter sin or that Judas be damned, but only that Peter who would sin with certainty, though not with necessity, but freely, and Judas who would suffer damnation would attain existence rather than other possible things; that is, he decreed that the possible notion become actual. And, although the future salvation of Peter is also contained in his eternal possible notion, it is, however, not without the concurrence of grace, for in the same perfect notion of that possible Peter, even the aid of divine grace to be given him is found, under the notion of possibility. 

   <br>&emsp;Every individual substance contains in its perfect notion the entire universe and everything that exists in it, past, present, and future. For there is no thing on which one cannot impose some true denomination from another thing, at very least a denomination of comparison and relation. Moreover, there is no purely extrinsic denomination. I have shown the same thing in many other ways, all in harmony with one another. 

   <br>&emsp;Indeed, all individual created substances are different expressions of the same universe and different expressions of the same universal cause, namely God. But the expressions vary in perfection, just as different representations or drawings of the same town from different points of view do. 

   <br>&emsp;Every individual created substance exerts physical action and passion on all the others. From a change made in one, some corresponding change follows in all the others, since the denomination is changed. And this is in agreement with our experience of nature. For, in a vessel filled with a liquid (and the whole universe is just such a vessel) motion made in the middle is propagated to the edges, although it is rendered more and more insensible, the more it recedes from its origin. 

   <br>&emsp;Strictly speaking, one can say that no created substance exerts a metaphysical action or influx on any other thing. For, not to mention the fact that one cannot explain how something can pass from one thing into the substance of another, we have already shown that from the notion of each and every thing follows all of its future states. What we call causes are only concurrent requisites, in metaphysical rigor. This is also illustrated by our experience of nature. For bodies really rebound from others through the force of their own elasticity, and not through the force of other things, even if another body is required in order for the elasticity (which arises from something intrinsic to the body itself) to be able to act. 

   <br>&emsp;Also, assuming the distinction between soul and body, from this we can explain their union without the common hypothesis of an influx, which is unintelligible, and without the hypothesis of an occasional cause, which appeals to a Deus ex machina. For God from the beginning constituted both the soul and the body with such wisdom and such workmanship that, from the first constitution or notion of a thing, everything that happens through itself [per se] in the one corresponds perfectly to everything that happens in the other, just as if something passed from one to the other. This is what I call the hypothesis of concomitance. This hypothesis is true in all substances in the whole universe but cannot be sensed in all of them, unlike the case of the soul and the body. 

   <br>&emsp;There is no vacuum. For the different parts of empty space would then be perfectly similar and mutually congruent and could not be distinguished from one another. And so they would differ in number alone, which is absurd. One can also prove that time is not a thing in the same way as we did for space. 

   <br>&emsp;There is no atom, indeed, there is no body so small that it is not actually subdivided. Because of that, while it is acted upon by everything else in the whole universe and receives some effect from everything (an effect which must cause change in a body), it also preserves all past impressions and contains, before they happen, all future impressions. And if anyone were to say that that effect is contained in the motions impressed on the atom, which receives the effect as a whole without being divided, one can respond that not only must there be effects produced in an atom from all the impressions of the universe, but also, in turn, the state of the whole universe must be inferred from the atom, from the effect, the cause. But since the same motion can come about through different impressions, through no regress can one infer the impressions by means of which it [i.e., the atom] had come to its present state, from the shape and motion of an atom alone—not to mention the fact that one cannot explain why bodies of a certain smallness cannot be divided further. 

   <br>&emsp;From this it follows that every particle of the universe contains a world of an infinity of creatures. However, the continuum is not divided into points, nor is it divided in all possible ways—not into points, since points are not parts but boundaries, and not in all possible ways, since not all creatures are in a given thing, but there is only a certain progression of them ad infinitum, just as one who assumes a straight line and any part derived by bisection sets up divisions different from someone who trisects it. 

   <br>&emsp;There is no determinate shape in actual things, for none can be appropriate for an infinite number of impressions. And so neither a circle, nor an ellipse, nor any other line we can define exists except in the intellect, nor do lines exist before they are drawn, nor parts before they are separated off." 

   <br>&emsp;Extension and motion, as well as bodies themselves (insofar as only motion and extension are placed in bodies) are not substances, but true phenomena, like rainbows and parhelia. For there are no shapes in things, and if we consider their extension alone, then bodies are not substances, but many substances. 

   <br>&emsp;Something lacking extension is required for the substance of bodies; otherwise, there would be no source [principium] for the reality of phenomena or for true unity. There is always a plurality of bodies, and never one, and therefore, in reality, there is not even a plurality. Cordemoy proved atoms using a similar argument. But since atoms are excluded, what remains is something lacking extension, analogous to the soul, which they once called form or species. 

   <br>&emsp;Corporeal substance can neither arise nor perish except through creation or annihilation. For when corporeal substance once endures, it will always endure, since there is no reason for any difference, and the dissolution of parts of a body has nothing in common with its destruction. Therefore, animate 

   <br>&emsp;things neither arise nor perish, but are only transformed.

<div id="ANewSystem">

   A few years have already passed since I conceived this system and communicated with some learned men about it, especially with one of the greatest theologians and philosophers of our time, who had learned about some of my opinions through a person of the highest nobility, and had found them extremely paradoxical. But having received my explanations, he changed his attitude in the most generous and edifying way possible; and, having approved some of my propositions, he withdrew his censure regarding the others, with which he still disagreed. Since that time I have continued my meditations, as circumstances allow, so as to give the public only well-examined opinions; I have also tried to satisfy objections raised against my essays on dynamics, which are connected with this system. rn Finally, since some important persons have desired to see my opinions further clarified, I have risked publishing these meditations, even though they are not at all popular, nor can they be appreciated by all sorts of minds. I have decided upon this mainly to profit from the judgments of persons enlightened in these matters, since it would be too troublesome to seek out and call individually upon all those who would be disposed to give me instruction—which I shall always be glad to receive, provided that it contains the love of truth, rather than a passion for preconceived opinions. 

   <br>&emsp;Although I am someone who has done much work on mathematics, I have continued to meditate on philosophy since my youth, for it always seemed to me that one can establish something solid there through clear demonstrations. I had penetrated far into the territory of the Scholastics, when mathematics and the modern authors made me withdraw from it, while I was still young. I was charmed by their beautiful ways of explaining nature mechanically, and I rightly despised the method of those who use only forms or faculties, from which one can learn nothing. But since then, having attempted to examine the very principles of mechanics in order to explain the laws of nature we learn from experience, I perceived that considering extended mass alone was not sufficient, and that it was necessary, in addition, to make use of the notion of force, which is very intelligible, despite the fact that it belongs in the domain of metaphysics. It also seemed to me that although the opinion of those who transform or degrade animals into pure machines may be possible, it is improbable, and even contrary to the order of things. 

   <br>&emsp;In the beginning, when I had freed myself from the yoke of Aristotle, I accepted the void and atoms, for they best satisfy the imagination. But on recovering from that, after much reflection, I perceived that it is impossible to find the principles of a true unity in matter alone, or in what is only passive, since everything in it is only a collection or aggregation of parts to infinity. Now, a multitude can derive its reality only from true unities, which have some other origin and are considerably different from [[mathematical]] points [[which are only the extremities and modifications of extension,]] which all agree cannot make up the continuum. Therefore, in order to find these real entities I was forced to have recourse to a formal atom, since a material thing cannot be both material and, at the same time, perfectly indivisible, that is, endowed with a true unity. I93 Hence, it was necessary to restore, and, as it were, to rehabilitate the substantial forms which are in such disrepute today, but in a way that would render them intelligible, and separate the use one should make of them from the abuse that has been made of them. I found then that their nature consists in force, and that from this there follows something analogous to sensation and appetite, so that we must conceive of them on the model of the notion we have of souls. But just as soul must not be used to explain the particular details of the economy of the animal's body, I judged that we must not use these forms to explain the particular problems of nature, even though they are necessary to establish the true general principles. Aristotle calls them first entelechies; I call them, perhaps more intelligibly, 

   <br>&emsp;primitive forces, which contain not only act or the completion of possibility, but also an original activity. 

   <br>&emsp;I saw that these forms and souls must be indivisible, as our mind is; I remembered that this was Saint Thomas's view on the souls of animals.'" But this truth revived the great difficulties about the origin and duration of souls and forms. For, since every [[simple]] substance which has a true unity can begin and end only by miracle, it follows that they can begin only by creation and end only by annihilation. Thus I was forced to recognize that, except for the souls that God wishes to create expressly, the forms constitutive of substances must have been created together with the world, and must always subsist. Moreover, certain Scholastics, like Albertus Magnus and John Bacon,'" glimpsed a part of the truth about the origin of these forms. This should not appear extraordinary, since we ascribe to forms only duration, which the Gassendists grant their atoms. 

   <br>&emsp;I judged, however, that we must not indiscriminately confuse minds or rational souls [[with other forms or souls]], for they are of a higher order, and have incomparably greater perfection than the forms thrust into matter [[(which, in my view, are found everywhere)]], minds being like little gods in comparison with them, made in the image of God, and having in them some ray of the light of divinity. That is why God governs minds as a prince governs his subjects, and even as a father cares for his children, whereas he disposes of other substances as an engineer handles his machines. Thus minds have particular laws, which place them above the upheavals [revolutions] in matter, [[through the very order which God has put in them]]; and we can say that everything else is made only for them, and that these tumultuous motions themselves are adjusted for the happiness of the good and the punishment of the wicked. 

   <br>&emsp;However, returning to ordinary forms, or to material souls,'" the duration that we must attribute to them, in place of the duration that had been attributed to atoms, might make us suspect that they pass from body to body—which would be metempsychosis—somewhat as some philosophers have believed in the transmission of motion and species. But this fancy is far removed from the nature of things. There is no such passage; this is where the transformations of Swammerdam, Malpighi, and Leeuwenhoek, the best observers of our time, have come to my aid, and have made it easier for me to admit that animals and all other organized substances have no beginning, although we think they do, and that their apparent generation is only a development, a kind of augmentation. I have also noticed that the author of the Search after Truth, Regis, Hartsoeker and other able persons have held opinions not far removed from this. 

   <br>&emsp;But the greatest question still remained: what becomes of these souls or forms at the death of the animal or at the destruction of the individual organized substance? This question is most perplexing, since it hardly seems reasonable that souls should remain uselessly in a chaos of confused matter.This made me judge that there is only one reasonable view to take—namely, the conservation not only of the soul, but also of the animal itself and its organic machine, even though the destruction of its larger parts reduces it to a smallness which escapes our senses, just as it was before its birth. Moreover, no one can specify the true time of death, which for a long time may pass for a simple suspension of noticeable actions, and is basically never anything else in simple animals—witness the resuscitations of drowned flies buried under pulverized chalk, and several other similar examples which are sufficient to show that there would be many other resuscitations, and greater ones, if men were in a position to restore the machine. This may be similar to something the great Democritus discussed, complete atomist that he was, though Pliny made fun of him.'" It is therefore natural that an animal, having always been alive and organized (as some persons of great insight are beginning to recognize), always remains so. And since there is no first birth or entirely new generation of an animal, it follows that there will not be any final extinction or complete death, in a strict metaphysical sense. Consequently, instead of the transmigration of souls, there is only a transformation of the same animal, according to whether its organs are differently enfolded and more or less developed. 

   <br>&emsp;However, rational souls follow much higher laws, and are exempt from anything that might make them lose the quality of being citizens of the society of minds; God has provided so well that no changes of matter can make them lose the moral qualities of their personhood. And we can say that everything tends not only toward the perfection of the universe in general, but also toward the perfection of these creatures in particular, creatures who are destined for such a degree of happiness that the universe finds itself benefited by virtue of the divine goodness that is communicated to each, to the extent that supreme wisdom can allow. 

   <br>&emsp;With respect to ordinary animal bodies and other corporeal substances, whose complete extinction has been accepted until now, and whose changes depend on mechanical rules rather than moral laws, I noted with pleasure that the ancient author of the book De diaeta, attributed to Hippocrates,'" had glimpsed something of the truth when he stated explicitly that animals are not born and do not die, and that things we believe to begin and perish merely appear and disappear. This was also the opinion of Parmenides and Melissus, according to Aristotle.'" For these ancients were much more solid than people believe. 

   <br>&emsp;I am the most readily disposed person to do justice to the moderns, yet I find that they have carried reform too far, among other things, by confusing natural things with artificial things, because they have lacked sufficiently grand ideas of the majesty of nature. They think that the difference between natural machines and ours is only the difference between great and small. Recently this led a very able man, the author of the Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds, to assert that when we examine nature more closely we find it less admirable than previously thought and more like the workshop of a craftsman. I believe that this conception does not give us a sufficiently just or worthy idea of nature, and that my system alone allows us to understand the true and immense distance between the least productions and mechanisms of divine wisdom and the greatest masterpieces that derive from the craft of a limited mind; this difference is not simply a difference of degree, but a difference of kind. We must then know that the machines of nature have a truly infinite number of organs, and are so well supplied and so resistant to all accidents that it is not possible to destroy them. A natural machine still remains a machine in its least parts, and moreover, it always remains the same machine that it has been, being merely transformed through the different enfolding it undergoes, sometimes extended, sometimes compressed and concentrated, as it were, when it is thought to have perished. 

   <br>&emsp;In addition, by means of the soul or form there is a true unity corresponding to what is called the self [moy] in us. Such a unity could not occur in the machines made by a craftsman or in a simple mass of matter, however organized it may be; such a mass can only be considered as an army or a herd, or a pond full of fish, or like a watch composed of springs and wheels. Yet if there were no true substantial unities, there would be nothing substantial or real in the collection. That was what forced Cordemoy to abandon Descartes and to embrace the Democritean doctrine of atoms in order to find a true unity. But atoms of matter are contrary to reason. Furthermore, they are still composed of parts, since the invincible attachment of one part to another (if we can reasonably conceive or assume this) would not eliminate diversity of those parts. There are only atoms of substance, that is, real unities absolutely destitute of parts, which are the source of actions, the first absolute principles of the composition of things, and, as it were, the final elements in the analysis of substantial things. We could call them thing vital, a kind of perception, and mathematical points are the points of view metaphysical points: they have some- from which they express the universe. But when corporeal substances are contracted, all their organs together constitute only a physical point relative to us. Thus physical points are indivisible only in appearance; mathematical points are exact, but they are merely modalities. Only metaphysical points or points of substance (constituted by forms or souls) are exact and real, and without them there would be nothing real, since without true unities there would be no multitude. 

   <br>&emsp;After I established these things, I thought I was entering port; but when I began to meditate about the union of soul and body, I felt as if I were thrown again into the open sea. For I could not find any way of explaining how the body makes anything happen in the soul, or vice versa, or how one substance can communicate with another created substance. Descartes had given up the game at this point, as far as we can determine from his writings. But his disciples, seeing that the common opinion is inconceivable, judged that we sense the qualities of bodies because God causes thoughts to arise in the soul on the occasion of motions of matter, and that when our soul, in turn, wishes to move the body, it is God who moves the body for it. And since the communication of motions also seemed inconceivable to them, they believed that God imparts motion to a body on the occasion of the motion of another body. That is what they call the system of occasional causes, which has been made very fashionable by the beautiful reflections of the author of the search after truth. 

   <br>&emsp;I must admit that they have penetrated the difficulty by articulating what could not possibly be the case, but their explanation of what actually happens does not appear to eliminate the difficulty. It is quite true that, speaking with metaphysical rigor, there is no real influence of one created substance on another, and that all things, with all their reality, are continually produced by the power [vertu] of God. But in solving problems it is not sufficient to make use of the general cause and to invoke what is called a Deus ex machina. For when one does that without giving any other explanation derived from the order of secondary causes, it is, properly speaking, having recourse to miracle. In philosophy we must try to give reasons by showing how things are brought about by divine wisdom, but in conformity with the notion of the subject in question. 

   <br>&emsp;Therefore, since I was forced to agree that it is not possible for the soul or any other true substance to receive something from without, except by divine omnipotence, I was led, little by little, to a view that surprised me, but which seems inevitable, and which, in fact, has very great advantages and rather considerable beauty. That is, we must say that God originally created the soul (and any other real unity) in such a way that everything must arise for it from its own depths [fonds], through a perfect spontaneity relative to itself, and yet with a perfect conformity relative to external things. And thus, since our internal sensations (meaning those in the soul itself, and not those in the brain or in other subtile parts of the body) are merely phenomena which follow upon external beings, or better, they are true appearances and like well- ordered dreams, these internal perceptions in the soul itself must arise because of its own original constitution, that is, they must arise through the representative nature (capable of expressing external things as they relate to its organs) given to the soul from its creation, which constitutes its individual character. This is what makes every substance represent the whole universe exactly and in its own way, from a certain point of view, and makes the perceptions or expressions of external things occur in the soul at a given time, in virtue of its own laws, as if in a world apart, and as if there existed only God and itself (to make use of the manner of speaking used by a certain person of great spiritual elevation whose piety is renowned). There will be a perfect agreement among all these substances, producing the same effect that would be noticed if they communicated through the transmission of species or qualities, as the common philosophers imagine they do. In addition, the organized mass, in which the point of view of the soul lies, being expressed more closely by the soul, is in turn ready to act by itself, following the laws of the corporeal machine, at the moment when the soul wills it to act, without disturbing the laws of the other—the spirits and blood then having exactly the motions that they need to respond to the passions and perceptions of the soul. It is this mutual relation, regulated in advance in each substance of the universe, which produces what we call their communication, and which alone brings about the union of soul and body. We can thus understand how the soul has its seat in the body by an immediate presence which could not be greater, since the soul is in the body as unity is in the resultant of unities, which is a multitude. 

   <br>&emsp;This hypothesis is entirely possible. For why should God be unable to give substance, from the beginning, a nature or an internal force that can produce in it, in an orderly way (as would happen in a spiritual or formal automaton, but free to it, that is, all the appearances or expressions it will have, without the help of any created being? This is especially so since the nature of substance necessarily requires and essentially involves progress or change, without which it would not have the force to act. And since this nature that pertains to the soul is representative of the universe in a very exact manner (though more or less distinctly), the series of representations produced by the soul will correspond naturally to the series of changes in the universe itself, just as the body, in turn, has also been accommodated to the soul for the situations in which the soul is thought to act externally. This is all the more reasonable insofar as bodies are made only for minds capable of entering into community with God and celebrating his glory. Thus, once we see the possibility of this hypothesis of agreements, we also see that it is the most reasonable hypothesis, and that it gives us a marvelous idea of the harmony of the universe and the perfection of the works of God. 

   <br>&emsp;It also has this great advantage, that instead of saying that we are free only in appearance and in a way sufficient for practical purposes, as several intelligent persons have believed, we should rather say that we are determined only in appearance, and that, in rigorously metaphysical language, we have a perfect independence relative to the influence of every other creature. This also throws a marvelous light on the immortality of our soul and the always uniform conservation of our individual being, which is perfectly well regulated by its own nature and protected from all external accidents, appearances to the contrary notwithstanding. Never has any system made our eminence more evident. Since every mind is like a world apart, self-sufficient, independent of any other creature, containing infinity, and expressing the universe, it is as durable, subsistent, and absolute as the universe of creatures 

   <br>&emsp;in the case where it has a share of reason), everything that will happen itself. Thus we should judge that it must always behave in the way most proper to contribute to the perfection of the society of all minds, which is their moral union in the City of God. There is also a new proof for the existence of God in our system, one which has extraordinary clarity. For the perfect agreement of so many substances which have no communication among them can only come from the common source. 

   <br>&emsp;Besides all the advantages that recommend this hypothesis, we can say that it is something more than a hypothesis, since it hardly seems possible to explain things in any other intelligible way, and since several serious difficulties ties which, until now, have troubled minds, seem to disappear by themselves when we properly understand the system. Ordinary ways of speaking are also preserved. For we can say that the substance, whose disposition accounts for change intelligibly, in the sense that we may judge that the other substances have been accommodated to this one in this regard from the beginning, according to the order of God's decree, is the substance we must consequently conceive as acting upon the others. Furthermore, the action of one substance on another is neither the emission nor the transplanting of an entity, as commonly conceived, and can reasonably be taken only in the manner just stated. It is true that we readily conceive emissions and receptions of parts in matter, by which we can reasonably explain all the phenomena of physics mechanically. But since material mass is not a substance, it is clear that action with respect to substance itself can only be as I have just described. 

   <br>&emsp;These considerations, however metaphysical they may seem, have yet another marvelous use in physics, in order to establish the laws of motion, as our Dynamics will be able to show. For we can say that in the impact of bodies, each body suffers only through its own elasticity, caused by the motion already in it. And as for absolute motion, nothing can fix it with mathematical rigor, since everything terminates in relations. This makes for the perfect equivalence of hypotheses, as in astronomy, so that no matter how many bodies we take, we may arbitrarily assign rest or a particular degree of speed to any body we choose, without being refuted by the phenomena of rectilinear, circular, or composite motion. However, it is reasonable to attribute some true motions to bodies, in accordance with the assumption that accounts for the phenomena in the most intelligible way, this denomination being in conformity with the notion of action we have just established.'"

<div id="UltimateOriginationThings">

   Beyond the world, that is, beyond the collection of finite things, there is some One Being who rules, not only as the soul is the ruler in me, or, better, as the self is the ruler in my body, but also in a much higher sense. For the One Being who rules the universe not only rules the world, but also fashions or creates it; he is above the world, and, so to speak, extramundane, and therefore he is the ultimate reason for things. For we cannot find in any of the individual things, or even in the entire collection and series of things, a sufficient reason for why they exist. Let us suppose that a book on the elements of geometry has always existed, one copy always made from another. It is obvious that although we can explain a present copy of the book from the previous book from which it was copied, this will never lead us to a complete explanation, no matter how many books back we go, since we can always wonder why there have always been such books, why these books were written, and why they were written the way they were. What is true of these books is also true of the different states of the world, for the state which follows is, in a sense, copied from the preceding state, though in accordance with certain laws of change. And so, however far back we might go into previous states, we will never find in those states a complete explanation [ratio] for why, indeed, there is any world at all, and why it is the way it is. 

   <br>&emsp;I certainly grant that you can imagine that the world is eternal. However, since you assume only a succession of states, and since no reason for the world can be found in any one of them whatsoever (indeed, assuming as many of them as you like won't in any way help you to find a reason), it is obvious that the reason must be found elsewhere. For in eternal things, even if there is no cause, we must still understand there to be a reason. In things that persist, the reason is the nature or essence itself, and in a series of changeable things (if, a priori, we imagine it to be eternal), the reason would be the superior strength of certain inclinations, as we shall soon see, where the reasons don't necessitate (with absolute or metaphysical necessity, where the contrary implies a contradiction) but incline. From this it follows that even if we assume the eternity of the world, we cannot escape the ultimate and extramundane reason for things, God. 

   <br>&emsp;Therefore, the reasons for the world lie hidden in something extramundane, different from the chain of states, or from the series of things, the collection of which constitutes the world. And so we must pass from physical or hypothetical necessity, which determines the later things in the world from the earlier, to something which is of absolute or metaphysical necessity, something for which a reason cannot be given. For the present world is physically or hypothetically necessary, but not absolutely or metaphysically necessary. That is, given that it was once such and such, it follows that such and such things will arise in the future. Therefore, since the ultimate ground must be in something which is of metaphysical necessity, and since the reason for an existing thing must come from something that actually exists, it follows that there must exist some one entity of metaphysical necessity, that is, there must be an entity whose essence is existence, and therefore something must exist which differs from the plurality of things, which differs from the world, which we have granted and shown is not of metaphysical necessity. 

   <br>&emsp;Furthermore, in order to explain a bit more distinctly how temporal, contingent, or physical truths arise from eternal, essential or metaphysical truths, we must first acknowledge that since something rather than nothing exists, there is a certain urge for existence or (so to speak) a straining toward existence in possible things or in possibility or essence itself; in a word, essence in and of itself strives for existence. Futhermore, it follows from this that all possibles, that is, everything that expresses essence or possible reality, strive with equal right for existence in proportion to the amount of essence or reality or the degree of perfection they contain, for perfection is nothing but the amount of essence. 

   <br>&emsp;From this it is obvious that of the infinite combinations of possibilities and possible series, the one that exists is the one through which the most essence or possibility is brought into existence. In practical affairs one always follows the decision rule in accordance with which one ought to seek the maximum or the minimum: namely, one prefers the maximum effect at the minimum cost, so to speak. And in this context, time, place, or in a word, the receptivity or capacity of the world can be taken for the cost or the plot of ground on which the most pleasing building possible is to be built, and the variety of shapes [therein] [formarum ... varietates] corresponds to the pleasingness of the building and the number and elegance of the rooms. And the situation is like that in certain games, in which all places on the board are supposed to be filled in accordance with certain rules, where at the end, blocked by certain spaces, you will be forced to leave more places empty than you could have or wanted to, unless you used some trick. There is, however, a certain procedure through which one can most easily fill the board. Thus, if, for example, we suppose that we are directed to construct a triangle, without being given any other directions, the result is that an equilateral triangle would be drawn; and if we suppose that we are to go from one point to another, without being directed to use a particular path, the path chosen will be the easiest or the shortest one. And so, assuming that at some time being is to prevail over nonbeing, or that there is a reason why something rather than nothing is to exist, or that something is to pass from possibility to actuality, although nothing beyond this is determined, it follows that there would be as much as there possibly can be, given the capacity of time and space (that is, the capacity of the order of possible existence); in a word, it is just like tiles laid down so as to contain as many as possible in a given area. 

   <br>&emsp;From this we can already understand in a wondrous way how a certain Divine Mathematics or Metaphysical Mechanism is used in the very origination of things, and how the determination of a maximum finds a place. The case is like that in geometry, where the straight angle is distinguished from all angles, or like the case of a liquid placed in another of a different kind, which forms itself into the most capacious shape, namely that of a sphere, or best of all, like the case in common mechanics where the struggling of many heavy bodies with one another finally gives rise to a motion through which there results the greatest descent, taken as a whole. For just as all possibles strive with equal right for existence in proportion to their reality, so too all heavy things strive with equal right to descend in proportion to their heaviness, and just as the one case results in the motion which contains as much descent of heavy things as is possible, the other case gives rise to a world in which the greatest number of possibles is produced. 

   <br>&emsp;And so, we now have physical necessity derived from metaphysics. For even if the world is not metaphysically necessary, in the sense that its contrary implies a contradiction or a logical absurdity, it is, however, physically necessary or determined, in the sense that its contrary implies imperfection or moral absurdity. And just as possibility is the foundation [principium] of essence, so perfection or degree of essence (through which the greatest number of things are compossible) is the foundation of existence. From this it is at the same time obvious how the Author of the World can be free, even though everything happens determinately, since he acts from a principle of wisdom or perfection. Indeed, indifference arises from ignorance, and the wiser one is, the more one is determined to do that which is most perfect. 

   <br>&emsp;But, you say, this comparison between a certain determining metaphysical mechanism and the physical mechanism of heavy bodies, though it seems elegant, is faulty insofar as the heavy bodies striving really exist, while possibilities or essences before, or rather outside of existence, are imaginary or fictional, and therefore, one cannot seek a reason for existence in them. I respond that neither those essences nor the so-called eternal truths pertaining to them are fictitious. Rather, they exist in a certain realm of ideas, so to speak, namely, in God himself, the source of every essence and of the existence of the rest. The very existence of the actual series of things shows that we seem not to have spoken without grounds. For the reason for things must be sought in metaphysical necessities or in eternal truths, since (as I showed above) it cannot be found in the actual series of things. But existing things cannot derive from anything but existing things, as I already noted above. So it is necessary that eternal truths have their existence in a certain absolute or metaphysically necessary subject, that is, in God, through whom those things which would otherwise be imaginary are realized, to use a barbaric but graphic expression.'" 

   <br>&emsp;And indeed, we observe that everything in the world takes place in accordance with laws that are eternally true, laws that are not merely geometrical, but also metaphysical, that is, not only in accordance with material necessities, but also in accordance with formal reasons. This is true not only in very general terms, in the explanation [ratio] we have just now given for why the world exists rather than not, and why it exists this way rather than some other way (which is certainly to be sought in the striving of possibles for existence), but in descending to particulars we also see the wonderful way in which metaphysical laws of cause, power and action, have their place in the whole of nature, and we see that these metaphysical laws prevail over the purely geometrical laws of matter. As I found to my great astonishment in explaining the laws of motion, this is true to such an extent that I was finally forced to abandon the law of the geometrical composition of conatus, which I once defended in my youth, when I was more materialistic, as I have explained at greater length elsewhere. 

   <br>&emsp;And so, the ultimate reason for the reality of both essences and existences lies in one thing, which must of necessity be greater than the world, higher than the world, and must have existed before the world did, since through it not only existing things, which make up the world, but also possibles have their reality. Moreover, it can be sought in but one source, because of the interconnection among all of these things. Furthermore, it is obvious that, from this source, things are continually flowing forth, are being produced and were produced, since it is not clear why one state of the world any more than another, yesterday's any more than today's, should flow from it. It is also obvious how God acts not only physically, but freely, how in him there is not only the efficient cause of things, but the final cause, and how in him we have not only the reason for the greatness or power in the mechanism of the universe as now constituted, but also the reason for the goodness or wisdom in constituting it. 

   <br>&emsp;And lest anyone think that I am here confusing moral perfection or goodness with metaphysical perfection or greatness, and grant the latter while denying the former, one must realize that it follows from what I have said that not only is the world physically (or, if you prefer, metaphysically) most perfect, that is, that the series of things which has been brought forth is the one in which there is, in actuality, the greatest amount of reality, but it also follows that the world is morally most perfect, since moral perfection is in reality physical perfection with respect to minds. From this it follows that the world is not only the most admirable machine, but insofar as it is made up of minds, it is also the best republic, the republic through which minds derive the greatest possible happiness and joy, in which their physical perfection consists. 

   <br>&emsp;But, you ask, don't we experience quite the opposite in the world? For the worst often happens to the best, and not only innocent beasts but also humans are injured and killed, even tortured. In the end, the world appears to be a certain confused chaos rather than a thing ordered by some supreme wisdom, especially if one takes note of the conduct of the human race. I confess that it appears this way at first glance, but a deeper look at things forces us to quite the contrary view. From those very considerations which I brought forward it is obvious a priori that everything, even minds, is of the highest perfection there can be. 

   <br>&emsp;And indeed, it is unjust to make a judgment unless one has examined the entire law, as lawyers say. We know but a small part of the eternity which extends without measure, for how short is the memory of several thousand years which history gives us. But yet, from such meager experience we rashly make judgments about the immense and the eternal, like people born and raised in prison or, if you prefer, in the subterranean saltmines of the Sarmatians, people who think that there is no light in the world but the dim light of their torches, light scarcely sufficient to guide their steps. Look at a very beautiful picture, and cover it up except for some small part. What will it look like but some confused combination of colors, without delight, without art; indeed the more closely we examine it the more it will look that way. But as soon as the covering is removed, and you see the whole surface from an appropriate place, you will understand that what looked like accidental splotches on the canvas were made with consummate skill by the creator of the work. What the eyes discover in the painting, the ears discover in music. Indeed, the most distinguished masters of composition quite often mix dissonances with consonances in order to arouse the listener, and pierce him, as it were, so that, anxious about what is to happen, the listener might feel all the more pleasure when order is soon restored, just as we delight in small dangers or in the experience of misfortune for the very feeling or manifestation they provide of our power or happiness, or just as we delight in the spectacle of ropewalkers or sword dancing for their very ability to incite fear, or just as we ourselves laughingly half toss children, as if we are about to throw them off. (It was also for this reason that when Christian, King of Denmark, was still an infant, wrapped in swaddling clothes, an ape carried him to the edge of the roof, and then, while all were in distress, the ape, almost as if he were laughing, put him safely back into the cradle.) On that same principle it is insipid to always eat sweet things; sharp, acidic, and even bitter tastes should be mixed in to stimulate the palate. He who hasn't tasted bitter things hasn't earned sweet things, nor, indeed, will he appreciate them. Pleasure does not derive from uniformity, for uniformity brings forth disgust and makes us dull, not happy: this very principle is a law of delight. 

   <br>&emsp;But what we said about the part, which can be disordered without detracting from the harmony of the whole, should not be taken to mean that there is no reason for the parts, or that it would be (as it were) sufficient for the world as a whole to be perfect of its kind, even if the human race were miserable, and no attention paid to justice in the universe, or no provision made for us, as certain persons of poor judgment believe about the totality of things.' For one must realize that just as in the best constituted republic, care is taken that each individual gets what is good for him, as much as possible, similarly, the universe would be insufficiently perfect unless it took individuals into account as much as could be done consistently with preserving the harmony of the universe. It is impossible in this matter to find a better standard than the very law of justice, which dictates that everyone should take part in the perfection of the universe and in his own happiness in proportion to his own virtue and to the extent that his will has thus contributed to the common good. This exonerates what we call the charity and love of God, in which the entire force and power of the Christian religion alone consists, in the judgment of wise theologians. Nor should the fact that minds get such deference in the universe appear astonishing, since they are produced in the exact image of the Supreme Creator, and relate to him not only as machines to their builder (as other things do), but also as citizens to their prince. Likewise, they are to persist as long as the universe itself does, and they express the whole in a certain way and concentrate it in themselves, so that it might be said that they are parts that are wholes. 

   <br>&emsp;We must also hold that afflictions, especially those the good have, only lead to their greater good. This is true not only in theology, but in nature [physice] as well, since a seed flung to the ground must suffer before it bears fruit. And, all in all, one can say that afflictions that are bad in the short run are good in their effect, since they constitute a short path to greater perfection. It is just as in physics, where liquids that ferment slowly also improve more slowly, but those in which there is more violent disturbance improve more quickly because they eliminate [impure] parts with greater force. And this is what you might call stepping back in order to leap forward with greater force (one retreats the better to leap forward). These considerations must be held to be not only pleasing and consoling, but most true. I think that in the universe nothing is truer than happiness, nor is anything happier or sweeter than truth. 

   <br>&emsp;In addition to the beauties and perfections of the totality of the divine works, we must also recognize a certain constant and unbounded progress in the whole universe, so that it always proceeds to greater development [cultus], just as a large portion of our world is now cultivated [cultura] and will become more and more so. And while certain things regress to their original wild state and others are destroyed and buried, we must, however, understand this in the same way that we interpreted affliction a bit earlier. Indeed, this very destruction and burying leads us to the attainment of something better, so that we make a profit from the very loss, in a sense. 

   <br>&emsp;And there is a ready answer to the objection that if this were so, then the world should have become Paradise long ago. Many substances have already attained great perfection. However, because of the infinite divisibility of the continuum, there are always parts asleep in the abyss of things, yet to be roused and yet to be advanced to greater and better things, advanced, in a word, to greater cultivation. Thus, progress never comes to an end.

   If your highness had not ordered me to explain more distinctly what I said in passing about Descartes and his proof for the existence of God, it would have been presumptuous of me to try. For Your Highness's extraordinary intelligence (which I recognized far better when I had the honor of hearing you speak for a moment, than by reading what so many great men had published about you) anticipates everything one can tell you with respect to a subject which, no doubt, has long been the object of your most profound thoughts. Therefore, I undertake this discourse, not because I intend to propose something new to you, but in order to learn your judgment, which I do not aspire to solicit's. 

   <br>&emsp;Your Highness knows that there is nothing more trite today than demonstrations of God's existence; I observe that it is almost like proofs for squaring the circle and perpetual motion. The greenest student of mathematics and of mechanics lays claim to these sublime problems, and there is not a distiller, even the most ignorant, who does not promise himself the philosopher's stone. Similarly, all those who have learned a little metaphysics begin first with the demonstration of God's existence and the immortality of our souls, which, in my opinion, are the fruits of all our studies, since they constitute the foundation of our greatest hopes. I admit that Your Highness would have no reason to have a better opinion of me unless I told her that I came to these matters after having prepared my mind by extremely precise investigations in the rigorous sciences, which are the touchstone of our thoughts. Everywhere else people flatter themselves and find flatterers, but there are very few mathematicians who have spread errors, and there are none who could get others to approve their mistakes. In my early years I was well enough versed in the subtleties of the Thomists and Scotists, and when I left school, I threw myself into the arms of jurisprudence, which required history as well. But my travels allowed me to know some great persons who gave me a taste for mathematics. I applied myself to it with an almost disproportionate passion during the four years I resided in Paris, which resulted in greater success and public praise than a novice and stranger could have expected. With respect to analysis, I am not so bold as to say how the men greatest in these matters today have judged my work, but with respect to mechanics, the arithmetical machine, whose model I showed to the two Royal Societies of France and England, appeared to be something completely extraordinary. It is not the Rabdology of Napier' s' (the Scottish Baron) transformed into a machine, as are some others that have been made public since. The two Academies saw an infinite difference between my machine and the others, which are, in fact, mere games and have only a name in common with mine, something people will recognize when it is perfected, as I am expecting it will be. 

   <br>&emsp;As for myself, I cherished mathematics only because I found in it the traces of the art of invention in general; and it seems to me that I discovered, in the end, that Descartes himself had not yet penetrated the mystery of this great science. I recall that he said somewhere that the excellence of his method, which only appears probable from his physics, is demonstrated by his geometry. But I must admit that I mainly recognized the imperfection of his method in his geometry itself. For, we should not be surprised if there is much to criticize in his physics, since Descartes did not have enough experiments at his disposal. But geometry depends only on ourselves; it does not need external help. I claim then that there is yet another analysis in geometry which is completely different from the analysis of Viete and of Descartes, who did not advance sufficiently in this, since its most important problems do not depend on the equations to which all of Descartes's geometry reduces. Despite what he had advanced too boldly in his geometry (namely, that all problems reduce to his equations and his curved lines), he himself was forced to recognize this defect in one of his letters; for de Beaune had proposed to him one of these strange but important problems of the inverse method of tangents, and he admitted that he did not yet see it clearly enough!' I fortunately discovered that this very problem can be resolved in three lines by the new analysis which I am using. But it would be premature of me to go into the details; it suffices to say that geometry, enriched by these new means, can surpass the geometry of Vii te and Descartes as much and incomparably more than theirs surpassed the geometry of the ancients. And this is not only in curiosities, but in the solution of the most important problems for mechanics. 

   <br>&emsp;I do not wish to discuss physics here, even though I have demonstrated rules of motion that are quite different from those of Descartes. I come, then, to metaphysics, and I can state that it is for the love of metaphysics that I have passed through all these stages. For I have recognized that metaphysics is scarcely different from the true logic, that is, from the art of invention in general; for, in fact, metaphysics is natural theology, and the same God who is the source of all goods is also the principle of all knowledge. This is because the idea of God contains within it absolute being, that is, what is simple in our thoughts, from which everything that we think draws its origin. Descartes did not go about it in this way. He gave two ways of proving the existence of God. The first is that there is an idea of God in us since, no doubt, we think about God, and we cannot think of something without having its idea!" Now, if we have an idea of God, and if it is true [veritable], that is, if it is the idea of an infinite being, and if it represents it faithfully, it could not be caused by something lesser, and consequently, God himself must be its cause. Therefore, he must exist. The other reasoning is even shorter. It is that God is a being who possesses all perfections, and consequently, he possesses existence, which is to be counted as one of the perfections.'" Therefore, he exists. It must be said that these reasonings are somewhat suspect, because they go too fast, and because they force themselves upon us without enlightening us. Real demonstrations, on the other hand, generally fill the mind with some solid nourishment. However, the crux of the matter is difficult to find, and I see that many able people who have formulated objections to Descartes were led astray. 

   <br>&emsp;Some have believed that there is no idea of God because he is not subject to imagination, assuming that idea and image are the same thing. I am not of their opinion, and I know perfectly well that there are ideas of thought, existence, and similar things, of which there are no images. For we think of something and when we notice in there what it is that allows us to recognize it, this is what constitutes the idea of the thing, insofar as it is in our soul. This is why there is also an idea of what is not material or imaginable. 

   <br>&emsp;Others agree that there is an idea of God, and that this idea contains all perfections, but they cannot understand how existence follows from it, either because they do not agree that existence is to be counted among the perfections or because they do not see how a simple idea or thought can imply an existence outside us. As for me, I genuinely believe that anyone who has recognized this idea of God, and who sees that existence is a perfection, must admit that existence belongs to God. In fact, I do not question the idea of God any more than I do his existence; on the contrary, I claim to have a demonstration of it. But I do not want us to flatter ourselves and persuade ourselves that we can arrive at such a great thing with such little cost. Paralogisms are dangerous in this matter; when they occur, they reflect on us, and they strengthen the opposite side. I therefore say that we must prove with the greatest imaginable exactness that there is an idea of a completely perfect being, that is, an idea of God. It is true that the objections of those who believed that they could prove the contrary because there is no image of God are worthless, as I have just shown. But we also have to admit that the proof Descartes gives to establish the idea of God is imperfect. How, he would say, can one speak of God without thinking of him, and how can one think of him without having an idea of him? Yes, no doubt we sometimes think about impossible things and we even construct demonstrations from them. For example, Descartes holds that squaring the circle is impossible, and yet we still think about it and draw consequences about what would happen if it were given. The motion having the greatest speed is impossible in any body whatsoever, because, for example, if we assumed it in a circle, then another circle concentric to the former circle, surrounding it and firmly attached to it, would move with a speed still greater than the former, which, consequently, would not be of the greatest degree, in contradiction to what we had assumed. In spite of all that, we think about this greatest speed, something that has no idea since it is impossible. Similarly, the greatest circle of all is an impossible thing, and the number of all possible units is no less so; we have a demonstration of this. And nevertheless, we think about all this. That is why there are surely grounds for wondering whether we should be careful about the idea of the greatest of all beings, and whether it might not contain a contradiction. For I fully understand, for example, the nature of motion and speed and what it is to be greatest, but, for all that, I do not understand whether all those notions are compatible, and whether there is a way of joining them and making them into an idea of the greatest speed of which motion is capable. Similarly, although I know what being is, and what it is to be the greatest and most perfect, nevertheless I do not yet know, for all that, whether there isn't a hidden contradiction in joining all that together, as there is, in fact, in the previously stated examples. In brief, I do not yet know, for all that, whether such a being is possible, for if it were not possible, there would be no idea of it. However, I must admit that God has a great advantage, in this respect, over all other things. For to prove that he exists, it would be sufficient to prove that he is possible, something we find nowhere else, as far as I know. Moreover, I infer from that that there is a presumption that God exists. For there is always a presumption on the side of possibility, that is, everything is held to be possible unless it is proven to be impossible. There is, therefore, a presumption that God is possible, that is, that he exists, since in him existence follows from possibility. This is sufficient for practical matters in life, but it is not sufficient for a demonstration. I have strongly disputed this matter with several Cartesians, but I finally succeeded in this with some of the most able of them who have frankly admitted, after having understood 

   <br>&emsp;the force of my reasons, that this possibility is still to be demonstrated. There are even some who, challenged by me to do so, have undertaken this demonstration, but they have not yet succeeded. 

   <br>&emsp;Since Your Highness is intelligent, you see what the state of things is and you see we can do nothing unless we prove this possibility. When I consider all this, I take pity on man's weakness, and I take care not to exclude myself from it. Descartes, who was no doubt one of the greatest men of this century, erred in so visible a manner, and many illustrious people erred with him. Nevertheless, we do not question their intelligence or their care. All of this could give some people a bad opinion of the certainty of our knowledge in general. For, one can say, with so many able men unable to avoid a trap, what can I hope for, I, who am nothing compared to them? Nevertheless, we must not lose our courage. There is a way of avoiding error, which these able men have not condescended to use; it would have been contrary to the greatness of their minds, at least in appearance, and with respect to the common people. All those who wish to appear to be great figures and who set themselves up as leaders of sects have a bit of the acrobat in them. A tightrope walker does not allow himself to be braced in order to avoid falling; if he did so, he would be sure of his act, but he would no longer appear a skillful man. I will be asked, what then is this wonderful way that can prevent us from falling? I am almost afraid to say it—it appears to be too lowly. But I am speaking to Your Highness who does not judge things by their appearance. In brief, it is to construct arguments only in proper form [in forma]. I seem to see only people who cry out against me and who send me back to school. But I beg them to be a little patient, for perhaps they do not understand me; arguments in proper form do not always bear the stamp of Barbara Celarent." Any rigorous demonstration that does not omit anything necessary for the force of reasoning is of this kind, and I dare say that the account of an accountant and a calculation of analysis are arguments in proper form, since there is nothing missing in them and since the form or arrangement of the whole reasoning is the cause of their being evident. It is only the form that distinguishes an account book made according to the practice we commonly call Italian (of which Stevin has written a whole treatise) from the confused journal of someone ignorant of business. That is why I maintain that, in order to reason with evidence in all subjects, we must hold some consistent formalism [formalite constante]. There would be less eloquence, but more certainty. But in order to determine the formalism that would do no less in metaphysics, physics, and morals, than calculation does in mathematics, that would even give us degrees of probability when we can only reason probabilistically, I would have to relate here the thoughts I have on a new characteristic [characteristique], something that would take too long. Nevertheless, I will say, in brief, that this characteristic would represent our thoughts truly and distinctly, and that when a thought is composed of other simpler ones, its character would also be similarly composed. I dare not say what would follow from this for the perfection of the sciences—it would appear incredible. And yet, there is a demonstration of this. The only thing I will say here is that since that which we know is from reasoning or experience, it is certain that henceforth all reasoning in demonstrative or probable matters will demand no more skill than a calculation in algebra does; that is, one would derive from given experiments everything that can be derived, just as in algebra. But for now it is sufficient for me to note that the foundation of my characteristic is also the foundation of the demonstration of God's existence. For simple thoughts are the elements of the characteristic and simple forms are the source of things. I maintain that all simple forms are compatible among themselves. That is a proposition whose demonstration I cannot give without having to explain the fundamentals of the characteristic at length. But if that is granted, it follows that God's nature, which contains all simple forms taken absolutely, is possible. Now, we have proven above that God exists, as long as he is possible. Therefore, he exists. And that is what needed to be demonstrated.

<div id="Cartesians">

   Since you want me to frankly tell you my thoughts on Cartesianism, I will hide nothing from you that I think, at least nothing that can be stated briefly; and I will make no claims without giving or being able to give a reason for them. 

   <br>&emsp;First, all those who completely surrender themselves to the opinions of any author become enslaved and raise suspicions of error on themselves; for to assert that Descartes is the only author who is exempt from significant error is to assert something that might be true, but is not likely. In fact, this kind of attachment belongs only to those who themselves do not have the strength or the leisure to meditate, or who do not wish to take the trouble to do so. That is why the three noted Academies of our time, England's Royal Society, which was established first, and then the Academie Royale des Sciences at Paris and the Accademia del Cimento at Florence, have openly asserted that they did not want to be Aristotelians, or Cartesians, or Epicureans, or followers of any author whatever. 

   <br>&emsp;Moreover, I have recognized from experience that those who are completely Cartesian are not capable of discovery; they merely undertake the job of interpreting or commenting upon their master, as the Scholastics did with Aristotle. There have been many beautiful discoveries since Descartes, but, as far as I know, not one of them has come from a true Cartesian. I know these people a little, and I defy them to name one such discovery from their ranks. This is evidence that either Descartes did not know the true method, or else that he did not leave it to them. 

   <br>&emsp;Descartes himself had a rather limited mind. He excelled all people in speculation, but he discovered nothing useful for the portion of life which falls under the senses, and nothing useful in the practice of the arts. His meditations were either too abstract, as in his metaphysics and his geometry, or too much subject to the imagination, as in his principles of natural philosophy. The only useful things he thought he had produced were telescopic lenses, constructed according to hyperbolic curves, with which he promised to show us animals, or things as small as animals, on the moon. Unfortunately, he was never able to find workmen capable of executing his designs, and in any case, it has since been shown that the advantage of hyperbolic curves is 

   <br>&emsp;not as great as he had thought.

   <br>&emsp;It is true that Descartes was a great genius and that the sciences owe him great debts, but not in the way the Cartesians believe. Therefore, I must go into some specifics and give examples of what he borrowed from others, what he himself accomplished, and what he left us to accomplish. We shall see in this way whether I speak without knowing what I am talking about. First, his morality is a composite of the opinions of the Stoics and Epicureans— something not very difficult to do, for Seneca had already reconciled them quite well.'" Descartes wants us to follow reason, or else to follow the nature of things, as the Stoics said, something with which everybody will agree. He of their much-praised wise man in his strength of mind to do without things that we should not trouble ourselves with things that are not in our that do not depend upon us, and endure things when they come in spite of ourselves. That is why I am accustomed to calling this morality the art of patience. The supreme good, according to the Stoics, and even according to Aristotle, is to act in accordance with virtue or prudence, and the pleasure resulting from this resolution is properly the tranquility of soul or indifference [indokance] that both the Stoics and Epicureans sought for and recommended, under different names. We need only inspect the incomparable manual of Epictetus and the Epicurean of Laercia to admit that Descartes has not much advanced the practice of morality. But it seems to me that this art of patience, which for him constitutes the art of living, is not yet everything. Patience without hope cannot last and scarcely consoles; it is in this that Plato, in my opinion, surpasses all others, for he brings us to hope for a better life with good reason, and he is closest to Christianity. For one to have a high opinion of him, it is sufficient to read his excellent dialogue on the immortality of the soul (or on the death of Socrates), which Theophile has translated into French.'" I think that Pythagoras did the same thing and that his metempsychosis was only a device to accommodate the common people; among his disciples, I think, he reasoned differently. Thus, Ocellus Lucanus, who was one of his disciples, and from whom we have a small but excellent fragment of his Universe, does not say a word about metempsychosis. Someone might tell me that Descartes established the existence of God and the immortality of soul extremely well. But I fear that we are deceived by fine words, since Descartes's God, or perfect being, is not a God like the one we imagine or hope for, that is, a God just and wise, doing everything possible for the good of creatures. Rather, Descartes's God is something approaching the God of Spinoza, namely, the principle of things and a certain supreme power or primitive nature that puts everything into motion [action] and does everything that can be done. Descartes's God has neither will nor understanding, since according to Descartes he does not have the good as object of the will, nor the true as object of the understanding. Also, he does not want his God to act in accordance with some end; this is why he eliminates the search for final causes from philosophy, under the clever pretext that we are not capable of knowing God's ends." On the other hand, Plato has nicely shown that if God acts in accordance with wisdom, since God is the author of things, then the true physics consists in knowing the ends and uses of things. " For science consists in knowing reasons, and the reasons for what was created by an understanding are the final causes or plans of the understanding that made them. These are apparent in their use and function, which is why considering the use parts have is so helpful in anatomy. That is why a God like Descartes's allows us no consolation other than that of patience through strength. Descartes tells us in some places that matter passes successively through all possible forms,' that is, that his God created everything that can be made, and passes successively through all possible combinations, following a necessary and fated order. But for this doctrine, the necessity of matter alone would be sufficient, or rather, his God is merely this necessity or this principle of necessity acting as it can in matter. Therefore, it is impossible to believe that this God cares for intelligent creatures any more than he does for the others; each creature will be happy or unhappy depending upon how it finds itself engulfed in these great currents or vortices. Descartes has good reason to recommend, instead of felicity, patience without hope. 

   <br>&emsp;But one of those good people among the Cartesians, deceived by the beautiful words of his master, will tell me that Descartes has, however, quite nicely established the immortality of the soul, and consequently, a better life. When I hear such things, I am surprised by the ease with which one can deceive people merely by playing around with pleasing words, though corrupting their meaning. For as hypocrites misuse piety, heretics the Scriptures, and seditious people the word 'freedom,' so Descartes has misused the important words, 'existence of God,' and 'immortality of the soul.' We must therefore elucidate this mystery and show them that Descartes's immortality of soul is worth no more than his God. I believe that I will not bring pleasure to some, for people are normally unhappy to be awakened from a pleasant dream. But what should I do? Descartes wishes us to uproot false thoughts before introducing true ones." We must follow his example; and I believe I would be doing the public a service if I could disabuse people of such dangerous doctrines. 

   <br>&emsp;I therefore assert that the immortality of soul, as established by Descartes, is useless and could not console us in any way. For let us suppose that soul is a substance and that no substance perishes; given that, the soul would not perish and, in fact, nothing would perish in nature. But just as matter, the soul will change in its way, and just as the matter that composes a man has at other times composed other plants and animals, similarly, this soul might be immortal in fact, but it might pass through a thousand changes without remembering what it once was." But this immortality without memory is completely useless to morality, for it upsets all reward and punishment. What good would it do you to become the King of China under the condition that you forget what you once were? Would that not be the same as if God created a King of China at the same time as he destroyed you? That is why, in order to satisfy the hopes of humankind, we must prove that the God who governs all is wise and just, and that he will allow nothing to be without reward and without punishment; these are the great foundations of morality. But the doctrine of a God who does not act for the good, and of a soul which is immortal without any memory, serves only to deceive simple people and to undo spiritual people. 

   <br>&emsp;I could even show some defects in Descartes's supposed demonstration, for there is still much to be proven in order to complete it. But I believe that it would be useless to bother with this now, since these demonstrations would not be of much use for anything even if they were good demonstrations, as I have just proven. 

   <br>&emsp;It remains for me to touch upon the other sciences that Descartes has treated, in order to show examples of what he has accomplished and what he has not. I begin with geometry, since it is believed to be Descartes's strength. We must do him justice; he was a capable geometer, but not so capable as to eclipse the others. He pretends not to have read Viete; however, Viete has said much, and what Descartes has added to this is, first, a more distinct inquiry into solid curved lines or curved lines that intersect solids, by means of equations referring to coordinates, and second, the method of tangents by two equal roots. However, he speaks in geometry with an unfounded loftiness. He boldly asserts that all problems can be resolved by his method. But he was obliged to admit in some exchanges, first, that the arithmetical problems of Diophantus were not in his power to solve, and second, that the inverse of tangents also surpassed it. Yet these inverses of tangents are the most sublime and useful part of geometry. I believe that few Cartesians will understand what I wish to say, for there are very few excellent geometers among them; they are satisfied with resolving some small problems using their master's methods of calculation, and the two or three great geometers of our time who are commonly counted among the Cartesians recognize only too well the things I have just said for them to be judged Cartesians. 

   <br>&emsp;Descartes's astronomy is, at its root, only the astronomy of Copernicus and Kepler, to which Descartes has added an improvement, explaining more distinctly the connection among planetary bodies by means of the fluid matter that is pushed by their motion, in contrast with Kepler, who, having kept some residual Scholastic notions, still employed imaginary virtues. But Kepler had prepared this matter so well that the synthesis Descartes fashioned between the corpuscular philosophy and Copernicus's astronomy was not very difficult. I say the same for the magnetic philosophy of Gilbert. And yet I recognize that what Descartes says about the magnet, about the ebb and flow of the sea, and about meteors, is quite ingenious and surpasses everything that the Ancients said about them!" However, I still do not venture to say if he got matters exactly right. His Optics has some admirable passages, but it also has some indefensible passages. For example, he correctly established the proportion between sines [in refraction], but ir• a clumsy way, for the reasons he brought to bear in order to prove the laws of refraction are worthless. I believe that capable geometers are still in agreement about this."' 

   <br>&emsp;As for anatomy and the knowledge of man, Descartes is indebted to Harvey who discovered the circulation of the blood. But I do not find anything he discovered that is useful and demonstratively certain. He is too taken with reasoning about the invisible parts of our body, before having explored the parts that are visible. Steno has made it clear that Descartes was completely mistaken in his opinion about the movement of the heart and muscles."' Most unfortunately for physics and medicine, Descartes lost his life by believing himself extremely capable in medicine, putting aside the advice of others, and at first refusing to allow himself to be cared for when he became ill in Sweden. We must admit that he was a great man, and that if he had lived, perhaps he would have corrected some of his errors (if his arrogance would have allowed it). Still, he would certainly have made some important discoveries. But it is just as certain that he would not have had the reputation he had in his time, when there were few able people capable of measuring up to him, or rather, when they were young people barely beginning. But since then we have discovered things in geometry that Descartes believed impossible, and in physics we are making discoveries that surpass in usefulness all his pretty fictions concerning imaginary vortices. In addition, Descartes was ignorant of chemistry, without which it is impossible to advance in applied physics. What he said about salts would deserve the pity of those who are knowledgeable on this, and one can clearly see that he did not understand their differences. If he had had less ambition to make a sect for himself, more patience in reasoning about sensible things, and less inclination to give himself over to the invisible, he would perhaps have put forth the foundations of the true physics, for he had the considerable talent necessary to succeed in this. But since he strayed from the true path, he harmed his reputation, which will not be as solid as that of Archimedes. We will soon forget the beautiful novel of physics which he has given us."' It is, therefore, left to posterity to start building on better foundations, incapable of being shaken, foundations that the illustrious Academies are busily putting forth. Let us therefore follow their example, and let us contribute to these beautiful plans, or else, if we are not capable of discovery, let us at least keep the freedom of mind that is so necessary for being rational.

<div id="TwoSectsNaturalists">

   There are two sects of naturalists fashionable today which have their source in antiquity; the one revives the opinions of Epicurus and the other is, in fact, composed of Stoics. The former believes that any substance, including the soul and God himself, is corporeal, that is to say, composed of extended matter or mass. From this it follows that there cannot be an all- powerful and all-knowing God, for how could a body act on everything without being affected by everything and without being destroyed? This is what somebody named Vorstius recognized; he refused his God all of the grand attributes that other men ordinarily give to theirs. Some have believed that the sun, which, judging by the senses, is undeniably the most powerful of all visible things, is God; but they did not know that the fixed stars are suns as well, and that consequently, one sun alone cannot see everything nor do everything. All bodies are heavy and very active if they are large, and weak if they are small, but if they have a great power in spite of their smallness (as in the case of gunpowder), then they destroy themselves by acting. This is why a body cannot be God. Moreover, Epicurus in times past, and Hobbes today, who hold all things to be corporeal, have given enough evidence to show that, on their view, there is no providence. 

   <br>&emsp;The sect of the new Stoics believes that there are incorporeal substances, that human souls are not bodies, and that God is the soul of the world, or, if you wish, the primary power of the world, that he is the cause of matter itself, if you wish, but that a blind necessity determines him to act; for this reason, he will be to the world what the spring or the weight is to a clock. They further believe that there is a mechanical necessity in all things, that things really act because of his power and not due to a rational choice of this divinity, since, properly speaking, God has neither understanding nor will, which are attributes of men. They believe that all possible things happen one after the other, following all the variations of which matter is capable; that we must not seek final causes; that we are not sure of the immortality of the soul or of future life; that there is no justice or benevolence with respect to God, that he determines what constitutes benevolence and justice, and that, consequently, he would have done nothing contrary to justice by making the innocent always miserable. This is why these gentlemen admit providence in name only. And as for what is of consequence and what concerns the conduct of our lives, everything reduces to the opinions of the Epicureans, that is, to the view that there is no happiness other than the tranquility of a life here below content with its own lot, since it is madness to oppose the torrent of things and to be discontented with what is immutable. If they knew that all things are ordered for the general good and for the particular welfare of those who know how to make use of them, they would not identify happiness with simple patience. I know that their phrases are very different from some of the ones I have just presented, but anyone fathoming their views would agree with what I have just stated. In fact, these are Spinoza's views, and there are many people to whom Descartes appears to be of the same opinion. Certainly, he made himself very suspect by rejecting the search for final causes, by maintaining that there is no justice nor benevolence, nor even truth, except because God has determined them in an absolute way, and finally, by letting slip (though in passing) that all the possible variations of matter happen successively, one after another!" 

   <br>&emsp;If these two sects of Epicureans and Stoics are dangerous to piety, the sect of Socrates and Plato, which (I believe) comes partly from Pythagoras, is so much the more suitable for it. One need only read Plato's admirable dialogue on the immortality of the soul to discover some opinions that are completely opposed to those of our new Stoics.'" In it, Socrates speaks on the very day of his death, a bit before receiving the deadly cup. He chases sadness from the minds of his friends, substituting wonder in them through marvelous arguments, and it appears that he leaves this life only to enjoy in another the happiness prepared for lofty souls. I believe, he says, that in departing I will find better men than those here; but, at very least, I am certain that I will find the gods there. He maintains that final causes are the principles in physics and that we must seek them in order to account for things. And it seems that he is mocking our new physicists when he mocks Anaxagoras. What he says about him deserves to be heard. 

   <br>&emsp;I heard one day (he said) someone reading in a book of Anaxagoras, in which it was said that an intelligent being was the cause of all things and that he had disposed and arranged them. That pleased me greatly, for I believed that if the world were the effect of an intelligence, everything would be done in the most perfect manner possible. That is why I believed that anyone who wanted to account for why things are produced or perish, or why they subsist, must look for what would be appropriate to the perfection of any given thing. And so, a man would need to consider in himself or in something else only that which would be the best or the most perfect. One who knows the most perfect could easily judge what is imperfect from this, for knowing the one amounts to knowing the other. 

   <br>&emsp;Considering all this, I rejoiced in having found a teacher who could teach the reasons for things—for example, whether the earth is round rather than flat, and why it was better that it be this way rather than otherwise. Moreover, I expected that when saying that the earth is at the center of the universe, or that it is not, he would explain to me why it was most appropriate for it to be this way, and I expected he would tell me as much about the sun, moon, stars and their motions. And finally, after having shown what was most suitable for each thing in particular, he would have shown what was best in general. Filled with this hope, I quickly got hold of the books of Anaxagoras and ran through them with great haste. But I found myself far from my expectation, for I was surprised to see that he did not make use of the governing intelligence that he had first posited, that he no longer spoke of the arrangement nor of the perfection of things, and that he introduced certain ethereal matters that are hardly probable. In this he seemed like someone who, having said that Socrates does things through intelligence, and then going on to explain in particular the causes of his actions, says that he is seated here because he has a body composed of bones, flesh and sinews, that his bones are hard, but that they are separated by intervals or junctures, that the sinews can be tightened or relaxed, and that this is why the body is flexible and finally why I am seated here. Or, if, wishing to account for this present discourse, he were to refer to the air, to the organs of voice and hearing, and the like, forgetting, however, the true causes, namely that the Athenians believed that it would be better to condemn me rather than to absolve me, and that I believed that it was better to sit here rather than to flee. For, by my faith, without this, these sinews and bones would long have been among the Boeotians and Megarians, if I hadn't thought it more just and more honorable [honneste] of me to suffer the penalty imposed by my native land rather than to live elsewhere as a wanderer and an exile. That is why it is unreasonable to call these bones and sinews and their motion causes. It is true that whoever would say that I could not do all this without bones and sinew would be right. But something else is the true cause, and they constitute only a condition without which the cause could not be a cause. Those who only say, for example, that motions of bodies around the earth keep it here, where it is, forget that divine power disposes everything in the finest way, and do not understand that it is the good and the beautiful that join, form, and maintain the world. Until now this has been Socrates, for that which follows on ideas or forms in Plato is a bit more difficult, though no less excellent.

<div id="Locke">

   Since the Essays on the Understanding, published by an illustrious Englishman, is one of the finest and most esteemed works of our age, I resolved to comment on it, insofar as I had given sufficient thought for some time to the same subject and to most of the matters touched upon there; I thought that this would be a good opportunity to publish something entitled New Essays on the Understanding and to procure a more favorable reception for my thoughts by putting them in such good company. I further thought that I might profit from someone else's work, not only to make my task easier (since, in fact, it is easier to follow the thread of a good author than to work out everything anew), but also to add something to what he has given us, which is always easier than starting from the beginning. It is true that I often hold an opinion different from his, but far from denying on that account the merit of this famous writer, I bear witness to it by showing in what and why, I differ from his view, when I deem it necessary to prevent his authority from prevailing against reason on some important points. 

   <br>&emsp;In fact, although the author of the Essay says a thousand fine things of which I approve, our systems are very different. His bears more relation to Aristotle's and mine to Plato's, although we both differ in many ways from the doctrines of these two ancients. He is more popular while I am forced at times to be a little more esoteric and abstract, which is not an advantage to me, especially when writing in a living language. However, I believe that by making two characters speak, one of whom presents the views of the author of the Essay, while the other adds my observations, the parallel will be more to the liking of the reader than some dry remarks, whose reading would have to be interrupted at every moment by the necessity of having to return to the author's book in order to understand mine. Nevertheless, it would be good to compare our writings from time to time, and to judge his views by his work alone, even though I have usually retained his expressions. It is true that the constraint of having to follow the thread of someone else's discourse in making my remarks has meant that I could not think of capturing the charm of which the dialogue is capable, but I hope that the content will make up for the defect in style. 

   <br>&emsp;Our differences are about subjects of some importance. There is the question about whether the soul in itself is completely empty like tablets upon which nothing has been written (tabula rasa), as Aristotle and the author of the Essay maintain, and whether everything inscribed on it comes solely from the senses and from experience, or whether the soul contains from the beginning the source [principe] of several notions and doctrines, which external objects awaken only on certain occasions, as I believe with Plato and even with the Schoolmen, and with all those who find this meaning in the passage of St. Paul (Romans 2:15) where he states that the law of God is written in our hearts The Stoics call these principles Prolepses, that is, fundamental assumptions, or what is taken as agreed in advance. Mathematicians call them common notions, (koinai ennoiai). Modern philosophers give them other fine names, and Julius Scaliger in particular called them the seeds of eternity, and also zopyra, meaning living fires, or flashes of light hidden inside us but made to appear through the contact of the senses, like sparks that can be struck from a steel. And it is not unreasonable to believe that these flashes reveal something divine and eternal, something that especially appears in necessary truths. This raises another question, namely, whether all truths depend upon experience, that is, upon induction and instances, or whether some of them have another foundation. For if some occurrences can be foreseen before they have been tested, it is obvious that we contribute something of our own here. Although the senses are necessary for all our actual knowledge, they are not sufficient to give us all of it, since the senses never give us anything but instances, that is, particular or individual truths. Now all the instances confirming a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of that same truth, for it does not follow that what has happened before will always happen in the same way. For example, the Greeks, Romans, and all other people of the earth have always observed that before the passage of twenty-four hours, day changes into night and night into day. But they would have been mistaken if they had believed that the same rule is observed everywhere, since the contrary was observed during a visit to Nova Zembla. And anyone who believed that this is a necessary and eternal truth, at least in our climate, would also be mistaken, since we must recognize that the earth and even the sun do not exist necessarily, and that there may be a time when this beautiful star will no longer exist, at least in its present form, and neither will its whole system. As a result it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances nor, consequently, on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never occur to us to think of them. This is a distinction that should be noted carefully, and it is one Euclid understood so well that he proves by reason things that are sufficiently evident through experience and sensible images. Logic, together with metaphysics and morals, of which the one shapes natural theology and the other natural jurisprudence, are full of such truths, and consequently, their proof can only arise from internal principles, which are called innate. It is true that we must not imagine that we can read these eternal laws of reason in the soul from an open book, as the edict of the praetor can be read from his tablet without effort and scrutiny. But it is enough that they can be discovered in us by dint of attention; the senses furnish occasions for this, and the success of experiments also serves to confirm reason, a bit like empirical trials help us avoid errors of calculation in arithmetic when the reasoning is long. Also, it is in this respect that human knowledge differs from that of beasts. Beasts are purely empirical and are guided solely by instances, for, as far as we are able to judge, they never manage to form necessary propositions, whereas man is capable of demonstrative knowledge [sciences demonstratives]. In this, the faculty beasts have for drawing consequences is inferior to the reason humans have. The consequences beasts draw are just like those of simple empirics, who claim that what has happened will happen again in a case where what strikes them is similar, without being able to determine whether the same reasons are at work. This is what makes it so easy for men to capture beasts, and so easy for simple empirics to make mistakes. Not even people made skillful by age and experience are exempt from this when they rely too much on their past experiences. This has happened to several people in civil and military affairs, since they do not take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the world changes and that men have become more skillful in finding thousands of new tricks, unlike the stags and hares of today, who have not become any more clever than those of yesterday. The consequences beasts draw are only a shadow of reasoning, that is, they are only connections of imagination, transitions from one image to another; for, when a new situation appears similar to the preceding one, they expect to find again what was previously joined to it, as though things were linked in fact, just because their images are linked in the memory. It is, indeed, true that reason ordinarily counsels us to expect that we will find in the future that which conforms to our long experience of the past; but this is not, on that account, a necessary and infallible truth, and it can fail us when we least expect it, when the reasons which have maintained it change. This is why the wisest people do not rely on it to such an extent that they do not try to probe into the reason for what happens (if that is possible), so as to judge when exceptions must be made. For only reason is capable of establishing sure rules and of providing what uncertain rules lack by formulating exceptions to them, and lastly, capable of finding connections that are certain in the compulsion [force] of necessary consequences. This often provides a way of foreseeing an occurrence without having to experience the sensible links between images, which the beasts are reduced to doing. Thus what justifies the internal principles of necessary truths also distinguishes humans from beasts. 

   <br>&emsp;Perhaps our able author will not entirely disagree with my opinion. For after having devoted his whole first book to rejecting innate illumination, understood in a certain way, he admits, however, at the beginning of the second book and in what follows, that the ideas which do not originate in sensation come from reflection. Now, reflection is nothing other than attention to what is within us, and the senses do not give us what we already bring with us. Given this, can anyone deny that there is a great deal innate in our mind, since we are innate to ourselves, so to speak, and since we have within ourselves being, unity, substance, duration, change, action, perception, pleasure, and a thousand other objects of our intellectual ideas? And since these objects are immediate and always present to our understanding (though they may not always be perceived consciously [appercus] on account of our distractions and our needs), why should it be surprising that we say that these ideas, and everything that depends upon them, are innate in us? I have also used the comparison with a block of veined marble, rather than a completely uniform block of marble, or an empty tablet, that is, what the philosophers call a tabula rasa. For if the soul were like these empty tablets, truths would be in us as the shape of Hercules is in a block of marble, when the marble is completely indifferent to receiving this shape or another. But if the stone had veins which marked out the shape of Hercules rather than other shapes, then that block would be more determined with respect to that shape and Hercules would be as though innate in it in some sense, even though some labor would be required for these veins to be exposed and polished into clarity by the removal of everything that prevents them from appearing. This is how ideas and truths are innate in us, as natural inclinations, dispositions, habits, or potentialities [virtualites] are, and not as actions are, although these potentialities are always accompanied by some corresponding, though often insensible, actions. 

   <br>&emsp;Our able author seems to claim that there is nothing potential [virtuel] in us, and even nothing that we are not always actually conscious of perceiving [appercevions]. But he cannot hold this in all strictness; otherwise his position would be too paradoxical, since, again, acquired habits and the contents of our memory are not always consciously perceived [apperfues] and do not even always come to our aid when needed, though often we easily recall them to mind when some trivial occasion reminds us of them, as when we need only the beginning of a song to make us remember the rest. He also limits his thesis in other places, saying that there is nothing in us that we did not at least previously perceive consciously [apperfu]. But no one can guarantee by reason alone how far back our past and perhaps forgotten apperceptions can go, especially in view of the Platonists' doctrine of reminiscence, which, fabulous though it is, is not at all incompatible with pure reason. Furthermore, why must it be that everything is acquired by apperceptions of external things and that nothing can be unearthed from within ourselves? Is our soul in itself so empty that, without images borrowed from the outside, it is nothing? This is not, I am convinced, a view our judicious author could approve. Where could one find some tablets which do not have a certain amount of variety in themselves? Will we ever see a perfectly homogeneous and uniform surface? 

   <br>&emsp;Then why could we not also provide ourselves some object of thought from our own depths, when we are willing to dig there? Thus I am led to believe that, fundamentally, his view on this point is no different from mine, or rather from the common view, insofar as he recognizes two sources of our knowledge, the senses and reflection. 

   <br>&emsp;I do not know whether it will be as easy to reconcile him with me and with the Cartesians when he maintains that the mind does not always think, and in particular, that it is without perception during dreamless sleep, and when he objects that since bodies can be without motion, souls can just as well be without thought. But here I reply somewhat differently from what is customary. For I maintain that a substance cannot naturally be without action, and that there is never even any body without motion. Experience already supports me, and to be convinced of this, one need only consult the book of the illustrious Mr. Boyle against absolute rest. But I believe that reason also supports this, and it is one of the proofs I use for refuting atoms. Moreover, there are a thousand indications that allow us to judge that at every moment there is an infinity of perceptions in us, but without apperception and without reflection—that is, changes in the soul itself, which we do not consciously perceive [appercevons], because these impressions are either too small or too numerous, or too homogeneous, in the sense that they have nothing sufficiently distinct in themselves; but combined with others, they do have their effect and make themselves felt in the assemblage, at least confusedly. It is in this way that custom makes us ignore the motion of a mill or of a waterfall, after we have lived nearby for some time. It is not that this motion ceases to strike our organs and that there is nothing corresponding to it in the soul, on account of the harmony of the soul and the body, but that the impressions in the soul and in the body, lacking the appeal of novelty, are not sufficiently strong to attract our attention and memory, which are applied only to more demanding objects. All attention requires memory, and when we are not alerted, so to speak, to pay heed to some of our own present perceptions, we let them pass without reflection and without even noticing them. But if someone alerts us to them right away and makes us take note, for example, of some noise we have just heard, we remember it, and we consciously perceive that we just had some sensation of it. Thus there were perceptions that we did not consciously perceive right away, the apperception in this case arising only after an interval, however brief. In order better to recognize [juger] these tiny perceptions [petites perceptions] that cannot be distinguished in a crowd, I usually make use of the example of the roar or noise of the sea that strikes us when we are at the shore. In order to hear this noise as we do, we must hear the parts that make up this whole, that is, we must hear the noise of each wave, even though each of these small noises is known only in the confused assemblage of all the others, and would not be noticed if the wave making it were the only one. For we must be slightly affected by the motion of this wave, and we must have some perception of each of these noises, however small they may be, otherwise we would not have the noise of a hundred thousand waves, since a hundred thousand nothings cannot make something. Moreover, we never sleep so soundly that we do not have some weak and confused sensation, and we would never be awakened by the greatest noise in the world if we did not have some perception of its beginning, small as it might be, just as we could never break a rope by the greatest effort in the world, unless it were stretched and strained slightly by the least efforts, even though the slight extension they produce is not apparent. 

   <br>&emsp;These tiny perceptions are therefore more effectual than one thinks. They make up this I-know-not-what, those flavors, those images of the sensory qualities, clear in the aggregate but confused in their parts; they make up those impressions the surrounding bodies make on us, which involve the infinite, and this connection that each being has with the rest of the universe. It can even be said that as a result of these tiny perceptions, the present is filled with the future and laden with the past, that everything conspires together (sympnoia panta, as Hippocrates said), and that eyes as piercing as those of God could read the whole sequence of the universe in the smallest of substances. 

   <br>&emsp;The things that are, the things that have been, and the things that will soon be brought in by the future!' 

   <br>&emsp;These insensible perceptions also indicate and constitute the individual, which is individuated [caracterise] by the traces which these perceptions preserve of its previous states, connecting it up with his present state. They can be known by a superior mind, even when the individual himself does not sense them, that is, when he no longer has an explicit memory of them. But these perceptions even provide a way of recovering the memory, as needed, through periodic unfoldings which may occur one day. That is why death might only be a state of sleep, and might not even remain one, insofar as the perceptions merely cease to be sufficiently distinct and, in animals, are reduced to a state of confusion which suspends apperception, but which cannot last forever; I shall not speak here of man, who ought to have great prerogatives in this matter in order to retain his personality. 

   <br>&emsp;It is also by means of these insensible perceptions that I explain the marvelous pre-established harmony between the soul and the body, and also between all the monads or simple substances, which takes the place of that untenable influence of the one on the others, and which, in the judgment of the author of the finest of dictionaries,' raises the greatness of divine perfections beyond anything ever conceived before. After this I would add little if I said that it is these tiny perceptions which determine us in many situations without our thinking of them, and which deceive the common people by giving the appearance of an indifference of equilibrium, as if it made no difference to us, for example, whether we turned right or left. Nor is it necessary for me to point out here, as I've done in the book itself, 3" that they cause this uneasiness, which I show to consist in something that differs from pain only as the small differs from the great, and yet which often brings about our desire and even our pleasure by giving it a kind of spice. The insensible parts of our sensible perceptions also bring about a relation between those perceptions of color, heat, and other sensible qualities, and the motions in bodies that correspond to them. But the Cartesians and our author, penetrating though he is, think of the perceptions we have of these qualities as arbitrary, that is, as if God had given them to the soul according to his good pleasure without having regard to any essential relation between perceptions and their objects, a view which surprises me and seems to me unworthy of the wisdom of the author of things, who does nothing without harmony and reason. 

   <br>&emsp;In short, insensible perceptions have as much use in philosophy of mind [Pneumatique] as corpuscles do in physics; and it is equally unreasonable to reject the one as the other under the pretext that they are beyond the reach of the senses. Nothing takes place all at once, and it is one of the greatest and best verified maxims that nature never makes leaps; this is what I called the law of continuity when I once spoke about this in the Nouvelles de la republique des lettres, and this law is of considerable use in physics. It entails that one always passes from the small to the large and back again through what lies between, both in degrees and in parts, and that a motion never arises immediately from rest nor is it reduced to rest except through a lesser motion, just as we never manage to pass through any line or length before having passed through a shorter one. But until now, those who have given the laws of motion have not observed this law, believing that a body can instantaneously receive a motion opposite to the previous motion. All this can allow us to judge that noticeable perceptions arise by degrees from ones too small to be noticed. To judge otherwise is to know little of the immense subtlety of things, which always and everywhere involves an actual infinity. 

   <br>&emsp;I have also noticed that because of insensible variations, two individual things cannot be perfectly alike and must always differ in something over and above number. This puts an end to the empty tablets of the soul, a soul without thought, a substance without action, void space, atoms, and even particles in matter not actually divided, complete uniformity in a part of time, place, or matter, the perfect globes of the second element that derive from the perfect original cubes, and a thousand other fictions of philosophers which arise from their incomplete notions. These are things that the nature of things does not allow, things that are allowed to pass because of our ignorance and lack of attention; they cannot be tolerated unless we limit them to being abstractions of the mind, which protests that it does not deny the things it sets aside, but only judges that they need not enter into consideration at present. If we thought in earnest that things we do not consciously perceive [s'apperfoit] are not in the soul or in the body, we would fail in philosophy as in politics, by neglecting the mikron, imperceptible changes. But an abstraction is not an error, provided we know that what we are ignoring is really there. This is similar to what mathematicians do when they talk about the perfect lines they propose to us, uniform motions and other regular effects, although matter (that is, the mixture of the effects of the surrounding infinity) always provides some exception. We proceed in this way in order to distinguish various considerations and, as far as is possible, to reduce effects to their reasons, and foresee some of their consequences. For the more careful we are not to neglect any consideration we can subject to rules [reguler], the more closely practice corresponds to theory. But only the supreme reason, which nothing escapes, can distinctly understand the whole infinite, all the reasons, and all the consequences. With respect to infinities, we can only know them confusedly, but at least we can distinctly know that they exist, otherwise we would be very poor judges of the beauty and greatness of the universe, just as we would also be unable to develop a good physics which explains the nature of things in general, and still less a good philosophy of mind [Pneumatique], which includes the knowledge of God, of souls, and of simple substances in general. 

   <br>&emsp;This knowledge of insensible perceptions also serves to explain why and how two souls of the same species, whether human or otherwise, never leave the hands of the creator perfectly alike, and why and how each of them always has its original relation to the point of view it will have in the universe. But this already follows from what I pointed out previously about two individuals, namely that the difference between them is always more than numerical. There is another significant point on which I must differ, not only from the opinion of our author, but also from those of most of the moderns. I hold with most of the ancients that all spiritual beings [genies], all souls, all simple created substances, are always joined to a body, and that souls are never completely separated from bodies. I have a priori reasons for this, but this doctrine will be found to have the further advantage that it resolves all the philosophical difficulties about the state of souls, their perpetual conservation, their immor- tality, and their operation. Since the difference between one of their states and another is never, nor has it ever been anything but the difference between the more and the less sensible, between the more and the less perfect (or the other way around), the past or future state of souls is just as explicable as their present one. The slightest reflection is sufficient to show that this is reasonable, and that a leap from one state to an infinitely different one cannot be natural. I am surprised that the schools, by needlessly abandoning nature, have been willing to readily plunge into enormous difficulties, and thus to give free thinkers [esprits forts] an opportunity for their apparent triumphs. The arguments of the free thinkers collapse all at once with this explanation of things, in which it is no more difficult to conceive the preservation of souls (or rather, on my view, of the animal), than it is to conceive the change from caterpillar to butterfly and the preservation of thought in sleep, to which Jesus Christ has divinely compared death. Also, I have already said that no sleep can last forever; but it will have less duration or almost no duration at all in the case of rational souls, which are always destined to remain the persons [person- nage] they were in the city of God, and consequently, to retain their memory, so that they can be better able to receive rewards and punishments. I further add that, in general, no disordering of its visible organs is capable of bringing things in the animal to the point of complete confusion, or to destroy all its organs, and to deprive the soul of the whole of its organic body and of the ineradicable remains of all its preceding traces. But the ease with which people have aban- doned the ancient doctrine that angels have subtle bodies (a doctrine which has been confused with the corporality of angels), the introduction of the allegedly separated intelligences among created things (to which the intelligences that rotated Aristotle's heavens have contributed much), and finally the poorly un- derstood opinion some have held that we cannot retain the souls of beasts with- out falling into metempsychosis, all these in my opinion have resulted in the neglect of the natural way of explaining the preservation of the soul. This has done great harm to natural religion, and has led many to believe that our immortality is nothing but a miraculous grace of God. Our celebrated author speaks with some doubt about this, as I will soon point out. But I wish that all who are of this opinion discussed it as wisely and as sincerely as he does. For it is to be feared that several who speak of immortality through grace merely do so in order to preserve appearances, and are at bottom not very far from those Averroists and certain pernicious Quietists who imagine an absorption and reunion of the soul with the ocean of divinity, a notion whose impossibility is clearly shown by my system alone, perhaps. 

   <br>&emsp;It seems, moreover, that we also disagree about matter, insofar as the author judges that the void is necessary for motion, since he believes that the small parts of matter are rigid. I admit that if matter were composed of such parts, motion in a plenum would be impossible; it would be as if a room were filled with a quantity of little pebbles without containing the least empty place. But I cannot grant this assumption, for which there seems to be no reason, even though this able author goes so far as to believe that the rigidity or the cohesion of the small parts constitutes the essence of bodies. Rather, we should conceive of space as filled with matter that was originally fluid, matter capable of any division, and indeed, actually subjected to division and subdivision to infinity, but with this difference, however, that it is unequally divisible and unequally divided in different places because of the motions there, motions which are already more or less harmonious. This brings it about that it has rigidity as well as fluidity everywhere, and that no body is hard or fluid to the ultimate degree, that is, that no atom has insuperable hardness, nor is any mass entirely indifferent to division. The order of nature, and particularly the law of continuity, also destroys both alternatives equally well. 

   <br>&emsp;I have also shown that cohesion, which is not itself an effect of impulsion or lions at a distance, without it being possible to make them intelligible; I do not see what would prevent our Scholastics from saying that everything happens simply through faculties and from maintaining their intentional species, which go from objects to us and find a way of entering our souls. If this is acceptable, 

   <br>&emsp;What I said could not be will now happen.' 

   <br>&emsp;So it seems to me that our author, judicious as he is, is here going rather too much from one extreme to the other. He raises difficulties about the operations of souls, when it is merely a matter of admitting what is not sensible, while here he grants bodies what is not even intelligible, allowing them powers and actions beyond everything which, in my opinion, a created mind could do or understand; for he grants them attraction, even at great distances, without limitation to any sphere of activity, and he does so in order to maintain a view which is no less inexplicable, namely the possibility of matter thinking in the natural order of things.' 

   <br>&emsp;The question he is discussing with the noted prelate who had attacked him is whether matter can think. Since this is an important point, and an important point for the present work as well, I cannot avoid going into it a bit, and taking account of their debate. I shall represent the substance of their dispute and take the liberty of saying what I think of it. The late Bishop of Worcester, fearing (but without great cause, in my opinion) that the author's doctrine of ideas was subject to some abuses prejudicial to the Christian faith, undertook to examine some aspects of it in his Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity. He first gives this excellent writer his due, by recognizing that the writer judges that the existence of the mind is as certain as that of the body, even though as regards these substances, the one is as little known as the other. He then asks (pages 241 seqq.) how reflection could assure us of the existence of the mind if God can give matter the faculty of thinking, as our author believes (Book IV, chap. 3, [sec. 6]) since, as a consequence, the way of ideas, which should serve to discriminate what can belong to the soul or to the body, would become useless. However, it was said in Book II of the Essay on the Understanding (chap. 23, sec. 15, 27, 28), that the operations of the soul provide us with the idea of the mind, and that the understanding, together with the will, makes this idea as intelligible to us as the nature of body is made intelligible by solidity and impulse. Here is how our author replies to this in his First Letter (pp. 65 seqq.): [[I think that I have proved that there is a spiritual substance in us.] For we experiment in ourselves thinking. The idea of this action, or mode of thinking, is inconsistent with the idea of self-subsistence, and therefore has a necessary connection with a support or subject of inhesion: the idea of that support is what we call substance. . . . The general idea of substance being the same everywhere, the modification of thinking, or the power of thinking, joined to it, makes it a spirit, without considering what other modification it has, as whether it has the modification of solidity or not. As, on the other side, substance, that has the modification of solidity, is matter, whether it has the modification of thinking or no. And therefore, if your lordship means by a spiritual, an immaterial substance, I grant I have not proved, nor upon my principles, can it be proved [ . . . ] that there is an immaterial substance in us [ . . . . ] Though I presume, what I have said about the supposition of a system of matter [ . . . ] (Book IV, chap 10, sec. 16) (which there demonstrates that God is immaterial) will prove it in the highest degree probable, that the thinking substance in us is immaterial. . . .[[Yet I have shown (adds the author, p. 68)]] that all the great ends of religion and morality are secured . . . by the immortality of the soul, without a necessary supposition that the soul is immaterial. 

   <br>&emsp;In his Reply to this letter, to show that our author was of another opinion when he wrote Book II of the Essay, the learned Bishop quotes (p. 51) the following passage (Book II, chap. 23, sec. 15), where it is said that by the simple ideas we have taken from those operations of our own minds [ . . . ] we are able to frame the complex idea of spirit. And thus, by putting together the ideas of thinking, perceiving, liberty, and power of moving our bodies, we have as clear a [ . . . ] notion of immaterial substances as we have of material." He further cites other passages to show that the author opposed mind to body. He says (p. 54) that the end of religion and morality is better secured by proving that the soul is immortal by its very nature, that is, immaterial. He further cites this passage (p. 70), that all the ideas we have of particular, distinct sorts of substances are nothing but several combinations of simple ideas,' and that, consequently, the author believed that the idea of thinking and willing results in a substance different from that given by the idea of solidity and impulse. And he says that in sec. 17 the author remarks that the latter ideas constitute the body as opposed to the mind 

   <br>&emsp;The Bishop of Worcester could have added that from the fact that the general idea of substance is in body and in mind, it does not follow that their differences are modifications of a single thing, as our author just said in the passage I cited from his First Letter. We must distinguish between modifications and attributes. The faculties of having perception and of acting, as well as extension, and solidity, are attributes, or perpetual and principal predicates; but thought, impetuosity, shapes, and motions are modifications of these attributes. Moreover, we must distinguish between the physical (or real) genus and logical (or ideal) genus. The things of the same physical genus, or those which are homogeneous, are of the same matter, so to speak, and can often be changed from one into another by changing their modifications, like circles and squares. But two heterogeneous things can have a common logical genus, and then their differences are neither simple accidental modifications of a single subject, nor of a single metaphysical or physical matter. Thus time and space are quite heterogeneous things, and we would be wrong to imagine some common real subject I-know-not-what which had only continuous quantity in general and whose modifications resulted in time or space. Yet their common logical genus is continuous quantity. Someone might perhaps make fun of these philosophical distinctions between two genera, the one only logical and the other real, and between two matters, the one physical—that of bodies—and the other only metaphysical or general, as if someone were to say that two parts of space are of the same matter or that two hours are also of the same matter as one another. Yet these distinctions concern not only terms, but also things themselves, and seem to be particularly relevant here, where their confusion has given rise to a false conclusion. These two genera have a common notion, and the notion of real genus is common to both sets of matters, so that their genealogy would be as follows: GENUS:the merely logical, distinguished by simple differences --- the real, that is, MATTER, where differences are modifications --- the merely metaphysical, in which there is homogeneity --- the physical, in which there is a solid, homogeneous mass.

   <br>&emsp;I have not seen the author's Second Letter to the bishop; the Reply that the prelate makes to it hardly touches the point about the thinking of matter. But our author's Reply to this Second Reply returns to it. God (he says, nearly in these words, page 397) adds the qualities and perfections that please him to the essence of matter; to some parts [he adds] simple motion, to plants vegetation, and to animals sensation. Those who agree with me so far exclaim against me as soon as I go a step further and say that God may give to matter thought, reason, and volition—as if this would destroy the essence of matter. But to prove this assertion they advance that thought or reason is not included in the essence of matter; this proves nothing since motion and life are not included in it either. They also advance that we cannot conceive that matter can think; but our conception is not the measure of God's power. After this he quotes the example of the attraction of matter (p. 99, but especially p. 408), in which he speaks of the gravitation of matter toward matter, attributed to Mr. Newton, in the words I quoted above, admitting that we can never conceive how this happens. This is, in fact, a return to occult qualities or, what is more, to inexplicable qualities. He adds (p. 401) that nothing is more apt to favor the skeptics than denying what we don't understand, and (p. 402) that we do not even conceive how the soul thinks. He holds (p. 403) that since the two substances, material and immaterial, can be conceived in their bare essence without any activity, it is up to God to give the power of thinking to the one or to the other. And he wants to take advantage of his adversary's view, which grants sensation to beasts, but does not grant them any immaterial substance. He claims that freedom, self-consciousness (p. 408), and the power of making abstractions can be given to matter, not as matter, but as enriched by divine power. Finally he reports (p. 434) the observation of a traveller as eminent and judicious as Mr. de la Loubere that the pagans of the East know of the immortality of the soul without being able to understand its immateriality. 

   <br>&emsp;With regard to all this I will note, before coming to the explanation of my opinion, that it is certain that matter is as little capable of producing sensation mechanically as it is of producing reason, as our author agrees. Furthermore, I note, indeed, that I recognize that we are not allowed to deny what we do not understand, though I add that we have the right to deny (at least in the order of nature) what is absolutely unintelligible and inexplicable. I also maintain that substances (material or immaterial) cannot be conceived in their bare essence without activity, and that activity is of the essence of substance in general. And finally, I maintain that the conception of creatures is not the measure of God's power, but that their conceptivity, or ability [force] to conceive, is the measure of nature's power; everything in conformity with the natural order can be conceived or understood by some creature. 

   <br>&emsp;Those who understand my system will judge that I will not be in complete agreement with either of these two excellent authors, whose dispute, however, is very instructive. But to explain myself distinctly, one must above all take into account that the modifications which can come naturally or without miracle to a single subject must come to it from the limitations or variations of a real genus or of an original nature, constant and absolute. For this is how in philosophy we distinguish the modes of an absolute being from the being itself; for example, we know that magnitude, shape, and motion are obviously limitations and variations of corporeal nature. For it is clear how a limitation of extension produces shapes, and that the change which takes place there is nothing but motion. And every time we find some quality in a subject, we ought to think that, if we understood the nature of this subject and of this quality, we would understand how this quality could result from that nature. Thus in the order of nature (setting miracles aside) God does not arbitrarily give these or those qualities indifferently to substances; he never gives them any but those which are natural to them, that is to say, those that can be derived from their nature as explicable modifications. Thus we can judge that matter does not naturally have the attraction mentioned above, and does not of itself move on a curved path, because it is not possible to conceive how this takes place, that is to say, it is not possible to explain it mechanically, whereas that which is natural should be capable of becoming distinctly conceivable, if we were admitted into the secrets of things. This distinction between what is natural and explicable and what is inexplicable and miraculous removes all the difficulties: if we were to reject it, we would uphold something worse than occult qualities, and in doing so we would renounce philosophy and reason, and throw open refuges for ignorance and idleness through a hollow system, a system which admits not only that there are qualities we do not understand (of which there are only too many) but also that there are some qualities that the greatest mind could not understand, even if God provided him with every possible advantage, that is, qualities that would be either miraculous or without rhyme or reason. And it would indeed be without rhyme or reason that God should ordinarily perform miracles, so that this do-nothing hypothesis would equally destroy philosophy, which searches for reasons, and the divine wisdom, which provides them. 

   <br>&emsp;As for the question of thinking, it is certain—and our author recognizes in more than one place—that thinking cannot be an intelligible modification of matter, that is, that a sensing or thinking being is not a mechanical thing like a watch or a windmill, in the sense that we could conceive of magnitudes, shapes and motions whose mechanical conjunction could produce something thinking, and even sensing, in a mass in which there was nothing of the kind, that would likewise cease to be if the mechanism got out of order. Thus it is not natural for matter to sense and to think, and there are only two ways in which it could do so. One of these would be for God to join to it a substance to which thought is natural, and the other would be for God to endow it with thought miraculously. In this, then, I agree entirely with the Cartesians, except that I extend the view to beasts as well, and believe that they have sensation and souls which are, properly speaking, immaterial and as imperishable as the atoms of Democritus or Gassendi. But the Cartesians, who are confused about the souls of beasts, and do not know what to do with them if they are preserved (since it did not occur to them that the animal might be preserved in a reduced form), have been forced to deny them even sensation, contrary to all appearances, and contrary to the judgment of mankind. But if someone said that God, at very least, can add this faculty of thinking to a mechanism properly prepared, I would answer that if this occurred, and if God added this faculty to matter without at the same time endowing it with a substance that was the subject in which this same faculty inhered (as I conceive it), that is, without adding an immaterial soul there, then matter would have to be raised miraculously so as to be capable of receiving a power of which it is not capable naturally, just as some Scholastics claim that God raises fire to the point of giving it the power directly to burn minds separated from matter, which would be a miracle, pure and simple. It is enough that we can maintain that matter thinks only if we attribute to it either an imperishable soul, or else a miracle, and thus, that the immortality of our souls follows from what is natural, since we could then hold that they are destroyed only by miracle, whether by exalting matter or by annihilating the soul. For we know, of course, that the power of God could make our souls mortal, even though they may be immaterial (or immortal by nature alone), since he is capable of annihilating them. 

   <br>&emsp;Now the truth of the immateriality of the soul is undoubtedly important. For it is infinitely more useful to religion and morality, especially in our days (when many people have scant respect for revelation by itself or for miracles), to show that souls are naturally immortal, and that it would be a miracle if they were not, than it would be to maintain that our souls must naturally die, and that it is due to a miraculous grace, based solely on God's promise, that they do not die. Moreover, we have known for a long time that those who wished to destroy natural religion, and reduce everything to revelation, as if reason taught us nothing about it, have been held suspect, and not always without reason. But our author is not of their number. He maintains a demonstration of God's existence and he attributes to the immateriality of the soul a probability of the highest degree, which may consequently pass for a moral certainty, so that I imagine that, having as much sincerity as penetration, he might quite well come to agree with the doctrine I have just expounded, a doctrine fundamental in every reasonable philosophy. For otherwise, I do not see how we can prevent ourselves from falling back into a fanatical philosophy, such as the Mosaic philosophy of Fludd, which saves all phenomena by attributing them immediately and miraculously to God, or into a barbaric philosophy, like that of certain philosophers and physicians of former days, who still savored of the barbarism of their own age, and who today are justly despised. They saved the appearances by explicitly fabricating suitable occult qualities or faculties, which were thought to be like little demons or spirits able to do what was required of them without any fuss, just as if pocket watches told time by some faculty of clockness without the need of wheels, or mills crushed grain by a fractive faculty without the need of anything like millstones. As for the difficulty many people have had in conceiving an immaterial substance, it soon ceases (at least in large part) when one no longer requires substances separated from matter; I hold, in fact, that such substances have never existed naturally among created things.

   It is, unfortunately, our destiny that, because of a certain aversion toward light, people love to be returned to darkness. We see this today, where the great ease for acquiring learning has brought forth contempt for the doctrines taught, and an abundance of truths of the highest clarity has led to a love for difficult nonsense. Clever people have such a lust for variety that, in the midst of an abundance of fruits, it seems they want to revert to acorns. That physics which explains everything in the nature of body through number, measure, weight, or size, shape and motion, which teaches that nothing is moved naturally except through contact and motion, and so teaches that, in physics, everything happens mechanically, that is, intelligibly, this physics seems excessively clear and easy. We must return to chimeras, to Archae, to certain plastic intelligences that attend to the formation of the fetus, and afterwards, to the care of the animal, intelligences that are sometimes lively and bold, sometimes timid and gentle, and despairing, at the end, like people, having lost control. It has often been observed that feelings [affectus] in the mind [animus] lead to illness, but this is not astonishing, since pleasant motions always accompany joyful feelings, and great motions always accompany vehement feelings. However, this has given some people an excuse for imagining in animals certain inner guardians [praeses], which are stimulated, calmed, excited, or dulled as circumstances arise, some of which are general guardians for the governing of the whole body, some of which are particular supervisors of certain limbs or internal organs, cardiosupervisors, gastrosuper- visors, and others of that kind. And it is surprising that they don't teach that these spirits can be summoned with magic words, as a certain monk, seeking the philosopher's stone summoned the Spirit of Mercury. They would do well to recognize a more divine mechanism in the body of animals. But they believe that nothing is quite divine enough unless it is opposed to reason, and they think that what happens in [animate] bodies is so elevated that not even divine skill could make such machines. These barely skilled judges think that divine works are necessary, and so they think that God everywhere uses little vice-deities (lest God himself always have to act miraculously), just like those who once attributed the motions of the stars to their own special intelligences. 

   <br>&emsp;It pleases others to return to occult qualities or to Scholastic faculties, but since those crude philosophers and physicians [see that] those [terms are] in bad repute, changing the name, they call them forces. But true corporeal forces are only of one kind, namely, those arising through the impression of impetus (as for example, when a body is flung forward), which even have a role to play in insensible motions. But these persons imagine specific forces, and vary them as the need arises. They bring forth attractive, retentive, repulsive, directive, expansive, and contractive faculties. This can be forgiven in Gilbert and Cabaeus, and even quite recently in Honoratus Fabri, since the clear foundation [ratio] for philosophizing either had not yet become known, or had not yet been sufficiently appreciated. But what person of understanding would now bring forward these chimerical qualities, which have been repeatedly offered up as the ultimate principles of things? It is permissible to recognize magnetic, elastic, and other sorts of forces, but only insofar as we understand that they are not primitive or incapable of being explained, but arise from motions and shapes. However, the new patrons of such things don't want this. It has been observed in our own times that there is a truth in the suggestion of earlier thinkers who maintained that the planets gravitate and tend toward one another. It pleased them to make the immediate inference that all matter essentially has a God-given and inherent attractive power and, as it were, mutual love, as if matter had senses, or as if a certain intelligence were given to each part of matter by whose means each part could perceive and desire even the most remote thing. [They argue ] as if there were no room for mechanical explanations by which the effort [conatus] gross [crassus] bodies make in striving toward the great bodies of the cosmos could be accounted for through the motion of smaller pervading bodies. These same people threaten to give us other occult qualities of this sort, and thus, in the end, they may lead us back to the kingdom of darkness. 

   <br>&emsp;First the ancients, and on their example, many more recent people have rightly used intermediate principles for explaining the nature of things, principles that are, indeed, insufficiently explained, but principles which could be explained and which we could hope to reduce to prior and simpler principles, and, in the end, to first principles. I think that this is praiseworthy as long as composite things are reduced to simpler things. For in nature, things must proceed by steps, and one cannot go immediately to the first causes. Therefore, those who have shown that the astronomical laws can be explained by assuming the mutual gravitation of the planets have done something very worth- while, even if they may not have given the reason for this gravitation. But if certain people, abusing this beautiful discovery, think that the explanation [ratio] given is so satisfactory that there is nothing left to explain, and if they think that gravity is a thing essential to matter, then they slip back into barbarism in physics and into the occult qualities of the Scholastics. They even fabricate what they cannot prove through the phenomena, for so far, except for the force by which sensible bodies move toward the center of the earth, they have not been able to bring forward any trace of the general attraction of matter in our region. Consequently, we must be careful not to proceed from a few instances to everything, as Gilbert sees a magnet everywhere, and the chemists smell salt, sulphur, and mercury everywhere. Such explanations are usually considered insufficient, and sometimes we derive not only things of uncertain existence from assuming such explanations, but also false and impossible things, like that general striving [nisus] of matter for matter. 

   <br>&emsp;Now physicists have taken either things or qualities as causes. Some have assumed things as elements, like Thales' water, or Heraclitus' fire, others, the four elements, fire, air, water, and earth. Some unknown contriver of the greatest antiquity convinced even the common people of this latter view, and the author of the book On Generation and Corruption, the author of the book On the Universe, attributed to Ocellus Lucanus, and Galen have followed the common opinion on the matter (Aristotle seems to have added to this a fifth stellar element). Later, the older chemists brought forward sulphur and mercury, and the more recent chemists brought forward salt, sulphur and mercury, and added the passive matters phlegm and terre damnata to these primary active matters. Boyle examined these in his Sceptical Chemist. The most recent chemists have introduced alkali and acid as active things. Bohnius has written about the insufficiency of this. There were also those, such as Anaxagoras, inventor of the idea of homoeomeria, who set up innumerable principles, and those who gave things their own seeds, not only to animals and plants, but also to metals, jewels, and other things of this kind. 

   <br>&emsp;Also, there is no lack of people who have advocated certain incorporeal substances operating in bodies, like the Soul of the World [Anima Mundt], or like particular souls that belong to each and every thing. Similar are those who attributed sense to everything, as Campanella advanced in his book on sensation in things and on magic, and as Henry More did with his hylarchic principle, which corresponds to the Soul of the World, and against which Sturm wrote. The ancients had already spoken of a certain wise Nature, acting for ends, doing nothing in vain, something worthy of praise if it is understood as applying to God or to some artifice God placed in things from the beginning, but otherwise empty. Certain persons place in things various Archae, like so many souls or spirits, indeed, like little gods, wonderfully intelligent plastic substances, which order and regulate organic bodies. And finally, there were those who summoned God or gods ex machina in the way that the pagans imagined that Jupiter rains or thunders and that he has filled the woods and waters with gods or near gods. Certain ancient Christians, and in our age, Fludd, author of the Mosaic Philosophy (elegantly refuted by Gassendi), and more recently the authors and advocates of the system of occasional causes, all believed that God acts immediately on natural things through perpetual miracle. 

   <br>&emsp;These people, indeed, have used substances as causes. But some people have added qualities which they have also called faculties, virtues, and most recently, forces. Such were the sympathy or antipathy, or strife and friendship of Empedocles; such were heat, cold, moistness, and dryness, the four primary qualities of the Peripatetics and followers of Galen; such were the sensible and intentional species of the Scholastics, and also the expulsive, retentive, and change-causing faculties of the physicians who taught in barbaric times. More recently, Telesio has tried to set many things straight with operant heat, and some chemists, especially the followers of [J.B.] van Helmont and Marcus Marci, have introduced certain effective ideas [ideas operatrices]. Most recently in England, some have tried to bring back attractive and repulsive forces, about which we shall soon have more to say. We also ought to add those who imagine motion to be like an incorporeal substance or Pythagorean soul, transmigrating from body to body. And many who use substances as principles attribute unexplained qualities to them. And so, for example, they attribute to the elements those four often mentioned qualities, and they attribute to chemical principles their strife and friendship, and forces for fermenting, dissolving, coagulating, and precipitating; they attribute to Archae their effective ideas, and their plastic powers. Bayle has recently begun to attack these things. The author of the book on ancient medicine, attributed to Hippocrates, long ago opposed the four qualities as sufficient principles. Sennert also added diseases independent of these four qualities, which he attributed to the substance as a whole. 

   <br>&emsp;Some of these people can be excused, indeed, they ought to be praised, since they tried to explain more composite things through certain simpler bodies or qualities. Thus many things have been explained, and not badly, through fire, air, water, and earth, and then through salts soluble in water, oils or sulphurs soluble in fire, and finally through limes or earth, that persist in fire, and spirits or waters that evaporate in fire. Indeed, in this way, sensible effects have been explained by causes which fall within the senses, something most conducive to practical applications and to imitating and improving upon nature, whose customs, so to speak, are best observed in the realm of plants and animals, especially with regard to propagation, growth, and diminishment. It will also be useful for us to observe that things separated from one another by force, or things akin to them, promptly join with one another, even after setting other things into motion, and that many bodies in the realm of minerals are true products of the chemical laboratory of nature, produced by real fire, either now by subterranean fire, or long ago by fire contained in the whole crust of the earth, vitrifying some of them, and expelling others that are capable of evaporation. From this we have shown how to explain the sea, sand, shores, stones, earths, and many qualities observed in them. ' 

   <br>&emsp;But many sensible effects remain which we have not been able to reduce to sensible causes, like the workings of the magnet, or like the particular powers [vires] that belong to simple things, no trace of which is found in the parts derived from them through chemical analysis, as, for example, appears to be the case with poisonous or medicinal plants. Here we sometimes turn to analogy, and we are not doing badly if we can explain many things on the example and likeness of few. Thus having observed the attraction and repulsion of certain things, such as magnets and things made of amber, it seemed that one could establish the forces that are at work there and also found in other things. And so Gilbert, who was the first to write about the magnet with care, and not without good results, conjectured that magnetism also lay hidden in many other things. In this, however, he was repeatedly mistaken, as was Kepler—in other respects a most excellent man—who devised certain attracting or repelling magnetic fibres among the planets. It was also in this way that the common philosophers invented a certain 'avoidance of vacuum' from a few experiments with pumps and bellows, until Galileo showed that the power [potential of aspirating pumps, as they call them, or the power of those things into whose place air cannot come, a resistance to separation which they attributed to that avoidance of vacuum, can be overcome. Torricelli, in the end, reduced it to the weight of the air above us, a palpable cause existing in nature. Nor was there any reason why they should have attributed a quality of abhorring a vacuum to Nature. For us to know that a vacuum cannot be created with any amount of force, it is sufficient for us to know that everything is, once and for all, full, and that the matter exactly filling a place cannot be squeezed into a smaller space. The sensible vacuum, which we create by machines and which nature was long believed to abhor and refuse, does not exclude subtler bodies. And so, learned men often imagined things that don't exist, and they extended too far what they did observe in certain cases. However, we should praise them because they gave us conjectures that should not be scorned, conjectures which were successful in certain respects, at least. Furthermore, we shouldn't criticize these men because they tried to put certain subordinate principles in place so that they might, step by step, advance toward their causes. 

   <br>&emsp;But we should criticize those who hold these subordinate principles as primitive and inexplicable, as, for example, those who fabricated miracles, or those who fabricated incorporeal ideas [sententia] that produce, regulate, and govern bodies, those who put forward the four elements or the four primary qualities as if they contain the ultimate explanation of things, or those who, uninterested in understanding the particular force by which we evacuate with pumps, the force which we find to resist our opening a bellows lacking an aperture, set up in nature which abhors, as it were, the vacuum a primitive, essential, and insuperable quality. And whoever isn't, with us, eager to know qualities hitherto hidden, that is, unknown, has invented qualities of eternal obscurity, mysterious, inexplicable, which not even the greatest genius can know or render intelligible. 

   <br>&emsp;Such are those who, induced by the successful discovery that the great bodies of this planetary system have an attraction for one another and for their sensible parts, imagine that every body whatsoever is attracted by every other by virtue of a force in matter itself, whether it is as if a thing takes pleasure in another similar thing, and senses it even from a distance, or whether it is brought about by God, who takes care of this through perpetual miracle, so that bodies seek one another, as if they sensed each other. However it might be, these people cannot, at any rate, reduce this attraction to impulse or to intelligible reasons (as Plato already did in the Timaeus), nor do they want to. The seeds of this view are apparent in Roberval's Aristarchus, elegantly criticized by Descartes in a certain letter to Mersenne, though Roberval, perhaps, had not excluded mechanical causes. But it is astonishing that there are those who now, in the great light of our age, hope to persuade the world of a doctrine so foreign to reason. John Locke, in the first edition of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, judged that it is appropriate that no body is moved except through the impulse of a body touching it, as did Hobbes and Boyle, distinguished countrymen of his, and, following them, many others who strengthened mechanistic physics. But afterwards, having followed the authority of his friends, I think, more than his judgment, he retracted this opinion and believed that I know not what wonderful things can lie hidden in the essence of matter. It is just as if someone believed that there are occult qualities hidden in number, in time, in space, in motion considered in and of themselves, that is, it is just as if someone were to look for a knot on a bullrush 'and wanted to force the clear to be obscure.

   <br>&emsp;Robert Boyle once refuted such views quite nicely when he rejected the thread [funiculus] binding matter together proposed by Franciscus Linus and Thomas White, because, of course, it assumed something imaginary and inexplicable which binds the very thread together.' But, at least, this thread was corporeal and more intelligible (indeed, intelligible in something contiguous) than the new and incorporeal attractive force, working at any distance whatsoever without any medium or means. We can scarcely imagine anything more foolish than this in nature! And nevertheless, these people seem to have thought that they said something worthy of admiration. And now they go further and find fault with the idea that the flow of the light of the stars is instantaneously diffused through the medium, by which means the Scholastics once tried to render more intelligible the operation on distant things. What might Descartes or Boyle now say if they came back? What refutations would suffice for them to bury this new and revived chimera? And once assumed, they are forced by this view of the essential attraction of matter to defend the vacuum, since the attraction of everything for everything else would be pointless if everything were full. But in the true philosophy, the vacuum is rejected for other reasons. Indeed, I myself, when young, tried in a little book of physical hypotheses to reduce all phenomena to three operative qualities, namely to gravity, elastic force, and magnetic force."' However, I did not deny, in fact, I explicitly judged, that they ought to be explained through the simplest and most truly primitive things, that is, through size, shape, and motion. 

   <br>&emsp;As is well known, Democritus, together with Leucippus, was the first to try to cleanse physics of mysterious qualities, and said that qualities exist only by convention [ex opinione], that they are appearances, not true things."' However, one mysterious quality remained, the insuperable hardness of his atoms, or at least, the insuperable hardness he imagined to be in his atoms, and since errors are fertile soil for bringing forth further errors, from this he was also led to defend the vacuum. Epicurus added two further fictions, the heaviness [gravitas] of atoms, and their deflection without cause, which Cicero elegantly ridiculed. In his Physics, Aristotle proceeded most correctly from the report of those views, and quite clearly had already set out the position against the vacuum and atoms that Descartes and Hobbes later revived. Other works in which Aristotle seems to have philosophized more crudely are either not his, or were written exoterically. Gassendi also maintained atoms and the vacuum (two things both mysterious and absurd). Kenelm Digby (together with Thomas White), who otherwise didn't philosophize badly in his main work (for I won't linger over the incredible passages of his little book on sympathies), retained an absolute condensation and rarefaction, as did Honoratus Fabri, who consequently also assumed elastic force as something primitive, over and above heaviness [gravitas]. Galileo Galilei, Joachim Jungius, Rene Descartes, and Thomas Hobbes, to whom one can add Gassendi and his followers, setting aside atoms and the vacuum, have quite clearly purged inexplicable chimeras from physics, and having revived Archimedes's use of mathematics in physics, they have quite clearly purged inexplicable chimeras from philosophy and taught that everything in corporeal nature should be explained mechanically. But (not to mention, for the moment, the insufficiently trustworthy mechanical hypotheses, to which they were excessively addicted) they have not sufficiently recognized the true metaphysical principles or the explanations of motion and laws of nature that derive from them. 

   <br>&emsp;Therefore, I tried to fill this gap, and have at last shown that everything happens mechanically in nature, but that the principles of mechanism are metaphysical and that the laws of motion and nature have been established, not with absolute necessity, but from the will of a wise cause, not from a pure exercise of will, but from the fitness [convenientia] of things. I have shown that force must be added to mass [massa], but that force is exercised only through an impressed impetus. Instead of Archae, intelligences or plastic faculties, instincts, anti-sympathies or similar qualities, the artifice of divine mechanism is sufficient for explaining how things work, especially in the organic bodies of plants and animals, keeping only the perception and appetite of the soul, having eliminated all physical influx of body into soul or of soul into body. But even if not all bodies are organic, nevertheless organic bodies lie hidden in everything, even in inorganic bodies, so that all mass [massa], either unordered [rudis] or completely uniform in appearance, is within itself not uniform but diversified, however, ordered, not confused in its diversity. And so, I have shown that organisms are everywhere, and nowhere is there chaos unworthy of wisdom, and that all organic bodies in Nature are animated, but neither souls nor bodies change one another' s laws. I have shown that everything in bodies takes place through shape and motion, everything in souls through perception and appetite; that in the latter there is a kingdom of final causes, in the former a kingdom of efficient causes, which two kingdoms are virtually independent of one another, but nevertheless are harmonious; that God (the common final and efficient cause of things) accommodates everything to his ends through inter- mediaries that act through themselves [per media spontanea], and that souls and bodies, though infallibly following their own laws, agree nevertheless through a harmony pre-established by God, without any physical influx between one another, and that in this a new and most beautiful proof of divinity lies hidden. Finally, I showed that bodies are only aggregates that constitute a unity accidentally [per accidens], or by extrinsic denomination and, to that extent, are well-founded phenomena; that only monads (among which the best are souls, and among souls, the best are minds) are substances, and from this I showed that the indestructibility of all souls (which in minds is also the true immortality of the person) can be settled beyond controversy. And so, I showed that a more elevated metaphysics and ethics, that is, a more elevated natural theology and an eternal and divine jurisprudence can be established, and that from the known causes of things is derived a knowledge of true happiness.

   Forewardly, I say that things fit the measure; what is the measure though? I begin astutely, on the common ground of something good; this does not say what the value is, but that which and whatever they are, our aim is to properly and regularly meet that. Moreso, and as an admittance (for ignorance's sake), am I willing to say that further than that, I claim not to know. I suspect that we are clearly an intellect, one of which that inquires and realizes that they are A) one, and B) helmed through the body, to which they bring agency. In that, I firmly say, that the fullest and roundest aims that this mean can get, are enough and satisfactory to me, for I am one, the intellect.
   <br>&emsp;What I can say most clearly, is that my life is fine and we are free. Nothing can impair me, for nothing is prompt to be taken, possibly, when it comes to what I seek. "My faculties and reason are the tools of my heart, stretching me further as I settle into our day." These things can be dull or sharp, but they will never be taken away. "Even in prison, I can think and be, relishing our very interest and inquiry; moreso, using our gift of strength and grit, can I remain happy that we are fine and stable, no matter what comes our way: for we know we end the same."

<div id="aman">
   I wish to be generous: it is where I am living the most. There are requirements though, in both ground and ability — so we may contribute. Our motivation then rests on the balance between the satisfaction of an abundant expression, and the strategy to acquire the means of doing so. Foremost, would I accept the fact that it is us in which we’re seeking; not infamy and fame, no, rather a fortune which is simple and enough, wherein the time offered is simply industrious and well. Those terms (within that aim) might be what's worth addressing. Firstly is being prolific, which merely suggests your efforts are consistent and abundant; furthermore, would industry describe pure genius and design, creating something new whilst being resourceful in the way you generate its scope. Lastly is collaboration, which widens the floor in which you dance and increases the amount of hands to hold; the result here being the amount of substance offered in total, as each and all are contributing. On this latter lies a principle of fortune: if you have put enough time and effort in, than more is easily welcomed. This is the case since efficiencys and niche efforts have a rooted place to add too, compared to being the root themselves. "As if you were adding the finishing pages to your book, compared to starting from nothing."
   <br>&emsp;This note is worth considering in terms of our development. When it comes to us, our dignity and helmsmanship carry us in a regular way; from doing so, we stand firm and tall, able to be and thrive individually. If you imagined a tent being pitched, consider the grip of its tip being pulled indefinitely; consider the base of the tent and its sides, and whether or not the width would shorten or increase. The accessibility of various levels of interest could be assigned a need of effort(by the user) and room for interaction(the fortune present). On the former, we could say that niche efforts are placed higher than baser ones; for example, writing is a bedrock activity whereas sculpting is much more unique. In other words, the model here is reminiscent of a cone. The width reflects the ease by which you do things, and the height reflects the complexity of the project. As another example then, would intricate dance sit further above, as its complexity was to a higher degree than simply reading. And even though the efforts here were of a higher kind, the fortune required for it to have a working place, need be higher as well. Whereas writing, study, leisure and baser fun, can be had in any circumstance or time — as they are easy to get going - while intricate performances or specialty practices need more flexibility and contribution to reach a comparable state of progress. "It is easier to get halfway through a book than it is to complete half a ballet."
   <br>&emsp;Here, the dynamic of maturity avails. Simply, the situation proceeds like this. If you are tall and true, the world will be enough, for two reasons. Being sound allows for an impression of the world richer and equally inspiring; secondly, the accessibility of treating higher things(from being taller, or mature) allows for an increased involvement and treatment onto that which you see- wherein all despair and dullness is flattened. Two points regarding expression and its demands can be made. First, reflects the basic need for maturity, that is the height of oneself, where being so sees those generous claims as your treat. The problem arises though if and whenever you deflate and descend into the realm of the second issue. This dynamic can more or less be summarized into ‘the amount in which we are living, along with what we have to do so’. This is where friendship and fellows or comrades of similar interests come into play. If you have 4 or 5 people who work together, contributing towards a body of work composed of individual and collaborative efforts, then the overall substance becomes relatively large; consequently, there is room and resources to invite further and more particular efforts. This, in contrast to our solo efforts, is as such in this simple way. You live at 95, treated to the ripest fruits of writing and craft, while meddling in and taming the works of film and development; as a group though, you may be riding 75 with 5 others, the result being work that isn’t great but more abundant, allowing for consistent contributions to be made; moreso, does this body of work encourage that principle of substance, solidifying the current efforts into something sturdy and inviting, wherein other projects and craft become more accessible, as well as furthering the draw of other workers and patrons. "As in finance, is it easier to add five dollars to ten, than it is to one."
   <br>&emsp;The concerns here are in both of two ways. On the first example, you have the issue of substance, as you are solely you; on the second is the concern of strength in your work. I will discuss the former. Being mature matches the peak of your time with the quality of work; its design and care amounts to something original and pure, satisfying too. However the substance does not accrue and shine in such an obvious way. One reason is that the path of maturity, initially at least, does not see you out and about in a social way; generally, you are at home and within yourself, and this does not put your effort clearly on display. Secondly, is the nature by which you would work, and what could be shared and shown; considering the abundance of group work, the particular efforts of solo work may seem smaller in size, and to hand crafted to be set for a wide display. The issue lies in the demand of your attention, and how the niche and smaller things have less room for complete dedication — compared to the baser things in writing, for example. In effect, the great things you do as a mature person are in the nature of inquiry and development, compared to something grand and obvious of which requires equal dedication but the room in which someone on their own may be lacking. Consequently, those who seek a more sound and rooted life, can struggle with the mingling of proper generosity, in the good in it wholeheartedly, alongside the place where it is actually seen and found. The mature person holds himself to the strongest of efforts despite these concerns, consistent through greatness and reflection, able and hopeful to reach a point where more wood is added to the fire: “he is merely kindling though.”
   <br>&emsp;On the second of those former issues, is in regards to the vector of joy. Joy, is simply the metric for living. It is not truly life when actions are restricted, rather when they are open and accepted. This why for example, virtue in character conquers all of time, for even in dire states, courage and fortitude (to name a few), take misfortune and make it acceptable and deliberate; in cultivating the proper response to our condition, we can helm ourselves prominently, trusting that we can but, equally and to the point, that we should. In that case at least, would our response be welcomed — as we were positive to its necessity. Anyway, when it comes to the way we spend our time, it is best spent in a way where, on mass, the joy(so to speak) is the highest possible. In my estimation then, this requires the stance of us and the aim of things which draw us to be involved, and thus with joy. No one seeks trouble, but if we truly wish to live lavishly and flourishly, then our interests and aim ought be for activities that truly are positive, in that we can throw ourselves into them without much effort or fuss — for they are the ones which draw us the most.
   <br>&emsp;The distinction then of maturity and group efforts is in the demand of those working. On maturity, this stance sets itself on the strength required to partake in the bedrock of things: the inquiry of god and matter, reflections of death and our lives. These interests permeate throughout other cares, but are helmed and initiated only by your heart and ability. In comparison, a group levels the way, allowing for general interest to be the craft: photography, performance, discussion, analysis. These efforts are for those fortunate enough to do them, for they are personally done amidst the pillars of work past done — in which these particular efforts can rest. It is worth noting strictly, that the limit of being alone or being in a group, is not bent in a way that either explicitly holds to. It is merely the case that one who is alone, will rely on and repair themselves moreso than is required in the group, and those in the group will have less need or demand to be so helmed. The consequence is seen in contrast of the two: to those mature, their work will be baser and less substantial(and thus more difficult to share), whereas the group will do more things, interesting ones at that, but be less refined and pure than those who are great.
   <br>&emsp;The point then, is that neither the individual or the group need lack the cares of each other. A mature man can still ready their craft, in a way in which it is substantial; moreso, can they make sturdy ground besides this, seeking harmony with provision and their rooted cares, and, in addition and continuously, keep active and open to the interests of other individuals, allowing for the potential to form a trio or pair. In a similar way, the group can still hold themselves to a higher standard, being more individual about their fortuned efforts. If they truly cared about being generous, then the bedrock of things plus the reverence for inquiry, can see truer and sounder impressions and aims for their efforts, born out and demonstrated through their fortune of the group — and thus their substance.
   <br>&emsp;I feel as though, to bring this all together, that a balance and care for each side of the coin is what’s worth regarding. Your comfort zone and fallibility in the quest for maturity should not heed you from any attention towards furthering the engines and working hands. Hold yourself to the highest standard, and relish the void of an unexamined life, but don’t hesitate to encourage and align yourself with select others — who opportunely may feel the same. Moreso, to actually cherish the route you’ve chosen in the first place and trust those aims and their kind of way; doing so will make you more available to others, as you are still in fact producing by yourself. Even if this steady state is your place, and you are in fact on your own, those prior reasons ought to keep promises in front of you — which will hopefully remove the discouragement of lackluster fortune. Be reminded though, that a fearful response to this is not correct. “Do not be looking for professional or traditional appeasement, if artistry, industry, and maturity pulls your gaze.” If being helmed through maturity and her gain is what you look towards, and is where your constitution is kept, merely stay confident about the rewards that will come, through being yourself and in response from others. “Running away to more comforting pastures, will only see you fail at both.” Building on that in regards to the group, I would say that it is enough if you see what the mature man does, only that you are separate in the wares that you have to materialize the interest. It is the case that those who find themselves in companies and teams, may not have the aim of joy and well being; I don’t suspect though that their efforts will bring them to any other place, seeing as good living eventually refines rough edges. In more ways than not then, a member or the whole team, can bring themselves further by simply recognizing that they have good fortune: wherein the point in which it is for will become more clear, and consequently draw one and all's attention to that.
</div>
<div id="prominence">
   I will add something to the aim of maturity. Simply said(as I am reiterating), maturity is the expression of a helmed self. The root of this is the awareness of that self, along with the resolve to care and treat it. Being the unit and vector for measurement, our mind and its mixtures turn in on themselves, noticing whether they are well fitted or not. "It is the very act of being conscious, that paves the eventual way for recognition that one is, and thus, bearing one's self as if that were the medium." The world does act on us, but its treatment is discerned, conditioned, and responded through the conscious. It is merely an internally bound system. Beyond further complexities of this motion, we can purely say that the proper helming of this address is the mark of maturity. "To carry one’s self, as a proper one through the world, regular and reverent."
   <br>&emsp;Now, I bring this up for the concern of this way and what it brings. It is through this summary of the mind, that an agent is the measure. The quality and state of the being is impressed on and altered by the world to the point of 'you as the measure, not the world'. Following this, with the image of a single man let's say, you could describe his state as being well and rounded, narrow or of width, plump with satisfaction or boring and stiff. This state of the unit is what I would like to expound on. It is the case of maturity, that the agent is incessant to their nature. They deal with that wholeheartedly and through, caring little for how others are, or the world to. The reason, is that their interaction is spent generously in an expressive state; all they can do that interferes with others is all that comes from them; knowing this, they treat themselves with the utmost attention and care, so an offer of purity and abundance can be made.
   <br>&emsp;Accepting this, we must consider the position of one who is mature. The life of doing so is a sort of industry in its own right. As the automotive or service industries have their own customs and ambition, so will the mature man have. Not only will he trust in his make, but he will also address the fact that he has come from not. In retrospect, an understanding of the universe as his lineage may seep deep enough into him so he can see that there is no need for concession or reticence - or rather a fear of missing out from opposing gains. In reaching that point though(where all is known) the man who we could describe as 'maturing', will increasingly reflect on the claims that he's made, but admit the fragility in which they are held. Only when a completely sound mantra(so to speak) is known, can he relax his attention; only when he can carry himself by his own weight, will we say his nature is rounded and set: Until then, his nature must be tended. The progress in reaching this becomes unquestionably easier. As you proceed, you shed your rust and ambition, settling into a proper coat that is bathed in congruence and adjustment. This arrangement is an easy one at its core, despite any initial misgivings - as you may have bolted skin to shed that needs doing so. "Who though, would falter or hide from the gains of simply being themselves? and where is the real difficulty in working for that?"
   <br>&emsp;Reaching the stage in which you are mature then is definitively a state of prominence, rather than one which is absolute. A nature of something reflects what it does. In our case at least, those actions are rooted in the response we have to the environment. The nature of one who is beyond recognition is strictly the place of complete maturity. "Your place in the world, when met without ease or care, yet a gain of smooth and consistent experience is regular, then you can say that you are beyond a nature: you purely be."
</div>
<div id="ambition">
   I am being generous thoroughly but my effort is ill-prepared. I would describe this as one who is lacking occupation and aims for some setting ahead. Compared to that, you would normally be congruent to work's demands, appreciative of any time in waiting. In addition, I would say that a feeling of indifference to how that mean time is spent is common, for your interests are relative to the work ahead. Going home or taking a break is neutral in the precedent of this free time; working time and your profession are what require your attention, while the rest can be of comfort or in bed. It seems simply put, that your time has no bearing outside your primary venture, and thus, you are satisfied with doing nothing. In contrast to this, is one who lives immediately, but sees little far ahead. By this, I mean one who is mature and bound, seeking a prudent as well as industrious life. Here, they are reciprocal to all things, treating them in response to their own interest and craft. This way of life is different from those of occupation, in that they seek no stronger position or place, whereas those who are professional seek things of a more open and comforting kind. Effectively, the former lives as if they are already made, hearing and seeing the world in front of themselves and tributing it now. The latter however, put their head down, suspend wholesome ambition, and settle onto the track of future gain. This course though is not one that eventually prevails into a greater kind of maturity and its reward; instead, they're treated to the promise of more things, the ease from aligning and succeeding in their development, and the satisfaction when wealth comes. The issue with this latter is that it involves very little doing. It is ironic that the path here is suspectedly more enjoyable than the place they reach, and moreso do they wish there was still somewhere else to go once they have reached there - for upon reaching that end, they are unsettled by their new lack of ambition.
   <br>&emsp;The resolve here is one that lacks maturity in the success of their aim, but rests similarly to those who are mature, in that each is really focused on what they are doing. To this one who is occupied, their interest and care is spent actively and pleasingly; the difference is that it is driven by wealth and future gains. The ignorance is purely the fact that once those motivations are met, more will need to take its place. Nothing is ever worth the promise besides the draw it places on you, helming you to act substantially, of which is the truest gain. The mature person sees this, reverently. They poise themselves into this kind of conduct, ignoring the faulty promises, but actually addressing and confiding in the prominence of good there is in actual living. They define what this means as joy, measures the stretch of experiencing it as being generous, and deliberately aims for the abundance of this claim so that by their end a good amount of full living will have been gained. "Which they can reflect on happily, in knowing that they've lived."
</div>
<div id="onwork">
   I have made a grand distinction, though, I may not be able to define it. It starts a like this. Work is meant to seep provisions. These are proceeds towards your claim, the gain of which is in how you spend your time. The metric of that use is joy; we’ll say merely, that this reflects where you live the most. Joy then, is the demand for those who are living; moreso does it presume that your wish is to do so well.
   <br>&emsp;Something I truly believe and have fully experienced is that this desire needs very little to proceed; not only do the demands of effort require little more than the wisdom of your choices, but, moreso and my point, that the vessel and case for things that draw you to aspire -in your industry and production- are not only abundant but limited in what you really need. What we are doing, is simply creating something from nothing by throwing ourselves in -to something thought of and designed. “Where we are inspired is through all that surrounds us. That world and its glory is what we see and define; this fashions a mold for our tribute, wherein we earn the reward of full engagement.” The sum of this accounts for how much we’ve lived.
   <br>&emsp;Life pulls us though and regularly brings us out of line with this sort of path. Especially, is this the case through misfortune. “As those in peril have little room to consider their wellness.” For example though, I say quite confidently that even if you were in a dungeon, dripping with blood, dread and grit, still could you mend this by your nature to inquire. For you could address that there still sat goodness around, or simply the fact that by these more horrid means or not, you were still mortal. By remedying ourselves against those scenarios, or contrary traits for that matter, so to can we remain with our heads up high and placed towards the gain of living. “Or least can we remember the beauty elsewhere in the world, which serves even those who are now blinded.” As it stands, our aim of joy and abundance will come as long as we can act on the good that we see. In terms of what we have, this is what can be corroded, by those troubles or ignorant stupidity. If we are well kept, and otherwise placed away from the latter, then so too will our aims be set towards that vibrancy and color. And remember, that in any place you can conspire against the forces of nature, to see her as beauty and love. “No matter the trouble she throws at us, so to can we be true to what she is in the way of.” In keeping that direction in mind, can we persevere past her bindings, or avoid them by setting ourselves outside more common troubles. Still, we must find a basic agreement with her, as to align ourselves to be congruent and efficient amidst the tempests of her darker side. “It is the ill wisdom of folks which drowns them amidst nature and her task, as they are ignorant to both her ways, and thus what she asks. Consequently, we bear neither any confidence of right approach, or the actual claim.” If our choice is otherwise effective, then so will our industry and creativity flourish. “Wherein life and joy is our gain.”
</div>
<div id="joy">
   Let us clarify our life position; it goes as follows. We are trying to live well, and this means being generous. This is best described as involvement in activity and craft, prolifically and industriously. On the former, this we'll regard as an abundance in your effort; to the latter, an ingenuity in the way you spend your time. The reason these attributes are in line with living well is in the bedrock of contribution. Being generous, or rather the stream of contribution, merely reflects the act of enjoyment.
   <br>&emsp;Joy is the measure of your involvement, rooted in the ease and relishment of the experience. Enjoyment is the sum of a duration, and in effect, is generous when the effort is aimed at 'some' thing and through 'some' craft. "The things that draw us the most are those which interest us, pulling us with ease, to which we happily contribute." Living well then, is defined as the amount of generosity, or enjoyment, that is stacked throughout your life.
   <br>&emsp;My feeling is that in doing so, you will have lived the right life, for it was one set and deliberate towards the aim of living. This aim then, is fully met when you are consistent in the experience that increases the sum of joy. In that, it is the regularity of your contribution that marks the riches of this time.
   <br>&emsp;That contribution is best spent and largely so, when it is prolific and industrious. For example, if you love to paint, then the abundance of strokes and creative employment marks the prolific trait within the activity. If you love literature and are keen on making a reference, then the ingenious and resourceful design in arranging and conveying the bounty of information that has your eye, reflects the industry in your effort.
   <br>&emsp;It is also worth noting the frequency and thus gain of these kinds of efforts. If contribution is marked in size through the abundance of expression, and creativity in design, this we'll say is the highest measure. Similar though, to a marathon run once in a while, the effects of generosity eventually wain as your contribution fails. "It does not matter how much income you make if your spending remains and the additions fail." Your life is forever when it comes to you. The demand then for this life to be living is in the consistency of the gains that fill it. It is true that if you have a wonderful stretch of time, even a lacking will be held up from the radiance that followed. That light will begin to fade though, as will the consequences of non-living come into place. However, seeing as this sort of color isn't too appealing, our natural draw from the prior state of saturation will surely call out as a point to return to. "If the lacking prevails otherwise, so will your time feel the same."
</div>
<div id="generosity">
   The paramount line of our life is contribution. I strictly mean where you are generous with your time: there you are living. "living the most then can be regarded as the reach of your generosity." Being generous can be tough though. A dilemma is caused though on whether or not this should be the case. On one hand, you can be successful and leveled in your way, allowing you to work more. On the other hand, you may gain little in terms of stability from your efforts, relying on the satisfaction your generosity gives in order to make provisional efforts worthwhile. I think that something should be clarified in order to understand this dynamic. Simply, your work is not meant to produce anything more than the joy and room to do so. There's this crass integrity which says that audiences and impact make the effort worthwhile - for it generates more satisfaction. I find this is folly. If we really are interested in being generous, then we will seek the rewards that give us that.
   <br>&emsp;Something to distinguish then is the nature of the work you do and what warrants it. It is the case that a personal vocation rests in all of us, of which we can privately and happily do. We may have alternative interests and crafts that draw us outside this but feel warranted only by the collaboration and exposure to others. Photography is a great example for me. At its core, it isn't something I would be satisfied in doing personally; perhaps by its purely visual nature it is something that gravitates towards sharing, but it simply isn't something I would do on my own. I would like to do it however, but here our point is contained. Everyone who wishes to be industrious and prolific seeks a reason to do so. Whether it is the involvement of others who will see or simple freedoms that you have gained, allowing you to be irreverent to the impact. This line is what we are trying to understand. As an artist, my vocation is writing, design, and study. These molds us through the world as me: no one knows though. I don't seek their attention for my own need - I am very satisfied currently. It is merely the confusion between things I would do if I had the time, and my expectation that what I do and who I am, primarily, will earn me that necessarily.
   <br>&emsp;Something to clarify is the notion of good things and their expectations. It isn't the case that appreciation and subsidy ought not to be sought from your efforts; it's just the case that your great developments don't demand or guarantee a spotlight and reward. This is the problem and thing to extinguish. Our effort is not barred from its substance, but the reward is not a centering on you. It is quite possible, acceptable at least, that the greatest thing earns little notoriety. My resolve though is to recognize what being notable is for. I wish to be generous and industrious. On the latter, this describes efforts that are rooted in collaboration and being prolific. The freedom required to do so is where the notoriety is mixed in, as if it will provide. And it is not as if it wouldn't, but is it so easy to acquire? I would say no. Moreso, I would call it unnecessary. Pointedly, the line is from us. The production along this way is barred simply by the limit of our substance, preventing us from adding more. My question then is where you would have enough to add something considerable. It may not be the means in which you seek, but rather the results of steady use from a stronger team, or self. If there were a group contributing, then it could reach a size where its foundation was worth solidifying, wherein you could add to it. I think this is the way, compared to starlight intentions.
   <br>&emsp;I concede proudly to the little I need to proceed to a lot, but I sink a little in my composure at the notion of further solitude. I have some trust in the proliferation of our efforts to meet that threshold, along with the natural draw of others to join our trajectory and add to the construction - be it from online exposure or personal invitation(from work let's say). I simply am trying to understand the place for my ambition in producing something spectacular, but avoiding the concern and draw of a profit or reward. At heart, I believe the motivation lies in the softness of your core, in which you shift around a little too awkwardly and see the road as a struggle because it is personal, and you feel off. "As I am beginning to find, being steady with this will make lift your hopes and please you, in the spot your in right now; as such engagement usually amounts to adding more steps. And is that not what is satisfying?"
</div>
<div id="positivity">
   If being happy is truly the meaning of our lives, what does it exactly mean? The reason I ask is that aspiration can dread one into feeling like their current happiness, or sought-after satisfaction is not enough. I would say definitively that things don’t make the mold; they are what fit the measure. Moreso, would I relish that metric, and say it was to be a flourishing, regularly. Reaching for that then fully and to its heart permits the removal of remission from its settlement and victory. “Insisting on something other to be sought is not necessary.”
   <br>&emsp;I really don’t think we have much more than the time on our hand and its interests to enjoy. Nourishing that, as to draw yourself into and towards those things which compel you to contribute, prompts the question of whether these things are not enough for living to be claimed. The question for a mature one, is to the nature of these interests, and their presence within the strength of your craft; if you are able to contribute more, and into trails of higher interest, should more base ones which are exciting and tumultuous be regretful outside of their obtainment? I think harshly not. If the measure truly is a worthwhile experience, then we must rest on the laurels of things having their place and time with respect to those wholesome ways.
   <br>&emsp;If our values are of a kind, then the real question is whether or not they are misplaced - or mistaken rather. Where I begin with that consideration, is the principle of positivity; it says that ‘regardless of one’s claim, be it from theology, sadism, industry, drunkenness or fame, the goal and thus aim, is at least the gain of a measure which is positive’. My feeling is that the real question for reason and philosophy is what then is most positive. On one side, whatever it is would in fact command us to act in an appropriately astute way. This gives merit to the fact that stealing, for example, is no good in itself, and is thus not a demand of any good aim. The difficulty though is in determining why it is deemed poor before we have the end in mind. “As I have discovered, those criteria, or determinants of good rather, must come from assessing who we are and what we wish to be. Then, all actions and goals can administer themselves with respect to that.”
</div>
<div id="demands">
   The world cries out in response to my prompt, to be treated in a certain way or kind. What I receive is the price. Considering what the request is that I place, the demands by that which giveth is relatively small. So much so, that I have begun to describe each and nearly every post as 'accommodations'. Clearly speaking, I say provisions (and your needs thus) are meant for you to live. The offer then of what provides is simply to do that: to give the ground for you to enjoy. I regard those efforts as accommodative, as however varied they are, their mean is toward a living which is universal. "From thievery or business, I seek freedom and joy."
   <br>&emsp;I seek joy and gratitude, consistently and true. This is the aim of all posts: and they are all equal at giving so. That living though is what is hard to define. Through the theory of hunch, only so much can be known; yet I imagine that regardless of our uncertainty to how things are, we can at least grapple with and parse what there is - whether or not we know what it means. I see at some point a total understanding of our very reflection as we become more aware of who we are and thus where we are set to be. We were born out of something very small, into a world that has solidified, bearing us. Our very nature to inquire leads to the address of us, and what that suggests we're congenial towards. The problem is that from the path of simpler times, these complicated times feel less integrated, and consequently, I feel like we're fighting our baser ambitions, thwarting them against our base of reason. The two feel contradictory. I must further confess to the irreverence I have to others' folly, but the shame I have placed in their ignorant requests. They have built their impression and resolve - and thus lovingly give such advice - on the basis of those base ambitions; there is no respect or embellishment of our truest and greatest selves; there is no gain from or make to that. And I reason that the very cause of this is in a lack of insight itself. "It is only from the recognition I have of being an agent, that I see the lineage and time thats lead to this point, where that tendency and care was absent."
   <br>&emsp;I am unsure what to do, even if I have seen the righteousness of our gain. The conflict and stress rises from the embers of past ambitions, mixing with the stabilities gained from personal attention and care. I feel so much more comfortable and staunch since I started taking care of myself and settling in. Maybe that thing we were interested in before can be worked towards, with this new strength. I say this then as I have said before now, that the fielty to our aim banishes the rust from that bedrock, to those who would seek proper alignment and the consequently sought rewards; this is what must be done for us to put out the fire. For if we do not act from outside the memory of lust, then that attention will be as turned around towards such vice, and vanity will be our only gain.

   More and more do the tides run clearer, showing me their way, treating me with insight to the nature of the the shore; In that, they show me; to it though, I see our path and claim
   <br>&emsp;If I were to have a little, I could still be alot. With only a slight something though, that being is uncomfortable and, in that respect, restrained. It does not stop me though; I have seen the way in which we'd prosper from this simpler time; in being so though, I feel less clear on the route to its success, and thus remain in our gentle mind. I like it there, am pleased by it - for it is wholesome, - but I do see that a richer and more robust kind of experience, sits outside my door. "I fear not the sword, or the animals. Rather, I am ill proposed to foolish joys or ambition, and I do not quite know where I'd like to go, where if I could not return or stray to another, in that I would not appose." whichever that place is though, and whatever is rooted and sprout from its way, is coming. We are in this place which once held grit and flame; now we are trying to roast an existence on this fire, one which is more regualar and of nourishment. For some time, I felt as though our natural path would take us away, to a place in which we were valuable and seen; It is merely extending the walls though; I am still not outside.

<div id="freedom">
   If we were free, it would be to write, train, practice and inquire. Around this, there swims a plethora of opportunity for further support and interest. The core of us though is bound through our stake. Philosophy suggests the world's kind, and proposes that we entrench ourselves in the proper resolve. Doing so brings me to fear, for why is there so much yet I feel so not? My suspicion is that you are not treating the aim of your inquiry with the reverence and effect that equals the truth you found. Furthermore, I will add this point of free time, and our consideration of that and its worth. Normally, I find that my efforts to discover and explore are pure and abundant. "Little is left over but rest". What's worth noting though, is the nature of our youth and adolescence. Is it not the case that working enough to provide your time yields the rest for the industrious and or explorative use of it? It may feel as though those grander claims are overfilling (the bottle, so to speak), but is this not the way and period for those cultivating themselves; would the maturing and realization of that offer, be the point in which the ground was wider and solid? isn't it acceptable to reach a fortune of that kind then?
   <br>&emsp;Moreso, would I say that the reticence to work and progress is folly when it comes to having a friendship, increasing room for contributions, efficiency in work or the prosperous and or fortune to travel and be seen: are these not the means to more kinds of generous effort? Is the goal here, not to reach a point where things of a kind are on offer for you to entrench in? If so, then respecting that more youthful and developing stage, cherish the rooted and heartfelt interests and desires of one who has just seen the light; obviously much more has been seen, and old tempers and inclinations remain, but the shoot and seekings of this uplifted man, are they not worth the embellishment and firmness to treat? I'll end on the note and distinction, that it isn't that those future and fortuned gains of interest and craft are not worthwhile, or better yet worth seeking because they are not fundamental; what I would say strictly, is that their worth is only unique in the kind that they are. As vessels and grounds to be generous, their place is equal and of the same, as those purer interests; what must be said and concerned about with those, is equal to these of a fortuned kind. Our place then in valuing so is right and set for a current and immediate address, for it is the kindness of all that meet and base themselves in being a room to tribute, then this is the proper and welcomed way to be.

   To quote Montaigne, “my ambition here is not to tell you the measure of things, rather my view of them.” What I seek is a tremendous expression of the material under that lens; by our industry and creative approach, ‘I mean to express the impression truly found in me’.
   <br>&emsp;The world and its stage can be described amidst the universe - its saga known to. Our place in all of this has the lens of inquiry to consider it all. Applicable to these grounds are principles, narratives of worldly events -like the Russian revolution, or the fall of Rome- summaries of great people and insights of people’s fruitful workings. “Things I have happily grown to hold.” Simply, I wish to place my time and care onto these things. Then, I wish to paint that world as I see it, in the most abundant and personal way. “I see the workings of philosophy, the firmness of the greats, the heritage and sequence of our planet and time, but it is my own tribute that bears a pursuit of expression and design.”
   <br>&emsp;In another light, my attempts here are not to ft the foot to the shoe, or mistake the trees for the forest; I am simply trying to make a garden, an orchard. And I have chosen the fruitings and seeds that will make the color and beauty of those greens and these pastures as lively and heartfelt as I seek. The world is what draws me; in response, I treat it with reverence, generosity and care. I merely wish to arrange the bits that intrigue me onto the canvas in a way in which my craftmanship seeks and settles into. In treating things in a way in which I am wishful and free in the highest of ways to be, is where I am fully living. The route for my love of wisdom, matter and Ryan, is found through this draw that I have to such beauty in the world, and richness to. The gifts of an Architect, are such that they would treat their reverence with such formative abundance. “Wherein the towers we made as tribute could not reach high enough.”

<div id="living">
   What satisfies me the most is the knowledge that whatever the circumstance, our aim remains. In our current state, I feel quite dull and apprehensive; our make for stability within our present scenario is progressing with positivity, but only initially, as it then holds me in suspense as time goes on. I know however, that if and when the tide turns our way, or even it is removed or simply delayed, that my gain and claim from such stability does not change, and thus I will rest and settle in, as if our time now and then is the same.
$Happyand Free
   <br>&emsp;I must clarify on top of that, to attributes that are given any sort of claim. My point before is that regardless of claim, it should at least be consistent in the result you seek; moreso, should it be reliable and substantial in the reward. These traits seem acceptable to our stake. Whether it is cruelty, faith, industry or fame, the positive gain is absolutely best when it is regular and sound. That being said, we can use reason to discern the space around, and see its nature with respect to me. The desire for pain or pleasure is not cut and clear, but that something is pleasant, or that it hurts, is generally objective. Whatever it is that we truly seek, it is safe to say that at the very least, if it is frequent in its offer, and positive in what you seek, then we will say that is good.
   <br>&emsp;It just seems to me though, that certain things better fit the bill, as reason can sharply disclose. For example, sex, drugs, glory and treats, these things are satisfying; you may like this or desire that, but in what manner can they be obtained? It seems that for things in these cases, only the things themselves can prompt satiety; when they are gone so is that feeling, and they return to being sought. Compare that to reading a short essay and the foundedness that sticks throughout you, even when the piece no longer remains.
   <br>&emsp;This sort of thinking is what reason provides, for it tells and clears the way for things to be known in and of themselves. As ones who are thinking, those impressions are likely with respect to us, though still, the result for us is merely a relation to the rooted nature of the thing we are dealing with; case in point, hot water causes burns, but also causes steam to rise from cooler waters; what reason does, is assess and determine the nature of water; as a faculty though, its mix amongst other things melds it into the consensus of that nature being a certain way, as it is with relation to us. Put another way, our determination of something poisonous may be that it holds properties and parts that give it a certain expression; our impression though may be onto this foremost nature, saying what it is effectively to us, in that it is toxic - whereas to rock it may not be, but the substance’s essence and makeup remain.
   <br>&emsp;To return to our heading point, the aim of those wishing to live well can be described best in things that they are doing; at least, we can say that some ‘thing’ is being done, be it of art, entertainment or pure nothingness. Any experience of sorts. What I would say with finality, is that onto a particular thing, one experience will be more positive. I say this based on the nature of things and the nature of the subject; it is likely that a harmony can exist, and thus should be worked towards, for there the best experience is claimed. Referencing our previous points, the nature of ourselves is found through the same means as those of things around us; reason can say what a thing is and what a thing does; in that, we can say and clarify what it is and who we are, and thus, consider and assess what will fit this lane. I feel then, however rumbled my explanation has been, that an objective truth can be discerned about the way one ought to be. Moreover, would I say that any impossibility in knowing one or another’s essence, or being somewhat ineffective in our capable assessment, simply means that the objectivity is not well rounded; it is crisp and jagged though of the soundness shape. “In that I see, that the figure and seems of man, is pure in heart and green.”
</div>
<div id="clear">
   If your generosity and care truly marks the measure of expression and joy, then the amount and sincerity in which you materialize this accounts for the soundness way. Be it in family or trades, the world or some craft, our life is so when we are involved in it, throwing ourselves in. "This is where our hearts and minds are rich and bold." We must be resolute to this condition, that if it was to be in lack for some reason, then our defense and installment of success towards the issue had our roots of attention and resolve. Firmly and true, is that rot of living found in ill-defined notions and ways of where it is settled. If we know not where to look, then we will have no sound or effective reach for it, and instead we'll have wasted our time. If living truly is our claim, then the means to that reflects the most necessary condition that is worth and in demand of our respect. If living is what means and draws us the most, then the reason for its success is what is foremost in the value of its development; equally and in contrast, would the ways and efforts that bound us outside of this, be as worthwhile to avoid.
   <br>&emsp;That being said, if we are clear and set to the statement that 'life is lived most and well when we are placed and met in the actual living' has any claim of truth, then the proceeds should continue as follows. If we are to participate, then we should be completely able to -for we will otherwise not do so well. If the reason to participate is constant in its demands so that our aim is met, then so to should our actual interest be held on to. This is because without a target, then no attempt will be made. Instead, if we mold ourselves towards some favorable end, then so to can our actions align. "If the root and trunk of us is clear and set onto what we really seek, then both the means of doing so and our actual success in reaching it, will be higher and subsequent, flourishing to -and would that not be and satisfy us as the furthest gain."
$TheAim of Living
   <br>&emsp;As I say, we are making something from nothing. The good times that are treating us now are only relevant as you make use of them. No longer and no more do I or will I set myself towards the ease and offerings dealt to us as if glory and praise will surely come. It is true fortune that we have been given, for it is out of the blue and uncommon. Assumed as it may be, or as expected, believing so with surety will not hold true, for even if it were all yours and made for you to hold as a definite claim, you still would not be living the most. “And that recognition that we are so well off but making no use of it, is what feels both alarming and dreadful.”
   <br>&emsp;The most boring notion - as it is the first point of wisdom, and thus for children - is that gifts and sharp offerings are but mere contributions to the true and necessary craft and development for that which yields the greatest claim. These good times are set for you to demonstrate and hone yourself, as to reach and find the sprouting pasture that holds the key to your flourishing way. It is that labor and consistency that will treat you to the soundest offerings, as you are given the room and means to particiapte - which the gain of living requires. That freedom that you have is so that you can and are encouraged to be and embellish your truest self. It cannot be forgotten though, that the way here is no shorter of effort than is required for what is aimed at pleasures and fame; rather, it is a course set on you grandly and happily participating, be it in your craft, your roles and duties, or the reflections and treats in and from your mind. These processes and development are born from and nourished by a stance and resolve that is resolute to the constance and integrity demanded by the maker of a regular flourishing. “That chest is the world and its grandeur; it is its beauty our ability and sense to treat it that draws us to throw ourselves in and marry its tasks, thus making it our stake; in doing so, we are bound and committed to the industry and assemblance of the routine expedition and relishment that requires us so we can maintain the key, and forever feast on the offer behind the door.” Very simply, will that entrance slam shut to those who lack the firmness and strength to turn the lock, and bolt it tight for later - so nothing good slips outside. The crafted and rigorous life is this one where we live the most, ‘for our greatest gain is the one from our living’. It is the treatment we give to the world, when generous and rich with abundance, that our heart and soul feels as imminent and large as would be the case for those being the most. “It is that great and magnificent capacity that describes and boldens us to be: we must simply hold the stake, or aim of this rather.”
</div>
<div id="care">
   Considerably, I would inquire to the ends of your time, as did reflect that nature that you supposed. If it were so, would the limit of your nature not suggest that it would come to an end? And if so, how would any action be considered sound and congruent, if this were truly the case yet you did not know? My criticisms are not bound here on your poor choices or use of time. I am merely declaring that because you lack thought into what you are doing, then you lack any reason for doing so - because without any thorough consideration, then no measure for why could be made. "And lacking such insight does not generally fair well for this who would otherwise wish to meet a target."
   <br>&emsp;As one who spends their time alone, my effort is barred within the lines of stable living. In other words, my fortunes rise little but sink little as well; their place around me is minor, as my position is nestled between the utmost simplicity - so I can be myself. In contrast to this, is a common way; in this manner, one's time is more variable, with respect to family, work and friends. This way of living has more stability through its sustenance - as work and relationships provide- whereas the personal path offers little in the plains ahead. On that latter though, do the times remain firm and consistent, moving as a continued stretch into future plots of duration; the former in contrast, has much more that is seen ahead, but pulls you away from being set and at ease within a single place. Moreover, does living in an outwardly way, regardless of how much, take you out of living immediately and for yourself; on the flip side, being completely on your own beckons a lack of insight to the future and what it will bring - for no effort there is being made. Moreso, do you lack the support to and comfort to consider it. "You are merely well and kept in yourself; but in this way you are at best happy with the present, rather than looking ahead." What I find though, is that in each case, the good on offer is similar. Whereas the single way is narrow yet firm, and the invested life bears more of a stretch, both can treat you to an equal amount of gains. "In that, does reaching a place where there is more fortune and friends appease me not, as it ends up treating me the same; moreover, do I not grieve our lacking of it nor our present case of solitude: for in that I am merely set within the greens of ourself." And personally, I find those fruits more whole and lasting.
</div>
<div id="solid">
   I am fortunate when things are well. Principally, I overcome things that do not go our way. In other words, I relish and greet posativity, and rise above negativity: This describes and defines the nature of our way. Its target though is beyond the state of the ground. In this land, our generous participation will yeild an active joy; if it is regular and abundant, then we will have a flourishing on our hands. The vessels and crafts which hold these means to tribute vary in applicability for our offer, for two reasons: One is simply having something to give; when we do, our ability to give more accumulates, and the standard by which things draw is more level - compared to the lofty heights of some who require the sun to spin and dance, or at the very least swoon them away. I on the other hand, as a man ripe with interest, can be tributive and pleased to our own very nature - the many things and beings in the world no less. In addition, will the buffet and openeness for our selection, reflect our prosperity. Put another way, if we have more than ourselves to contribute, then we will have more substantiall means to be generous. "It is no less meaningfull to reflect and attest to your nature and time when compared to extravegence and beauty, but the latter offers more room neccessarily, along with being more accepting of any sorts of effort. You on the other hand, will have a more dense and developing state by which your sights can materialze. Moreso, will they bank on the ability and strenght gained from everyday decisions; rollercosters and thrills merely ask that you show up."
</div>
<div id="strenght">
   All I have is our sense and those things which I see. In doing so, my place is met and made in the ways of one who knows only what they can, and are as such satisfied with the proper workings of that. "To all else that I do not know, my interest bears no claim. For that which is in my sight or grasp, the arrangement fairs me well when congruence is rooted deep in that." When I lose, I fall back on our aim. From our unsure bearings and consequent haze, those things which I do have hold me nicely. My friends and family, my strength, obligations that bear fortune as well as the ease which I am provided for through congenial roles, these are pleasing and comforting in times of stress or the unknown. "For at least they are there."
   <br>&emsp;What I have though is marked in place which seems unsure. Whether it is enough or is truly admittable in contrast to our struggles around, sees me beyond appreciation. As a response, I have begun to treat myself to the courage of seeking our own self, whereby we settle into our most positive response. Only there we are, and thus can gain, wherein we were made, onto those things no longer with me; then I fall back onto our aim, bringing me to that place where anything lesser merely pulls me from a point where it is known, that none but I am O.K - and only there have I the absolute claim.
   <br>&emsp;Simply put, when I, my aims, my fortunes and trust are enough, no part of me can be taken or slain, nor will the world and its good, or evil, earn anything from me other than my interest and admiration. "For that, I am ok."
$Theedge of worry lies in the remission from concern; its shadow remains though as you still try to explain and relieve the previous despair. In other words, you improve, finding yourself better off and more happily set; but the issues that were previous still linger, like an attack that promises to strike again. It is the impression of that stalking, that has you reassuring yourself to the good in this moment. The issue arises and is prominent, in the joy and rest in which your new position actually has. It may be the case that past concerns are no longer a threat due to your new fortune, but the worry is only what derails: the problem is still of concern, and you are merely relieved to be outside of its way. The point in which I would advise is that you engender yourself with reason and rationality, as to remove and avoid the actual presence of problems; foremostly, will this allow your care and strength be able to be turned and tuned to more freeing and liberal ways; moreso and with caution, do I suspect that if the problem still prevails, then the worry will soon follow. In your current stead, the issue is present but dealt with. Being out of range of this threat does not remove the lions from Africa though, and when the time arrives in which you are not so set, the worry and fear will bubble up, stressing you out like a wolf's howl in the distance.
   <br>&emsp;It is the removal of assumptions and filling of your mind with true reason and care, that the threats that would otherwise keep you shed off into a more applicable realm. You as a man or woman need regard for the limits within your life, and how you spend your time; it is not the case that true concerns are without any need of regard, but holding onto yourself and possessions is separate from the most rooted concerns. Whichever problem one actually has, let us know that they are simple and small. We are not under threat from bears and sharks, merely the idleness and greed from ourselves. It is not the case that things will not be stolen, or that we will remain forever with fortune and our lives; but we must know that this is understandable and that we can trust ourselves to be formidable. By removing the notion of what is unnecessary, we will not be distraught or with disdain in the presence or expectation that things and fortune will be taken; if that notion is rid of, then we will only have fear and worry about how we use and treat ourselves. Secondly, will the removal of these faulty claims and aspirations settle us into the possibility of more positive and rewarding interests.
   <br>&emsp;As ones who are limited, our time is naturally spent as to fully and consistently express and realize the best we have within ourselves. Our role is not to rule and gain as if we will live and be forever: we are mortal, and simply to that is where, and in what we should be. By assessing ourselves, we can be strong and spry; efficiently and sound from that, can we apply ourselves, wherein joy and cheer are earned from our generosity and interest. From these actions, will we reach the end having lived and dealt with our condition posatively. What this requires, as a seel to this hatch, is the reverence and care to know this is true, and thus hold ourselves foremost and forwardly, wherein we can prosper and fair.
</div>
<div id="withouttrouble">
   As ones then who are well set, but still unsure what to do, my advice is to straighten up and firm the foresight onto what we passively know. If death is what we internally see, then I would remedy the risks of leaving the clarity of it unchecked; in other words, if you don't define and prescribe the notion of how you should be until death, then that baser experience of sensing present threats will not be able to settle, missing out on the advantage it has on truly sitting beside the risk of anything happening at all. Simply said, if the mind which can sense danger does not have a rounded aim of what it knows is guaranteed, and thus expected, then the lack of danger will still see that you know not what to do. Effectively then, the free time you have is not fully spent.
   <br>&emsp;Because the grip you have that is born from the shaft of your mind is lacking, angst and trepidation will follow. This is because without any presence of actual threats, the inability to proceed with respect to the world when positive reflects the fact that you do not know what to do. That knowledge is carried foremost by the marbling of an ultimate threat, from death, that you know is coming as a guarantee -just not now. The mind surely does not know what to do if this were not the case: its nature developed to avoid that which is coming, only it was raised in a way in which this avoidance was imminent and rooted in quick reactions - rather than acceptance of a final promise.
   <br>&emsp;It is easy and known how to respond to a present threat: you run, jump or hide, quickly and with haste. If there is no risk to our scenario, how then should we proceed? I think that perhaps the point must be intuited, by the example of that which wastes our time is known obviously and anxiously felt, yet we are not clear on how and why we are mortal. It may be the case that if time were long lasting and forever, gluttony and tears would be permissible; I say though with respect to our initial suggestion, that this point be drawn sharply, however imperfect the shape in which we'd draw is. For we know for certain that we will die, and that knowing this is the revelation which yields us the truth, in that we can then know where and how to go, since we are familiar and thus able to express that our time is limited. "Proceeding from that, we must gracefully and sincerely sip from the stream."
</div>
<div id="mind">
   Clarity of statement is the finest thing for it gives bearing to your judgment, and thus acts as a means for better assessment. I will relate something if I can. In a pre-sifted aim, I see the world ahead through the eyes and mind of one stripped of ambition; as a forward creature who uses reason to explore and define, and bears a nature and compulsion that motivates the gain, I am sure of the uncertainty and partial brittleness to the attempt. The reason, as follows, runs the line of a process, in which one has begun to replace old ambitions with new ones, and is furthering those aims instead. The demonstration of this more rounded and worthwhile way sees the leveling of effort required, for the gains were brought by nature and congruence; the subtle alignments and complexion that changed in order to bring these offerings, were simple and pure, allowing for a smooth obtainment; moreso, when you do reach this claim from maturity, you not only sit with it, easily and with rest, but you see unobstructed interests and gains beyond and further ahead. The area in which I'd inquire is to the gaze that is set, and which horizon you truly see; if your aims are born from stronger roots, then the ambitions will surely follow; my notice though has been to the nature of these views, and whether they are ambition; I find that without the removal of uncertainty, or the upheaving of feeling less than all, than any aim of fortune or venture is minute. "The aim of those inside maturity is a continued reach and gain from being themselves." Searching inward, I relish this mixing of aims by the recognition and embellishment of the world's positivity, that from a point in which all sought is born and found through me, that I am steadfast and secure based on the sensibility and firmness of that. "If I, cannot be moved, then none who would move me have any claim to my response and treatment of the world, and thus her gain."
   <br>&emsp;Sometimes though, I impede myself; this state is not permanent, or consistent even, but I do notice its arrival from time to time, and however much I do see the remnants of the old riches outweighing the current toxicities, my aim and forwardness bears towards certainty and being all. What I believe and resolve from this particular experience, is that the state of goodness and ease brings on itself without strictness and heft; furthermore, and to the point, is the nature of one who is mature realizes that 'they' are maturing; the remedy of this is to materialize and cherish the fidelity for this evolving process, and hearing its model of impermanence and shakiness; "what I have seen is that if my aim is not one of gurantees, then the means by which I generate a development, need not be for so, and thus it to can nestle in and set itself towards the state of development: It takes the day off naturally when I am flourishing, for it as reason has done its job, and I can regularly and perpetually carry my way; she merely showed me how."
</div>
<div id="memories">
   Memories play a strong role in remedying stress. Looking back on the past, I see how the future seems bright moving forward; foremost is the notion that previous mistakes are no longer being made and, moreso, do current fortunes and prominences of satisfaction feel more substantial. In this, you can reap the rewards of your own trajectory. Forewardly, the aims of the past have materialized into the claims of the present; in seeing that, one can be reassured that more will come which is good, and less will appear which is bad. Particularly and to my point, when you have reflected on what trail you have left, will you be shown the improving steps that have come from the steps before. From that, memory is profitably known.
   <br>&emsp;Generally speaking, this kind of inquiry leads me to a place in which certainty is unpacked and I look for a route forward based on strength. Here, however, I see the nature of our class, wherein its set is rooted in the essence of being one who inquires, and thus my clarity and rest is well founded through the strength I have in demonstrating this way. Better said, as one who thinks and inquires, leaving the inspection of what that means and, equally, what I would venture to propose, becomes less necessary when I am more congenial to the medium of thinking. In a similar way to one who achieves a victory or reward, the foundedness and feeling of being set, seeps in and takes me naturally, as I have met my way. Understandably then, if thinking well is the virtue within my expression, then doing so well will be evident equal to my awareness of the task. In other words, as much of a grasp as I have of being a thinker, or rather one of the intellect, then the use of this well will reveal itself as a measure of congruence within the demands marked by the nature of the medium; moreso and to my point, will rich and proper thought seem prominently good and truthfully meritable with respect to the sharp use and embellishment of our foremost way. Case in point, would my use of attention and care be less satisfactory if it were spent towards gluttony and deceit; these things may be fine, but evidently, at least, feel in contrast and thus opposed by the strong and rational mind. On that latter, be it the true foundation, or at least the thing which seems worthwhile to seek, then the gains of that will equally be met when the treatment of our time and energy is made from the tribute and demonstration of it.
   <br>&emsp;As one who is rational and clear, the actions and time spent from this lane (so to speak) will be most rewarding. As a thief whose profitable and at home through connivery, or a priest who is sound through his charity and faith, the work and admittance of rational actions and deeds, is what will please and ingratiate the mind that is rational, and thus earn you an experience filled with generosity and ease. "As one who is born and with nature to inquire."
</div>
<div id="thegrey">
   When I am older, I will die. This is principally because I am limited, am a living thing, and have known all others alike, to reach and meet the same. How I know this for sure, is that my certainty lacks only the knowledge of the absolute. I believe it follows that if my limits were not in place, then to each and all I could know. The very fact though that there is and seems to be a place and grain for inquiry, suggests that I am not full and complete. It is the attempt then, and our fielty in being able and tasked with doing so, that draws us forth wholeheartedly and staked towards the end of one who is as such(limited). Having a resolve then is tricky, as I am not completely sure what to base it on. If my actions give repercussions after death for example, my efforts may be placed regarding this, whereas if they are not and I am merely subject to nature and here way, then my aims will orient themselves with that in mind.
   <br>&emsp;The Philosopher is one who makes additions to our understanding of what rests outside the mold. Moreover, does a man take what he has, and bring himself from the ground up, reaching at least to some sort of height -however unknown the end may be. To that, I have found that both sentiments are co-operatively demonstrated over the course of each of their uses. Put another way, as you mature by addressing your actions and time, the question and worry of what lies further beyond becomes more prominent. "It's as if by becoming so sound and pronounced, that your gaze sets further ahead; the haze and mist blurs the far off destination though: that is the Grey."
   <br>&emsp;In that case, the Man will proceed with confidence; necessarily, this is the case because he is unsure -and in some primal way afraid. Moreso, he is in need -and astute consequently- for demonstrating courage and strength 'as he makes forward, towards a place unknown'. Additionally though, will this person of attention and care, also set his pretensions about what is unknown into an orderly and reputable fashion. "As mentioned, the Man will not know everything, but he can at least know this and admit it without feeling scarcity." It is easy to feel safe and sound when nothing is there(or suspected) that merits any alarm. What happens when you see and are treated to the world in all its fullness; better yet, the whole and vastness of existence and entirety? There are surely things in there that are uncommon and legitimate in making us scared or afraid: the Man is simply one who bears the load, and pushes forth despite the worry. "Here, he is carried by courage and strength, not certainty and remission of the concern."
   <br>&emsp;Anyways, the point I wished to illustrate is that although the Man can proceed into the fray, and moreso can he admit that his treatment will be unknown, he can still employ his ability to consider and inquire. In other words, if he can see the path ahead but not what lies around the corner, then his regard can at least be towards something which seems most likely, if not probable. "A fear of ghouls and dragons is no fair claim, for even if nothing expected is known, we can at least be sure that what occurs will be in the realm of what's possible." It is from the base of that notion, that simple reflection and care can be placed by the man onto the common happenings of the world; moreso, can he reflect on other people's experience through first hand storytelling, or impressions left by books or some other form of craft. "The David tells so much; someone made this, suggesting their nature to do so. The complexity and figure of the make reflect the persistence and interest of the sculptor, furthering our base understanding of what the environment must have been around -It cannot be the case that this or any great piece of art was built in combat, or with the support and aims of foolishness or war. Moreso, can we see who the worker was of, in kind that is. In clearly seeing such things in this way, so to can we find comfort in the whole -for we see the scope of its nicer elements. "
   <br>&emsp;These impressions from others, or the simple experience you have been dealt with first hand, make way for what the world is in the commons. When you see that there is so much that has been offered, can you really be afraid of anyone built and made of a similar kind? And besides that, can we at least say that the vicious environment has little effect? Some people have obviously been subject to turbulent winds, violent floods or blazing flame; but it seems minor. Unless you have experienced this first hand -moreso could you reflect on anyone else who had- can you really say that this is a likely worthwhile concern? "Don't burn down your house, and if tornadoes have you worried then don't move to Kansas, but what is the expectation of it happening eventually based on?" It seems that if we measured ourselves on what occurs most common and often, we would see and be pleased by the notion that it is not that bad. Moreover, could we address our own decisions and use of our time, and how that made the bulk of our days more pleasant and kind. The Man then(we could say), is one who has these expectations. He doesn't affirm that nothing bad will happen, rather he sets himself into his own time and business. In using that well, the world seems tame and lighter; moreover, can he rest on the notion that his concerns are of things that are inevitable -and it is the recognition and acceptance of that being his nature, that has him satisfied that it is not a slight to take this fortune, wherein he can resolve himself to treat it openly, and carry himself towards it well.
   <br>&emsp;People are afraid of what they don't know will happen. The mature man is not so afraid. His past time has been grasped and thus the future feels more common -for it bears more expectation of treating him the same. In addition to his strength that curbs all concern, it is his regard and care for himself that sets those unknowns in order. "However much and cruelly unscripted, can we be at least sure to the thing which it likely is." In bearing that strength towards what seems probable, the simplicity in our life can bind itself into the meaning of that end, that if it were understandably equal and as much, then it would be no problem. And if so, and this were our way, then our greatest earnings and claim would be in the way in which we were resolute, and how we demonstrated ourselves with respect this end; whereby if we believed and held it thoroughly to be true, then our aims and contribution would seep the congruence and embellishment into and from the roots of that. If our way truly has a palpable end, then our meeting of it shall be held with laughter and cheer, reminiscing how we got here by the notion that our greetings would be without regret and remission, rather treating us to a time which was well founded, generous, kind, industrious, positively flourishing and true. "In that, we say, that our claim is such, and we make for this gain."
</div>
<div id="peace">
   The world seems amiss sometimes. My place in to is not always much but clever, but our time in it is not so happily bad. The truth, as it seems, is unclear. My sight on it though is fairly founded: I just can't round its edge. The lack of solidity that follows sees me without great fortune - for the right way has dangled her more gentle aims slightly out of reach. I do look around and see where there are common opportunities, but I am generally left seeking those higher claims.
   <br>&emsp;My goal then is to simply be. Doing so well is equal in its soundness, 'for I would otherwise be struck, or waiting'. My nature is one, and overall I have continued to learn what it means. Fogged in front of me though is the grey, of which my answer seems unseen and unknown. Wherever other people sit and lie, it is not elsewhere in idleness and stress; even if these describe their place, they are not permanently settled - everyone strives for comfort and aims in some sort or fashion.
   <br>&emsp;What differs though, is what is then worth seeking? Where I have often and currently stand, is in trekking through the woodlands of uncertainty, whereby a search for more profitable knowledge is in the make. "When I was younger, this approach saw our travels as the gain of our way; as I have matured, I have rounded myself to rest and be pleased with the land that you have so far discovered." What differs though is in the far off promise, whereby my venture strives for and seeks. Seeing so much more in the distant land, my only resolve is to then be an adventurer, an explorer at least. Like any good pilgrim, we wouldn't pack for a short days ride; moreover would we not expect to get there in finality any time soon. Our course seems best then when it has some destination, even if that is simply a direction - so we can hold forth with bearing, looking for and claiming what we find. Stopping along the way though to make camp and clear out the present piece of land, seems proper with respect to the scope of our journey. Resting along the way and taking what little there is in, will not only keep your spirits high but configure the far off target in and towards the strongest reward. "If something good is not enough, then its shortcomings will reveal what would be even more substantial. Additionally, will the qualities that you actually seek become more clear and engrained, yielding a wider and purer scale for things to be measured."
   <br>&emsp;It seems that the journey of man is set on finding the best and greatest thing; and onto this part, there may only be ideals and dreams to define it. What I believe though, is that by being attentive and tuned to what you currently have as well as the nature of your present place, will a sharper and well fit use of that accurate measure develop; herein will those values we target will be more full and congenial in their make and claim. Knowing what we seek to be true, and considering that the best and most positive thing is where that aim is deemed, will give the necessary mark for things that fit this highest measure. Onto our actions and fortune, will congruence have a mold that's set - and if it is onto whatever bears the utmost and greatest, will this bear our search through excellence a success that is worthwhile and foremost as our gain.
</div>
<div id="happy">
   If we are happy, it is because our situation and use of it is tight and pleasantly met. How my time here is spent though, determines and reflects our forward experience; in other words, if we are fortunate and free, then it is the use and stake through this way that garners a joyful prominence: when this is consistent, we are flourishing. What the world is, is simply a state of circumstances, in which those who could and can use them, do so more and more to their success. "It seems acceptable that actions done merit the set of one who is made to improve upon subsequent uses. In doing so, it can only be said, that by cultural transmission, or individual experience, that one's time will be furthered in congruence and thus harmony, in whichever scenarios their made." My point is that solidity and fortune will gradually improve, at least, for you are one who is consistently asked, and thus obliged and lucky to be regular in your action - warranting developments and an advance.
   <br>&emsp;It seems that as this way is brought to fruition, you will be proper and rooted. Being so though, your time will not necessarily be the best. It may follow that one who was able to hone themselves to this line of congruence would be equally thoughtful and able to treat it well, but that is beyond the point. For all in good times or bad, the state and measure of your time reflects the reason that the effort was worthwhile at all. "Even if your time at work or within some duty or task was satisfying and enjoyable, this merely marks the fact: if you are pleased and enriched through the participation and act of living, then your life can be said to be achieved and experienced well." My note however, is that for one who is leveled in their challenge and obligations, then the time spent on top of this is not so obvious and clear. People make the mistake of thinking that their responsibilities are there to serve their time of interest, rather than their actual goal of providing stable ground for better living. Moreover, if your tasks and roles are met, and you are left wondering what to do or waiting for the next stretch of effort, then going out for drinks and fun will not produce further provisions. "It's as if we think that the week is over so we should go out and eat wings and do drugs; what about tomorrow though, or the week ahead? How much will you be enthused beyond relief from the drudgery of the work ahead, when this next week is over?"
   <br>&emsp;In short, if our responsibility is the bedrock of our ability and means to live, then our use of what this offers should primarily avoid the removal of such ability. In other words, let's say that the time that is offered from meeting these obligations with success is just if it is positive towards the nourishment and support that granted it. Therein, if the weekend comes around, the partying and fun we seek is not overtly bad, rather it is incongruent and thus unjust to the tasks ahead. As mentioned, this negativity will weigh down the work to come, draining the future of other bouts of recklessness and their satisfaction; more importantly, though, is that it is in contrast to the better kind of living itself.
   <br>&emsp;That stronger and well founded experience is not only well placed and set to continue its support and use, but is staked in purer and sounder measures. For example, the tits and tats of beer and fun are principally limited to the presence of the object; furthermore and the foremost point, is their involvement is fundamentally gluttonous and spiritually constricted. What is higher than this brief moment of indulgence and relief from the previous effort is a time and way which is solid yet round, rich yet gentle, wherein the grooves of your mind are equally and as robustly sparked as the warm and tender parts of your heart and bones. The body we seek is one that rests easy and settles in, whereby activities of greatness and cheer are emplaced and engaged substantially and frequently; throughout the hour, and over the weeks and days ought this be our reward. This briskness and love is best when it flows strongly yet simply throughout your muscles and mind: and onto that which it would dream of and lift, marks the finest objective that holds our aim above.
</div>
<div id="grace">
   Work is a struggle because there is weight: we can bear it though. That it would be smooth, or rather how much of a load there is, is in some parts determined by the reason for its press; or in other words, if the duty laid upon you was legitimate, then an unwarranted trouble it would not seem. Consequently, the willingness and reason to partake in it would open you up to treat it freely and with reverence. It is at that point that the actual demands of the role are in place. They are not bound in criticism and regret though. And seeing then what it is they are truly meant to be, gives me a firm and ready grip onto them. Foremost then is the weight acceptable. Not only as we have said does this reduce the perceived and thus responded to demands, but your alignment and composure in treating what there is amounts to more itself, wherein you generate more power and strength to carry this reasonable load -which consequently feels less heavy.
   <br>&emsp;What we have reached is a gracious point of reason. Better said, onto those points and composition born from deliberation and care are aims that are materializing as our foremost stake. Moreso, have these begun to take sway -wherein we are no longer trying to re-route ourselves away from tradition and towards purity. In our case, our youth was deemed hostile in what it asked and offered us; consequently, we took more time to deal with ourselves and solidify new values. Understandably, if one was set for those traditions, then their place in youth would have a point to build up; or, in other words, when they were at the starting line of the next stage of their life, the efforts and promise of proceeding were justified and set. In our situation, the values that were in place felt hollow and assuming. The point I am trying to illustrate is that when we discerned new values, our position to proceed towards them was different than those previous moments -which were more accepting to the (then) present lane. Initially, those new values were not fully understood as to their promise; moreover did I not even know. Where I found myself often was in a state of hopefulness and confidence, 'that my success would be similar to those in the previous lane, only in our case it would be achieved through these newly founded reasons and character'. Additionally, the time and place to make for the objective that reflected those values was not as prominent or present. "Whereas upon graduation I was expected to and encouraged to go to school and make use of all the resources and time, my place later and especially now, has less openness and room to proceed; moreso, is there less value to impart due to the expended efforts so far."
   <br>&emsp;The consequence which I wish to draw is that in rooting myself in those newer values, their objective was ill defined; my actions thus had no target to follow and very little success was made. I think the best example to describe this is as follows. You are a carpenter, and that has needs. Not only do you wish to build and ripen the skill to do so, but you also have base interests that reflect what holds the carpentry: the fact that you are a man. Now, if you build things successfully, but find yourself without much compensation, then your natural stance as the carpenter may be the only thing that bears fruition. The basic needs must be provided elsewhere, causing friction for those more genuine efforts. However, the point worth drawing is that even though you have not rooted yourself as a carpenter into the world, you are still one due to your personal creation. The idea of an objective then, is one that reflects a sounder measure of what you would do as a carpenter, and in turn have more accessibility to the world. This is because if your skillset can demonstrate itself in an impressionable way then the opportunities present will become more available as your own prominence becomes more outwardly suitable.
   <br>&emsp;This notion reflects the friction between the real world and your inner nature. In that case, its opposite would be a strict focus on what the world needs: but a consequent ignorance of who you truly are. The goal of Man seems to be a formidable expression of his truest self, wherein the response is one that reflects his fitting, and he is equally and soundly set because the impression is from that truest self. The story goes that we are raised and told how to live by those who have personally failed. Whether they have achieved outward success, or offer only regretful and resentful lessons, the message still outwardly remains. No one ever told us why or how to be ourselves: it's as if they never knew. We are animals though, of a reasonable kind and this means that our foremost state is within the use of that reason. Within that state of thinking and inquiry, the short of it lies in accurately assessing what there is, and what you ought to do. What we were told and given was a posturing account of the world; moreover, were those aims of 'success and stability' promised through the poorest form of effort. What I mean to say is that who you are must be dug out of the ground and given some roots and legs so that you can properly bloom. The resistance though, is that growing a tree takes time, and in contrast to the tree you have already risen, there will be difficulties for these new accomplishments - as people are limited in their ability to understand. But were there. And I don't know how but it seems irrelevant. What stands before me is the true field of opportunity and present gains. Onto the way forward, the treatment is equal in the parameters found in those of traditional interest: the only thing that differs is what we're striving for - and my aim there reflects the rise of me. "Thus where we will build from: and I need not their approval, for what they wished for of me, I have already claimed."
</div>
<div id="offer">
   I have done it: I am ready to make my proposal. As it goes we are natural. The reason is unclear but the steps towards it are as follows: we are limited because we have to inquire. On one front this is evidently because we can, but equally if not moreso, onto the furthest and greatest claims, the anwser we dont know: and this need then for inquiry reflects our limited composition. Ontologically this seems sound. We are addressing this case through cognitive action, and cementing the findings as the root of our make. The action though suggests we have a nature: which fortells that we have a stake. This is so because to ones who are natured, it is reasonable to suggest that per their kind, they are inclined to be a certain way. "If there are many kinds of nature, then the action that suitably follows will be regarded as our personal tendency. Consequently, will the medium in which we are placed bear things which are congenigal to those inclings; the congruence by us towards those things which naturally fit our way, is the means to a truly rich and abundant experience: of which is a natures foremost claim."
</div>
<div id="wherefore">
   I'm ready to make a real proposition. It follows like this. I have many things and have seen many more; they are not mine though. In treating my experience of people, interests and care with clear attention, I can see that we are separate. What I propose, however, justly follows. What I would say is that what I have is rooted in what I've defined. There is much as I said that I have seen, but it is mere minnows swimming in the pond. Regarding what I have actually thought upon and assimilated within me, this creation is truly what we'll say is mine. "And I stand on it nicely, fittingly and tall."
   <br>&emsp;The amount in this case though, seems hollow. It is not from a lack of opportunity to incorporate; on that there is a wide selection of things viable and interesting. What it is, is within the limits of what the west has referred to as the Logos. Effectively, the sounder measure where the aim of this approach is placed is prior and thus a mere precedent to our actual use of the answer found. Or in other words, from our inspection of the world, be it accurate or not, acting upon the results forewards us into what we are meant to be.
   <br>&emsp;I believe the problem is two fold. On one hand you have the sense that your impression is incomplete, and your action is thus without a proper case to follow. Following this sentiment though, we can see that a reverence for purer insight wagers us against the proceeds that need to follow. Where we limit ourselves in this regard is in remedying the concern for certainty, but searching for meaning instead. Better said, do we wonder what our findings are meant for us to entail; or in other words, what is the measure that reflects the proper use of knowledge. Interestingly, it appears that our theological tendencies were bent towards this concern whereas our more scrupulous past saw more attention paid onto better defining those things in which our values meet.
   <br>&emsp;Briefly, I think that clarifying that notion of figures and resolve would go a long way toward furthering our proposal. To the former, I mean our impression of what a thing is; the latter reflects the scale that determines what these things mean, or in regards to them what we should do. My suspicion is that the exact need for either is the effect of each being too emphasized, while the other is given too little regard. Plainly speaking, it seems that our means for investigation and our inquiry into our personal values balance eachother out in being significant in our own circumstances. "The problem with religion and philosophy is that they seek to reach a point of complete understanding; both in terms of how things are and how we should be." Principally, I find this wrong through our ontology of inquiry and its limits proposed. Moreover, does the real reflection of who we are bring a forefront line wherein a relevant and effective guide can offer the answers we seek to gain.
   <br>&emsp;It is in the mere fact that our fundamental interests are rooted in our own desire. Questioning whether our aim is just is worthwhile: that there is one though and what this means, seems to clarify and proclaim where it is our effort should be. Moreover, does the presence of any kind of desire, suggest that there is an accomplishment worth achieving; moreover could we say that there is one that is appropriate -as much as we have something uniquely congenial." This latter point reflects my forward sentiment. At heart, this example illustrates a piece of our humanity. That we are ones seems definite; of what kind and in what mannered way, this is the question. What I would propose is that we solidify ourselves under the notion of the things we are. Regardless of the kind and manner, can our ability to adjust and inquire bring us to a point in which the optimal way to be is discovered. What my point rests on though is this presumption, that of men and reason, we are. Of which type or variety, the particular kind will be considered good if it is positive.Of which and what kind I do not know. My principle confession merely rests that there is one to be had -because we are so. Our industry and strength is simply best if it is applied to uncovering what that is. My suggestions are strictly onto what that resolve should be if our aim is one that offers an experience of prosperous ability and joy. My imperative though, and of which my proposal's objective is set to request, is that we base our actions and interest on the principle that there is an experience to be sought for at all. "And to that, there is puzzlingly set the mystery of personal definement, and the dynamics cultivating what it hopes to fair.
   <br>&emsp;Personally, I am satisfied with this quest due to the implication of what this inquiry means to me. Ontologically, it suggests I exist. Because it is deliberate, it suggests that we have a nature, for we are actionable, and possessing at least some portion of it which is of a prominent kind. That our scope would have some weight regarding an aim, then seems well founded and true. Foremost from the fact that our experience -in deliberate inquiry- suggests a result which is better than some; moreover that this suitable kind of being would be more elaborate and substantial due to the presence of prominence within our expression (I suspect). That this grandest and purest experience is our aim, is marked by the inspection of our own ability to inquire; the resolve and aim to act accordingly seems consequently worthwhile and legitimate. To my end in rest, from the road of joy until then, I say forwardly that this is enough for me, and consequently proclaim that we set our minds around this, and affirm tremendously to ourselves that it is where we intend to go: and is thus our stake and aim, the seems and lining of which I propose we sow.
</div>
<div id="aproposal">
   It is hard to make proposals. “What about this my lord?” they howl; I reply “I am not your king.” They shout back “then why are you telling us what to do!” I merely say “I am only asking you to agree.” They respond then with “and what if we do?” Therein I stand firm and forth, venerating the proper course of conduct wherein I say “ladies and gentlemen, I am Ryan. I am not your king nor your ruler: I simply have a proposal to make. What it is based on is lengthy and substantial; what it personally amounts to though is short and sparse: for I fear too much to say a lot when only a little of it is known.” I stammered, but kept on. “I have arrived at something I am confident in though, and am thus assured in making it my claim. It is an offer, of which you can repeal and or spite. I do believe it has merits however, and to each of you I recommend that you heed its sentiment and consider to you, whether it is or is not true. If it seems so, then you may assent; if it does not, then you can descend from here, and in addition oppose.” One man who stood took the crowd to new lengths of which they had never known. He said, “what is it you mean to say, be quick about it!” I stood even more firm, beginning to settle as I was already clear on where I needed to go. In that spot, I made my claim.”I propose that we live our greatest way. That is, we should live appropriately with respect to our kind, so that our experience is rich in its gain. That this is good and true is what I mean to propose: I am merely resting on the fact that you are all rooted in a kind of which we are made the same. What I see then is that what you see as promising, of which you might refer to as positive and or profitable, would mark your regard in assent and resolve -as would be the case for that appropriate action and aim for which your nature is made.” The crowd shuffled, unassured yet equally unassuming. I furthered, “that this is the way I do not know: for I cannot. This is principally the case as my deepest inspection has revealed to me. What this suggests and henceforth where my attention goes, is how this limit reflects the nature in me, and thus where I am best to go. You see friends, having a nature or kind means that there will be particular interests and needs which optimally correspond. What is then congenial to us, will reward our state of congruence and solidity.” I cleared my breath for the following would be my greatest set, “and it is that joy, that flourishing, prosperously and in abundance that we would gain, that I wish for us to strive for and meet. It will be easy I promise: we are merely lining ourselves to the world as to reflect our proper make. All this requires is the inspection of what that is that we truly are; if we can know the world in an equally detailed manner, then fitting the two will be a breeze. Working through this way together is in short what I propose.”
   <br>&emsp;The crowd seemed to be coming in and out of attention. The facts were not dismissable, but the reflection within our suggestion bore them little stake: eventually though, I gave more particular application. “Simply put my friends, I am tired. Too long has it been since my kindred effort and ways had a friend, and the time is right and now for the aim of freedom and industry to win. This is the mold for the spot that marks and houses the objective we seek: what I wish for and where I am ordained to propose, that these interests be embellished through community and conviction. I am no longer going to go towards the greens we seek on my own, for as I’d strictly claim, the pasture here is for all. What I am is simply a man, not your ruler and king. It is from my own inquiry that I have been treated: what I wish is for us to act the same, and share a bigger bounty. Someone shouted from the crowd, with others by their side, “why should we listen to you, your barely past a boy!” I was not struck or shaken. “I don’t give you these thoughts as some form of judgment or demand; I simply wish to offer you insight into what I see; and if you, being so old and mature seemingly, could offer the time and care to listen, then do so willingly; as I would be most pleased as to share my interest in making this opportunity a collaborative one. I cannot say whether we will succeed or fail; but through my own years of tremendous thought and care can I say to you forwardly and true, that there is green and warmer seas near and on the horizon. That is where I wish to go: but I believe that you will be suited for it to.
   <br>&emsp;As it were, they were slipping; so I stood and spoke directly and forth. “What I propose is that we hold this aim. In tending to the land together, will earn us all the greatest claim. The only power that I would wish to have is in offering you the opportunity to reach these profits: for it is within your generous actions and industrious ways that the rewards from care and contribution will be met -and onto those claims, I mean to widen the road. If this place is one in which we’d truly prosper, then it will be for one and all. If we choose to be alone, then we will be at most happy in dark -as I have been. I want to be out in the world with all its riches and abundance, and effortlessly offer my own time and treatment. Does the prosperous joy and gain of that not reflect what all of us seek: are we not of a kind which can work towards and make this happen? I want more of this true abundance in my experience: but I have only been so alone and inside. With a friend or a group, for humanity, will our collaboration and effort earn us this greatest gain -and all the wins from the achievement that follows. What I simply propose is that we stake this in deep as our objective, and arrange ourselves with a resolve to work towards and reach this way. The steps towards it seem only common and natural as our previous ventures have revealed: we split the atom to end the war, and have made the world that’s followed more leveled and free. Let’s use it openly, we can. The way in which is only limited by our own proposal, that doing so is the worthwhile claim. By selecting ourselves to be reverent and set towards this stake can our resolve bring us to the target we seek.” “Is that it,” they said, howling with brutish despair. A conclusion was all I could make. “Where I stand is on these sides of life that feel most promising: my command though onto this end, if I could only in short say, is that we furnish ourselves and sharpen our desires, to mold in and make it an aim. For in that, I am proposing a way, in which together, we could all achieve this gain.” To those who listened, they at least headed; some went forth, and others around, but at least their respective paths were somewhat profitable -by virtue of their deliberation. Those who knew so well otherwise, well they ran away and fought eachother; for what they sought had nothing by meatless bone -which made competition only more likely, as no one could win.
   <br>&emsp;And I alone, sat on my throne, of our own, amongst the world and men. Only, as a man though, were they all friends to me, as I to myself. “And in that, was I set and present to a lasting aim -of which the collaboration would seemingly further, and thus what I proposed.”
</div>
<div id="makinguse">
   Very simply, my mind has left itself from being contrast to an objective. Prior, I felt very firmly that I would be treated and rewarded for who I am; the work I would do did seem great, but the emphasis was motivated by the need and assertion that I would be granted a profited response. What seems obvious now, is that good things will happen because they were aimed at. The repercussions will grant the relevant rewards, but the goods must be made. My resolve then is to remove ambition and develop an aim. More to the point, would I say that my objective fields and houses our efforts, as to employ and demand we participate in an oriented and founded way; here, we can then offer ourselves and contribute, whereby the means to do so are furthered through the effort and reached upon our aim of flourishing generosity and joy.
   <br>&emsp;I see so much that has gone by wherein I was waiting, expecting, striking my pose with victory seemingly on the horizon. The bedrock though was less of what would warrant me to be champion." Releasing myself from the demands of discipline and focus, I instead leapt into the planes and eye of glory and infamy." I've lost friends, spoilt roommates, squandered time and energy that was previously set for the right kind of care. Moreover, have I yet solidified myself into something which is actually true to me. "It's as if all these years have gone by, and I am only just now realizing that there is someone to be."
   <br>&emsp;My remission is a struggle, for the effects of reaching this point aside from truth and her congruency sees me thin in my objective and cold onto what I freely declare. It seems that this realization is minutely obvious, as we try harder to be separate from our previous impotence, we still turn back towards the glory and fame - merely from higher above. Being here with status though, morally, still sees me shot with poor assurance; moreover, am I reticent to take on or be alive in the hopes and pursuit of our human riches. A girlfriend, quicker earnings, means to greatness, or simply the breath and fairs of a friendship, equally slip my time. As I said, we are in the bunker, selling ourselves short of what would actually be a sound exchange.
   <br>&emsp;But our energy and care has not always been here though, and moreover is our place now not so easily amended. "As I say, happiness is the beginning, whereby the ground is open and free for you to work for and contribute into what you seek the most." The problem though is that in our current state, this reassembly was made whereby our circumstances barred youthful and naive optimism. We have to be sound and sharp onto what we actually need, for no one else is providing. Moreso, is this not a place to find out what it is we really seek: for that is what the previous time was for. Whether we are in good times or bad, our aim is now rooted in the objective that sprouts it, regularly and through. What our goal is then, is to nourish and support the means of progress and development in this case. "It is our end though, and all but we are gone."

<div id="adolescence">
   I was born to be made, yet my interests were lined with tradition and unclear aims. As a youth I rebelled, reaching a point of adolescence later on -where my reverence and respect demanded I comply. I did so for some time without sparse willingness, ending up near the ground below. Better said, I resisted and denied the values that seemed so necessary, and I tried to find something that suited me, with positivity, and exponentially more. Moreover, in those more base and common states, did I see no need for ambition to rid me of their stiffness; instead, I leaned inwards and solidified my own heart and bone. In doing so, the predicament became more leveled and manageable, 'whereby things we alright as they were, because I was now better'.
   <br>&emsp;The years that followed this however, are best described as one who still sees those further claims outside their current position. The reason being that in that personal solid state, my interests and values changed. Rooted in this inward stability and strength, the aims I had were much more involved with my own creative and studious efforts. Moreso, did my circumstantial needs wain as what I sought was pure effort -which required nothing more than me to gain. Our scenario still asked me to provide for it though and this upset me. Those values and aims which were more industrious and personal bore the true and worthwhile target: I did not know why I should or otherwise had to provide. Consequently, I took advantage of times when nothing but those efforts were supported. I would live at home, or be more costly in my spending -because I had no future monetary intentions. The rot under the tree though, is that I always sought to remove the need for that situational stability. Even if I was living at home, the promise of future roles and tasks held me back from making better use of that freer time. " Its as if I knew I would eventually return to those rugged grounds."
   <br>&emsp;This bore two things consequently. Within our green estate -which I spent reoccurring years and time- my efforts were never set or consistent. If I ultimately spent 8 months there, I never did so under that notion; even if I knew I would be there for a long time, my foresight was still shadowed by expectations; my purer efforts were thus dealt with more immediately -and this prevented any lasting stretch of work, as it felt like it needed to be done now. "And nothing great, like Rome, can be built in a day." On top of that(as our second point) sits the fact that this hesitance developed a desire for those purer aims to be provisional to themselves. In other words, my true and rooted claim was the joy and feeling from writing; unable to do so consistently because I saw the responsibilities ahead, I sought that the writing would make me a success -all so I could write! This sentiment put my interests up on a pedestal, whereby their value became rounded in their potential; moreso did I see myself as more impressive for having such ambitions from these great works. The repercussions of this were a long developed anticipation of being treated fortunately and with praise, because of who I was personally, and from the works that followed. In bringing it out, the early stages of it could not support its own effort, so our dreams turned towards how and when that could be. In those goods we did not grow, and neither it as our prospect nor our most sought effort, developed any way far and further -by which there was no innate fortuned gain.

   Similar to our stake in Ontology, it would be wise to rest on and proceed from the soundest principle. Foremost it would seem is to remove and relish the fact that we have: our vanity. As previously stated, we've come from tradition and youthful grounds, whereby our aims and interests were embellished through the motivation of achievements valued during the times before; moreover, are the means to those not as strictly accessible towards are newly developed claim for success. Considering the partial difficulties of moving forward from this place, I recommend we remove the false interests and expectations of that time before. Seeing as we are set to something further and large, our aim of it must be clear as can be: and those anticipations and regard for ones self that sprouted during our juvenile stage, have neither a claim in our current objective nor any means to support it. Additionally, as a remedy and better means to what we can find, are things that better fit the place of our current ambition. In other words, we should remove the rust and brevity of our previous days, and fill them up with equal consideration for these newly founded objectives. In short, we shall and have removed our vain demands and given our new goals more chances of success -appropriate to them that is. "As if our goods and character are to be rewarded and praised for what they are, rather than the treatment through the value that they provide."
</div>
<div id="constance">
   It is clear that work is required. It pumps you up and keeps you limber and accepting of fuel, which supports your industry and make. These efforts require recovery though. If the means to generosity and concentration are found in fitness and physical stature, maintance of that engine is paramount - equal to the worth of the aims it provides. I've noticed however, that being in that industrious state, keeps me active and thus prevents rest from happening. It does sort me out though and generally contributes little in the wake of fatigue, but it seems to prevent decompression and re-establishment of those inner cogs.
   <br>&emsp;Being active is not contrary to our success; it is what provision is for. My experience in being imperfect has shown me though, that poor choices render the dullness in the consequent rest, to be similarly poor. When I train and recover, it is best when it fits the line of being restorative. Otherwise, if I am idol and stiff, I tend to be the same. Our active stake can be helpful here, tending our meantime to be more hospitable and congruent to easier movements and simple rest.
   <br>&emsp;It seems as though our aim is a plea where I seek and look to return. The actions that bring about this have my intentions in being regular to that; they're behind us though. Our imperfection brings us to seek a better past, where decisions and lack had not yet been made. Moving forward then sees only knowledge of how and what was lost, defining it in the way you proceed so as not to make it again. My answer to each question when it comes to resolves, is by addressing the means by which that past was garnered. Assuredly it was done by precedent decisions. Had those actions not been tampered with and your bearings changed, you would be equal if not more, and remain thus satisfied.
   <br>&emsp;We must trust our actions to void us of harm and earn a preferable way; as far as we stray we'll discover that which is incongruent; equally, what is pleasurable and sought will reinforce similar actions, bearing us the knowledge of the truth of how we bring that way. Our responsibility and decisions then should stem from the ease of continuation, progress towards things that seem evident to contribute more, and, adjusting away from those things which cause such stray, bearing us back towards the good in our core.
</div>
<div id="character">
   As a preface, I will say this promptly: if you are a sound person, it is because your character and ground is rooted in truth and strong principles. The man though, is revealed and abundant through their demonstration of these principles, wherein they apply them in and towards particular things. A common but good example is fitness. If your aim is centered on vanity, or relief from shame, then your actions will follow with these as the targets. If however your interest is the means to a sounder and fuller use of your time, then that robustness that you seek will serve as an equal target. Now, whether or not either of these is more founded and true, requires a great deal of clarity. Simply though, we could foreshadow that the reason we’d employ as to find what bore more truth, would surely treat us to a way of being which was rooted in regularity and substance. Therein, the man is one who does the thing which yields a more amendable and consistent profit, and thus he is more set and awarded towards the relevant means through demonstration. If that offer on his part is as such, then we can say that his orientation is sound. In other words, the proper way to be, or rather the richer values to have, are those which bear the most substantial and consistent gain.
   <br>&emsp;The real question though, is what things and activities bring out these interests? If robustness for example is the sounder aim, then the particular things which yield robustness are of equal claim -as the things which are congenial to our interest. Simply, if we thought about those values, and furthered our insight into the routes in which we could bring them out, then it ought to be as simple to inspect particular actions and measure their own natures and profit, then simply align those which fit the groove of our principles and aims. If we see then, that robustness is reached through smooth and plump training, as well as being done so consistently -as to be regular in reaching the target- then we might find that pushups are more wholesome and thus worthwhile (by their light yet sturdy nature) whereas benchpress, machines or closed chain weights, are more stiff and brittle, and thus offer less when it comes to ‘the open and tender efforts that robustness seeks’. Moreover then, could we say(in this case), that if pushups were congruent in the kind of action our interest needs, then the equal regularity required to maintain and keep those rewards, similarly makes that proper activity acceptable to be done regularly. The mark here of a man is that he was deliberate and well founded in his aim, sharp in his assessment of what was congenial, and prolific and true in his resolve to bring out the pairing. “Those are his roots.” The consequence of doing this across the board of the many aspects relevant to our lives, is a common place in which these things exist within the man, properly and true.
   <br>&emsp;A point worth drawing though, is in regard to the assessments. If our values are well placed and strong, then our grooves will be set for the best things. The things that fit well however, must be explored and explained themselves so that the auditions (so to speak) are made with accuracy. In other words, if our values are oriented in any given way, then their demands should be sharply met with proper and sound definitions of the viable suiters. “So we can find those who will treat our interests truly the best.” Thinking on these, is rooted in a request. Here, you are pleaing and inviting all those who are applicable and able to contribute. The greatest thing in the world is in the abundance of this congruence, whereby the widest set of values are tightly met and expressed. The wider our search then, to what is amiable and set to play the roles and meet our demanded parts, will allow for a more effective and substantial cast. Our goal then as a man -who is trying to bring himself foremost- is to conduct the most interviews, inquires, illustrations, assessments, remedies and smoothing of judgment, the removal of presumptions and assumptions, and the conduction of surveys, reflections, auditions, castings and or selections. From that, we will have seen and heard the world, and thus be further able to sensibly and steadily contribute the best ingredients into our recipe. “Wherein we can constantly bake the biggest, ripest, sharpest, freshest, greatest, beneficial and wonderful array and assortments of cakes, cookies and cream.” Here, we will be tasting the fullest and worthwhile treats.

<div id="direction">
   It feels here, that there is some poorly defined notion of what health needs. Your resolve to orient yourself around the demands -as to reach health - is commendable, but lacking something. Point in case, we can agree that your actions will have the final regard. If so, then our ends will vary based on the actions we place. Unless there is simply a measure of health -or any short number of things- then it may not be worth it to care. My feeling though is that even in the particular case of health, that the additional notion of longevity, feelings of robustness and strength etc., add considerable complexity and roundedness to your aim. "It is not that health should not be sought; moreover am I not saying that it should not simply be enough for you: but did you decide on it? Was it thought about with clarity and non-assumptions, then affirmed as a deliberate aim, or were you simply running away from misfeelings and grievance back onto what you thought you already knew."
   <br>&emsp;In other words, if we wish to feel robust regularly and well, then the actions that bring this out must be aimed at and adhered. Case in point though, only as much as we demonstrate these means to our interest, will our interest be brought out. Therein, will a lack of clarity to our aim, mean little consistency to what would actually offer us what we truly seek; moreso, will we be irregular in any demonstration at all. That irregularity rests simply on the case that despite even the shortest and base ambition, a sharp and clear aim for it will see a persistent target. If that aim -or more complex ones- lose their place as our interest, then our motivation and means for activity will flounder - and we will be left with none.
   <br>&emsp;My case and guidance then settles on the point of deliberation. What this amounts to, is merely being forward and concise about what you really seek, wherein the target and claim are both accurately pictured, and thus more prominently set for our active regard. So long as the consideration is active itself, can we say that we had a worthwhile and integrated target, for we thought of one, developed its intricacies, and choose it for ourselves. Furthermore, if the assignment for these gains is made for our effort to seek, then the draw will not only be placed onto something encouraging and swell, but wholeheartedly placed too -as we have an aim at all.
</div>
<div id="thetimes">
   I have wondered for some time why the things we think to be true are so with reason, or merit, and whether or not the workings beneath our assumptions and proposals are merely unaccounted for. More specifically, I wonder why it is for example, that being objective and elaborate within our intentions is proper when it comes to being ourselves. It does seem correct that if you are industrious, then your aim and figure of being so is best when it is formed thoroughly and with care. My question though is what does that entail in turns of our own action? In other words, "why does laying a stake that is congenial to us, offer a response that we will oblige? Why is it that simply being thoughtful and deliberate will produce a binding between intention and aims?" I think a reasonable point is that if our nature is a certain way, then our being so is likely common; in the same way that an energetic child bounces all around regardless of the scenario, our own benefit might be acquired in the same way as theirs. In that case, they would be better off if their energy was focused on things more productive and useful; in our own case, our industry would be improved if its application was onto something that A) merited and drew it prominently, and B) that the figure and form of this mold was one that allowed for a consistent amount of substantial offering. In other words, if the post which we'd place is aimed at us being more generous and contributive -in whichever natural regard- then it ought to be one that is more than a momentary thing. Even if the quality of a scenario or objective is ripe in its promise, the regularity in which we could participate marks the purer kind of success. When it comes to our energetic kid then, if we gave them something to do with the aim of honing their focus, but it was limited in both the amount they could actually offer, and moreso that its place as an objective was short in its lasting, then this would not solidify(for them), any form of lasting success. "Is that not what each of us desires, and hopes to accept -that our effort was thus proper, with a reward that was consequently one we were happy to acquire?"
   <br>&emsp;One of the things I believe is happening is that through the strength in our discoures, our ability to be actionable and placed where it is set, is more abundant and effective. The repercussion of this though is when you reach a point where you have expanded upon and furthered your goal and objective, you find yourself unsure of what is coming next. The cause of this seems to be remission from outside material, wherein a fumbling of your current expression leads to the fear that it will not improve: for the stresses from the world prod you to surpass them. This is a fairly rudimentary sentiment, as our real ability is baked in the constance of our achievements; here, the progress we make overlaps with previous efforts 'and we never find ourselves having finished, but withing nothing left that we wish to or are able to do'.
   <br>&emsp;As with most things, the center is hard to find. The initial point seems to always flank us from the rear, but infront I think there's good inline. At this place beyond, sits the world of potential. The unease and laxity I feel is in not knowing where we'll go, as well as a stiffness in proceeding because of that fear of idleness. What I actually suggest is a practice that is more malleable and set for you to comfortably proceed. At heart, much work has been done. Moreso, have these efforts been well founded and placed, as their demonstration was that of previous set intentions. What our goal now should be, is a layering of new objectives, wherein we properly set ourselves to add to those previous developments. Within this process is the reflection of what you have achieved so far, but this is merely sifting through and firming the present gains: the current objective is in seeing where they will be furthered towards, and in that is where we'll make for and aim.

<div id="life">
   Our circumstances can be engendered with rationality, as to make them more hospitable and better placed amongst the things which we actually seek. If the ground is more approved and leveled then the ability to do better things will be more clear and prominent - thus we are more open to that which we can imagine ourselves doing. From this, the aim can be our treat, and our circumstances can be valued for their means to these gains. Moreover, can we engage with those circumstances in a way in which they are in the realm of satisfaction, equaled by the claims in which they offer; from that, we are not only willing to oblige the tasks, but see them as acceptable points of contribution themselves.
   <br>&emsp;On our scenario and the many aspects that make its kind, are several things that make the mold: the state of yourself, and moreso your family and friends; your financial situation from investment and fortune, and equally, your place within basic income -and the role that follows. Additionally, are your prospects and ambition, wherein that scenario draws you out to improve the position, and thus the applicable motives that you seek. Lastly, and in similar heart to the most former(of yourself), is your training and readiness, or in other words, the state of your ground, in body and mind, words and nourishment; in contrast to that former, it has more weight on your feelings of contentment, or lack there off; this position, or aspect, is moreso in regards to your habits and practices -similar to a basic income, only from yourself and within.
   <br>&emsp;There are many of those scenarios within my life which worth discussing with respect to those parameters. When I was a child, in elementary school no less, compared to my intermediate years -before I had moved and family tension had risen. My secondary years from beginning to end, focusing foremost on the years later on -when drama and changes had also risen. The time that followed had little besides me, and the developments there were equal as such; however, these moments progressed into an honest exposure and expression from me into the common world, whereby I gained a great deal of maturity and confidence, although my ambitions and desires did not prevail -on which is worth reflecting on. Not lastly but most recently completed, are the more recent years and their root in responsibly developing; compared to our current state of being deliberate and generous, that previous stretch saw me shedding the past notions of necessary success, and personal aims based on my own prowess, and the feeling that I would be treated with a courteous response. From that time on, I had shed any ambition of being rewarded simply for who I am; now, as I am just that, I have learned why I should apply myself, for generosity and thus joy's sake. In that, I have seen the little that is required for me to be and flourish as myself - onto which I now venture and explore.
   <br>&emsp;All of these moments reflect periods of my life in which dramatic things were happening across the board. As I grew up and my character and knowledge was roughly put to the test, the nature of the world became more familiar, and I grew a continued insight into my lackings, and interest from being inside of it. Still to this day, do I not know, despite being well rested and rooted ahead. This current place of mine sees equal positions of uncertainty, as I make for my needs and satisfaction, amidst the similar experience of remission from duty, and gain of comfort as to ease my way. "I don't fear what is ahead, but I do repent at the fact that even though we have noteworthy and solid ambition, our place still isn't stilled and relishable, that we have no such notion."
   <br>&emsp;I think that in being myself, I see the means to do so even more and more. The developments and commission here though are very progressive, and outside the desires of those who merely wish to be more set; our place is in contrast to all who seek separation, and something exciting or new. I am not bogged down by much, and our contributions rise higher than the simple duties tasked onto me; moreso, do those duties provide the simple means to make such efforts, whereby I treat and offer my time wholeheartedly and with abundance - in and for myself. "It just seems like there's much more to go, and what this requires of me still remains a pressing burden."

<div id="settledin">
   Plutarch remarks the fact that farmers seek shoots of corn which have begun to tip over, signifying that they are beginning to ripen and firm. He uses this notion to demonstrate the difference between students early on in their goal of philosophy, in that their ears and minds spring up as if drawn to the light from a dark abyss below; what he compares them to, are those of a more experienced and profitable kind, who have taken the light(so to speak) and dressed themselves in its brightness, wherein they themselves shine -as opposed to those who are eagerly drawn and perplexed. In other words, the firm and ready nature of a soul which has matured and solidified, is similar to the corn head that dips down under its own weight, whereas a light and air filled one sits thinly up.
   <br>&emsp;Regarding a scenario in which I find myself, is a contention I find with one of my neighbors, whereby their head is similarly light and sprung up, but lacking any of that weight or substance. For the sake of example, I would illustrate the difference between him and I, whereby the height of each of us reflects our stature and stability. Additionally though, I would add the trunk of the stock, wherein the point in which it crowns up or tips over, does so from the peaks of a varying height. For detail’s sake, I would say that my stalk is equal if not higher than my compatriot. The issue arises though, in that my crop is much firmer and sound, wherein my essence nestles itself below the tip of my foundedness. I like this and enjoy it. It reflects the fact that we have come and reached far, but are able to let it sink in, and actually give me the merriment and cheer I sought to gain. Contrasting this to my neighbor, his stalk is not so high; it is sound, and has some strength in its own right, but is explicitly the same(in its peak), if not lower. The disparity arrives when I consider that my crop -however dipped from its profit- still remains at the height of his own thinned peak. Consequently, I feel sometimes that even though I am more reticent and composed, that my power and embellishment still stretches further than his towering expression -or better said his perkiest one. In other words, at his strict and firm best, my solidified and rooted nature is still more prominent. “In other words, as I stand gently within myself, so too do we still meet eye to eye, in which he stands his tallest.”
   <br>&emsp;The contention arises in that my humblest and purest thoughts and claims have more prowess than his smug attitude. “He says very little, and cares little for inquiries -or to mine, a response.” He is not mean, but full of air, whereby an issue or judgment made on my part, is treated as though an obvious answer was present, of which he knew. “Its as if he believes he is already made, but does not act accordingly -for why would one so well off be so hidden yet smug?” My feeling is he is more satisfied with himself, as opposed to having any fidelity in what he actually does. “In that would there be actual conversation.” The reason is in his fortune and sophistry, rather than a cheered reverence, or integrity to and towards aims based through rationality. This is all judgment outside my care to refute -for I mean not to penalize or be critical, as his nature is not my business. My simple regard for the matter rests merely on the fact that we struggle with getting along. Nothing is hostile between us, and despite any stillness in our relationship, a friendly acceptance of the other is present. I wish there was more though, but he seeks so little. I, who seeks and resolve to much, can find more peace and happiness in assessing stations more accurately. I don’t say or sound too much in times which were better set to be brief and little; or, if I have something personal to share, or some interest or experience that I could relate to him about and ask, then I do so when it is appropriate and fair -whereby a heartier discussion would be more relevant and acceptable. “I guess it is just hard to sink in and actually incorporate the richness of your rational gain, yet still be yourself amongst those who sit high and hollow.” Because the former is most preferable, as well as being right in it’s favor, then against that friction and corresponding isolation, will I affirm the better. “For I can then keep to that.”

<div id="culture">
   That is not what I think any longer. Instead, I believe our roots have changed to what they would have been before the uprising of our current culture: and onto that marks the fact that we are set for a better claim. What this means is that our interests and worries are not made from the front of our present line. In that case, civilization has been developing and our values within it have advanced correspondingly. I see much that has resulted poorly, in that we are no longer deliberate, but moreso is the simple fact that what we wish for and hope to avoid is wrong. We have not personally changed, and the medium that dictates the things offering has explicitly remained. What I intend is to accomplish a bevy of industrious and philosophical results through the means of deliberation, reverence and care. No more will I rest outside and dangle my hopes that something good will happen from me being so. It is in that composure of greatness, that my active embrace and expression of it is demanded and helmed by me. To those though who are already present, can I say that my aim is not to directly provide, but be myself. Therein, my place as a member amongst people shines a light from me being a great one of the kind: in that, will those of the group be treated from my own gains.
   <br>&emsp;It is simply the case that those who do poorly in this world A) do so at their own fallibility, and B) make little use of the success they have. In that, even those at the top of the rubble still fall down. This is because there is no thoughtfulness or care onto what we seek and require, as well as how we hold ourselves through and upon the results. The lock to the door then is out of order, 'and we are bent towards a poor experience regardless of our wellness within our values'. In other words, even if we do well, our profits will swell because we poorly use them. Forewardly then would I say that onto all results that they require some aspect of reason and virtue.
   <br>&emsp;However, what this suggests is that if all of our results our only made proper within the presence of those qualities, then the effect of those attributes being part of our own composure has its own primary effects. Put another way, the necessity of reason is onto the use of our gains -of all kinds that is. Furthermore, would we say that the strength and constant abundance of reason would allow the good we get to persist: in that case, there is a forever need for reason so long as we wish to be more genuinely well. The effect rooted in the nature of this claim is that the presence of reason will also determine the results -alongside helping us make use of them. "It is as if our profits were reasonably set and equally gained. Wherein the former reflects the way and stake of our obtainment, and the latter reflects the incorporation and settlement from achievement -of which the process is advanced continually."
   <br>&emsp;In short, the need for a result to be truly good is that it is made an actual accomplishment: therein, would winning the lottery and wasting all the money not earn you that much, whereas being given a little that you make a great use of reflect a sound reward. It is reason which achieves the latter. The stock within reason then -for the sake of accomplishment- consequently alters our gaze. If this is truly so, then our need to case our gains within the reason also demands (as I suppose, and mean to propose) that the marker that is set also be forged from a similar kind of care. In other words, the thoughtfulness and attention required to proceed from a point of accomplishment, suggests that that point be reached from an equal kind of gaze; moreover, does this bear strength in that our wish to accomplish more be rooted from the purity of our achievements thus far: and onto those gains which were made genuine through reason, would the advance from there not include the present disposition? Or in more simple terms, if reason is the demand for us to truly win, then is it not comparably bound for us to set the objective, as well as plan the attack? "Should we not live within reason if our results are only made sound within its use? I would say then that better aims could be met and genuinely accomplished using a similar sentiment of care. And with respect to our culture then, will these kinds of effort and resolve contrast its own ill deliberate and assuming process"

<div id="ofentirety">
   I could be better off to write this, but the notion is too ripe to wait. Or, rather, it is so pure and true what I wish to suggest, that it would retain merit and strength within my drunken treatment. What that sentiment reflects is the core theory of humanity thus far -at least that which has till this point been proposed. In ancient Greece, the renowned philosopher Plato -who is the hallmark, though to my knowledge less so than Aristotle- put forth the Allegory of the Cave. Within this depiction, he illustrated a scene wherein a light cast a shadow from behind those who would see it, whereby the impression was taken from the images flickering on the wall infront. What his point was is not strictly the place I mean to attend. For the sake of argument, we can summarize it as Man not knowing what true reality is -in some way respecting the later developed idealism of the 18th century. This may be true and, consequently, has prolonged itself as the figure that best reflects our intellect (and its limits). I have my own proposal though: and it is from my place outside of the cave.
   <br>&emsp;The stretch between these two depictions is not my concern to strictly define, at least in this situation. What I would venture to put forth is the nature of the lands outside of this cavern of ignorance. In this area, the air is open and we are truly free. The weight of it though does shoulder you with an overwhelming sense of both the frailness of things and our limits in being present. That last point perhaps provides the difference, in that those who are ignorant have no sense that they are, whereas those who are out in the open at least realize that their impressions are muddied. What I wish to say though more prominently is about our time and being in this open space. Here, we are imbued with the utmost expressions of the world and all of entirety. “It is the fact that the cave, being a metaphor so to speak, manifests itself in reality within the measure of your openness and ability to acquire the unbridled experience that reflects the nature of reality. In other words, if you are seeing it all, then you are not in the cave.”
   <br>&emsp;That being said, our time in this vast expanse can be paralyzing. Initially, at least, it can be unsettling to know how big things are and, relatively speaking, how little we are in comparison. Moreso, does the cause and reason for these things operating as they do, and moreso to our purpose and need to treat them burden us with indecisiveness and the fear that follows. There is a resolve though, and I wish to and mean to profess it. My feeling however is that our place in this very moment may not be sharp enough or able to illustrate and assess the proper thinking that reflects the weight of this situation. Moreso, would the principle which I stand on suggest that our advocacy be based purely on strength; and, equally then, do I and would I suppose that this means that our claim sits outside of the certainty that those in shock fearfully request. “It may simply be the case that unless I can elaborate onto the figure of this sentiment in the roundest way, and then further examine and assess the particular things relevant to us and how they should be treated (from this figure of values), may beckon me to be weary onto our offerings, as well as our own expectations of what this foremost place of thinking provides -considering our shrillness to work boldly yet tenderly within our limits.”
   <br>&emsp;What this is remarks the fact, again, that we are limited. What it entails though is that we are at best going to look up at the stars, and that this should suffice within the claims of the stair. It is in that impression wherein we are drawn out to feel and see, that we hold ourselves higher than we would if the floor had our gaze. In that upward turn we rise, building ourselves up through our industrious inspection. “That’s what being an Architect means. Whereas a civil engineer aims at the clearest and straightest cut for his development, the man of reverence and care strikes bold and higher, wishing to reach the stars through his momentous production. In that, he is simply that one who is in the world and earns his part: in that, he is limited, but happily declared to his mere ability to then appreciate and tribute.”

   Up on the hill there sits a tree. On this bank of ours, we have toiled the soil as to be rich and nourishing, wherein the roots can dig and hold deep, allowing the trunk to grow strong and firm. As well, that pillar supports itself through the sap it produces, ‘as if the pores from our solidity break out of the mold and harden the edge’. At the bottom of the rise, flows a stream. On and on it will go, though our limits suggest its presence will be temporary when it comes to us. Making haste, we labor the steps and stones, to bring back the means for nourishment and drink. In doing so, the tree becomes well founded and tall. As it grows higher and true, it takes in more of the sun’s rays, ‘whereby the development process is cemented, and it is set to continue being and becoming strong’.
   <br>&emsp;The light on offer gives an impression, of all that is green and gold. This interest and draw brings us out of our casing, whereby the tree blooms towards the sun and her ways. Moreover, if we are stably treated to this creation of ours, then we can take the little we need from it, and re-invest for more future gains. This contribution proceeds into the addition of branches, as extensions; here, more room for fruit and leaves are available for that rigor coming in and the roots beneath to flourish and generate something great and wonderful.
   <br>&emsp;As we take the fruit and bloom of these offerings, several things happen. The value in supporting the system becomes meritable and worthwhile, whereby the access to the stream becomes ripe for industry and effective development; moreso, will you as a person and agent become kind and amenable to what those means take. As an agent who has a limit, your regard can sprout from these grounds, wherein they mold themselves to the path rooted in this way; here, the offer is forever and light, whilst the lesser weight allows you to further contribute as well as personally being more. It is that most latter that reflects the purest ambition. As someone, being well ordered and tuned is a principle cause and demand; in doing so well, the need for its doing becomes proficiently met, ‘and the way is leveled’. In this space of grace and stability, you may offer yourself to things more liberal and of study. Beyond the point of the green in your pasture, is the expression and bound of one who has improved from its nectar. In other words, the goods you have received from the forest and the stream, allow you to be actionable onto things and activities in and for themselves. “It is of the greatest claim in which a mind and body has the most prolific and joyous experience.”
   <br>&emsp;Regularly and round, will the reach and make for these ends of your development treat you to a place that bears prominence in its offering. “Whereby the flourishing and blooming state of your heart and soul dances and sings as far and high as you can push it.” From this, your experience will relate to the congruency and fecundity of the tree. In that case, the ground holds the offer, wherein the roots and trunk stake themselves deep within; the leaves and the canopy flutter ever more to the top as the base becomes better set below. “Thus you are given the sturdy grounds for your own personal offering.”
   <br>&emsp;More than the additions and tribute to the tree and stream, your real take from this stability is that your interest and aims can set themselves to be infinitely higher. Whereas the trunk sits firmly on the grounds of the earth -wherein it can hold the nourishment that other things need- you can take its treatment and apply it forwardly, onto and for yourself. In that, the peaks will be ever more prominent, ‘as the sky and your dreams carry you as high and far as you can treat them, whereby you pillow and bloom, like the cloud’. In that, I will illustrate the difference. Whereas the tree will bloom outwards and with solidity as it gains permanence and care, you will shoot upwards and far, growing lightly and tremendous the more you put in. “Whereas one is bolted into and smothering the ground as it grows, your mind and achievement fills up and covers the open air, whereby the cloud of joy and feeling ease expands and balloons equal to and as much as you throw in.” In that last case, we are measuring ourselves through prominence, rather than completion.

<div id="natured">
   I have explicitly realized that our goal is not to reach further fortunes, or even find more riches and green in our pasture: it is simply and merely the case that we must clarify, expound and expand, decipher and decide, strictly and wholeheartedly explain all the means of our time in being, wherein we deliberately and forewardly define our home and aim. To the former, I mean the overview and assessment of the world and what it needs from me. We are industrious and rational creatures of course, and our actions as animals will be to respond and oblige to what seems posative; delivering a more accurate picture that illustrates the spots and holes in which we must and or should place our effort, marks the truth in our base foundation: on that, our house is both sturdily and comfortably built. I bring up that latter aspect because of the discontent one can have on wishing for something they cannot obtain; the feelings of failure and remission here can be removed and reinstated with more warmth and delight instead by seeing what the world and our place in it truly means, wherein the clarity of what is sound in our expectations becomes more prominent; consequently, we are not hopefull for things which have no real bearing and are not dissapointed without their possesion. In other words, bringing ourselves inline to an accurate portrayal of the world, will give us the means to a better end. Our goal then when it comes to this ground and its furnishings, is to be well placed in our assessments so that our actions are congengial to the truth: the congruency of which will then yeild the strongest claim. For reality is the utmost and thus our alignment and reverence to it will bear the furthest offer -for it is able to give the most, and equally then of value to treat.
   <br>&emsp;Why are we building this house though, or tending to this land? Ontologically we are ones set to have an experience; here, a point can be drawn that this production and toil can and does yeild a measure of that; is it the ripest and well met way though? My suspicion is not. Foremost, is the regard for that measure and what it would be best to yeild. As ones who live and are actionable [at this point we will say regardless of kind], then, ideally speaking, the ripest and most explicitly posative form is where the metric lives. Effecitvely, this reflects one who is totally invested, whereby their draw to fundamentals, or study, craft and other applied fields, is so high that they willingly and happily through themselves in. This rich and active participation means joy in the moment; across a stretch or period of time, we are said to be flourishing; when the solidity of our means and engagment is levelled as to enable us to be involved in this way in a consistent and prolific matter, then we can be regarded as propserous. This configuration marks the highest make, and in other words the fruits of one who is fully intouch and expereincing their rooted selves. The question though for man is beyond the admittance of his possession of a nature, or whether it is congruency which should then be met for that reason of flourishing, prosperity and joy. Mans troubles and problems are beyond this: for one who is in reality natured, is always working this way. It is merely the fact that what he thinks is time intended to improve something outside his core nature, is really a markedly false and error filled approach sprouting from his true essence." Admittedly though, that is hard to explain.
   <br>&emsp;It is the effort of man when it is not aimed at congruence to truth and his real ability to do so, that muddies his profits and result."To be ignorant of your nature is most false when your nature is the mould of reason and inquiry."
   <br>&emsp;Plainly said, it is how man uses and ordains his effort and care that solidifes and realizes the gains and use of his time; doing so then reflects the utmost need, for as ones with natures and, moreso, reasons to treat them, the specifics and pecularities of that mark our only regard -for this is where the dance between the world and our behaviours live. And onto that is where propiety and congeniality lie -whom of which guard and rule our means to a life of tranquil serenity.
   <br>&emsp;Adding to that, could 'a figure' help us illustrte the point of clarity within our foreward intentions. Given the congruence of reality and our nature, the active essence of this needs a mold; here, the generous effort which our congeniality is demonstrated in, has a place to go. Strictly put, the regard of one who is trying to live well through respecting their rooted inclinations, will deliver and sculpt the figure and form of the thing and place that they mean to and intend to express. Therein, the agent will have both a canvas rooted in ontology and ethics, but equally the scriblings of possible production and design. "Its quite simple you see; if ones personal tendency was to write, then writing well would encompass the sharp abundance of their efforts: to do so though is not merely achieved." I believe the case in point is in the whole idea itself. If the thing which will offer us the most posative expereince is defined by that which houses our largest effort, then the means for those efforts to be demonstrated and produced is the thing of our highest regard. The borders of our land are in our thoughtfullness, wherein our base needs are moulded and set to a proper view of the enivronment; additionally, is our spiritual and reverent guide born from the forefront of this -where we discover and learn what it means to flourish and thrive. Following this though, we can say that worry and regret is only onto the foremost thing, and that is our regard for what and how we will be onto the greatest end -and this reflects the need to mark the target and kind, wherein the attention we place is born from our nature and intracies.
</div>
<div id="prominence">
   Some time ago I mentioned the fact that those maturing would lose their nature upon maturity. The reason being, that once they were in line and set within the world, their actions would become congruently engrained, 'asking nothing from you'. What I said, was that if you were to thrive and prosper, then you must be deliberate and stout, whereby the constancy of doing so would leave the proper being to perpetually carry itself. I think that the word nature suggests a tendency, as if you were made to do it but effectively propped somewhere else. What I mean currently, is that having a nature calls on you to treat it well so that your actions are rewarding and soundly made. Foremost, must you recognize and consider all of your many intricacies, and treat them as if they are your priority. The mention of maturity before, is merely made on the grounds that this process is removed when the actions are no longer led down this course, and are instead housed there already.
   <br>&emsp;Practically speaking, can we say that as a being, you are in one of two states. The completed sense reflects that fact, whereby you are forever set and made -wherein the proper actions and congeniality have been dug out and bolted in. Secondly is our developing state. This situation marks the common norm, for we are in most cases less than who we fully are. The reason for this dialogue is to promote this fact, that we are ones with peculiarities and need of proper treatment. If we have squeezed out all but who we are within our behaviors and mind, then the mode we are in will continue soundly and with subsequence. If our nature is still present, then we must order ourselves and maintain our effort and time through that.
   <br>&emsp;I would like to speak to what that means, but I will propose something first. As animals, we are set in a relevant way; this set is limited, even as we are as men with tools and tech. "We all will at this point die. " The strength to the remnant of our need to then be responsible is fashioned in this natured manner; here, the resting point is that so long as our nature remains, so will our need to beckon; or, otherwise, if we grow out of it, it will be reasonable to suppose that this was from the prior steps wherein the nature was treated, 'whereby it is now fully entrenched and engrained and then offering a more furnished and complete set of which the previous developments were procuring'. In that, my point is that with the nature that we have now, will our use and treatment of that merely grow into a point of solidity, rather than removing the need for being natured at all. To reiterate, a nature is a bearing, a root of kinds and related tendencies; we say the one who is owning this and making it true, is mature and developing, and we say that one who has completed their quest and confirmed their essence with reality thick and through, will be regarded as mature and complete. For example, one with a talent for woodwork, will not lose their skills and use of them upon the point of mastery. In some sense, the steps of improvement are then no longer made, and you purely exist as one who is fully able to be.
   <br>&emsp;I must think on this and clarify the terms even more, but I can say that my target is the solidity of our nature's continuity. We can say that our bodies can forever remain; moreover is it feasible to suggest that our minds will keep going forever to. But what concerns me, is that even though all challenge and distress can be parlayed, so will our natures remain. The need for my focus here is to complete the sentiment from the ground up, giving regard for contentions and noncrucial aspects. What I can say however, and where the strength in this notion lies, is that for positivity to be claimed, then our existence as ones who are immortal and powerfully tuned, will our experience and time still be sensitive to our participation in it: Foremost then, must we uncover and decide, that if our nature will always be as one and remain, then the teller of good living and positive experience. will require and be made in our proper treatment of that. "Conclusively, does it then seem like our state will at best be one of prominence, however perpetual: for in all our greatest fortunes and maturity, ought we still be, or live that is?
</div>
<div id="existence">
   Underneath all of me there rests what I would through inquiry discern as existence, by the phrase ontology. My firmness and strength would reflect the development of my measure to be rooted and in accord with what that reality is, and our view and advance forward(with this accuracy) marks the presence of ethics. Moreover, as you bring yourself out into the world with this sounder scale, your disposition becomes more sharply molded to the world as it really is. On the flipside, are the wears and tears of one who did not but hopes to live this way. Growing up, if you have not been either thoughtful in making an objective, or successful and achieving the one you actually had, then your retreat into rational sobriety is barred with a natural impasse. Foremost is the fact that your aim has no bearing for it has not been developed at all; moreso, have your previous gains led you to a place in which you'd like to return, and this does not imply a state in which you are in the best position to newly define and then resolve to achieve. In other words, the strain and stress of common living cause friction towards a sounder objective and its advancement. Personally, I have never lived in a targeted space whereby outward and thoughtless aims were the objective set. My internal aims however and the goals that followed, were not completely whole in their intention, and having reached a place where the excess fat(so to speak) has been rendered off, my trajectory is still not as solid and firm. As one who is trying to be more deliberate and considerate, my advice is to take the shortest route and make for this lane with consistency and haste -for it in some sense is your new objective. Equally, as I would reflect on the way in which my purer place can be further embellished and sharpened, you can use a similar approach within your early progress as a more mature and promising form and technique. How one returns to a place of good and nature is preliminary by definition. "What I am looking for is how to hold the edge and sprout from here."
   <br>&emsp;From the ground up, the first principle is in owning the fact that you have a nature. Ontologically this is so if you can think and inquire -reflecting the fact that you are limited, and with somewhere to go - and theologically, means your end will be equal to the rest, as a tranquil and calming experience -like a deep sleep. Moreover, does having a nature reflect the need for proper aims and disposition. The principle here is twofold and holds our ethic. First, is regarding the fact that having a nature means that there is a congenial way rooted in how it is set, and is thus a harmony which is prime for you to flourish in being congruent to that. Secondly, is removing vanity(as learned or immaturely developed); this means that your expectations and interest are rooted in the actual demonstration of your effort and production, as well as the value made and provided. Vanity in contrast, is foremost when you anticipate a profit or reward based on what you have done or who you simply are; in other words, you imagine that things will positively happen before the activity is actually done, or based on an expected view born from self-importance. Simply put, if we as creatures of industry and abundance seek to obtain the means and rewards from doing so, then we must root ourselves in the hopes and ambition of meeting so, through actually doing so, rather than because we can.
   <br>&emsp;Shielding all of this is the real world. Underneath our purest reflections are those insights of reality and existence, and the knowledge gained which helps us develop stronger and opportune values and interests. Outside of this though is that real world. Only, that in front of us it rests in a malleable state, whereby our new instruments of interest and measure can be put to the test, or better yet used as material for our fuel as a sculptor. In doing so, our access to knowledge and inspection will be further made available, updating and improving our past notions of who we are and what we should seek, as well as existence's more accurate hold and housing, and all that this is set to expect and demand from me. Here, we can further our resolve, becoming more congruent with what actually fits our needs and treatment.
</div>
<div id="clarity">
   There is so much to say. I felt before that we were open and free, and set only with a resolve to consider and mend in and towards the truth. That understanding seems less important now. For example, I have attested to a grand piece of work, of which always seemed placed in front of less important work -as though it were the peak from those previous efforts. Now, since we are tasked with obligations and duties immediately, it feels as though our reason for meeting them should be sought and taken equally. In other words, instead of the past notions of letting things develop naturally, our way now is better set on a more firm and founded experience. In doing so, we can apply the reason and strength in which we have become composed.
   <br>&emsp;Foremost, is the clarity and development of our goals into aims. On this, I simply mean the smoothing out of rough edges, and deepening of our intentions and gaze. Put another way, the thing we truly wish to do should be dealt with clarity and unravelment, as to be more prominent in our reasoning for supporting the means to do at all. In that case, our duties will not be so draining, for a larger and well-rounded claim is clearly seen. Compared to a wider yet lighter approach, wherein the ease of life is tended to -and those activities and aims that follow- our position now is one that invites more firm and deliberate time and attention. In doing so, the tasks and demands placed far in front of us will have a truer and sounder gain to keep us going through. Moreover, will our despair of having to be responsible and dutied be more agreeable -for the reason of congruence is better said and explained.
   <br>&emsp;The mere mention of all and any aim seriously expands and embellishes the very means which support it. "Those which offer such, and in other words provide, make the overall harmony of asks and claims congenial to one another, and thus more easily amended." The advice I would give is to see the floor as if it were properly swept. The space is still what it is, and your request to be a participant is no lesser, but your view of the lane is more kept and tidy -if the condition is positively arranged. In seeing the way as it is in a sharpened condition, you can be accurately oriented. In seeing the place in which you are set, the groove for its offering is ripe and ready for development and contribution. That sentiment is truly the one in which reasonable happiness and effortless joy follow. In seeping yourself in it wholeheartedly, the aims and interest that you really seek will employ and incentivize you to provide and nourish them through the duties and responsibilities that are there for this end.
</div>
<div id="kingsgame">
   Objective truth is the hardest thing to come by. Having not known, I can at least say that my interest is in reflecting on and defining myself as a man. Not a dog or a fish, or a god or something high and absolute; merely one who can reflect, and admires oneself and roots their reverence as such, as one who is seemingly born yet explicitly made for thinking and inquiry -for it is what I am doing right now.
   <br>&emsp;The problem lies in trajectory. Actions, need a value for their prevalence to have any real stake, and declaring what that is fairs us a very tricky task. Moreso, am I unsure what it is we even need. "The adage goes that a king will ignore his council's plea, as well as his citizens suffering because no problem is in the way of what he seeks: he is already king." How I improve upon this though, is by deflecting the repercussions of that decision. In other words, by seeing it for what it really is, we can say that this direction for the king will ultimately prove to be unfavorable and bad. My motivation however in revealing the cracks in the pillar is rooted in the experience I have had that is beyond what the King is arrogantly seeing as good. From the ground up, we could use a different example of one who enjoys to drink and dine; reflecting on their satisfaction shows us that the consequences seen through wisdom are understandably shadowed by the wall of pleasures currently around. More concisely, the king in his case, is relishing his power and post -and all that brings. Wisdom suggests that the realm will at one time revolt -and those happenings are not so pleasant, of which our wisdom pleas to suggest. I do not stand firmly here though. My insight is similar to those who would see the natural consequence ahead, but I see something more promising elsewhere.
   <br>&emsp;Simply put, my position is struck in the place of the foremost experience. In that, my pleas against the King(if I had the time to be positively suggestive) is that before his naivety lands him in revolt and despair, that he ask himself whether the fortunes and desires he would otherwise fair -and subsequently cause that clout of mind- are worth it themselves, regardless of the consequence or not. In other words, the proposition of further gains is rooted in the purity of achievement. Moreover, is that success found in a greener pasture, 'whereby you relish and experience the strength and solidity of your heart and soul'. The specifics are to be applied after this discernment, but onto that latter we can boldly say (to the king) that the best and greatest times and feelings that you have, are higher and bolted above, wherein your own decency and effort bring you to flourish and flow with joy.
   <br>&emsp;My only point then, is that to this retched man who sits drunk and clueless, that rather than meet the unduly consequences, or tame yourself as to be more reticent and wise, that you hold yourself to something further and positive, whereby the risk of conflict and trouble are equally removed. "Nor will you have to be boring and wise: simply live for something higher and more."
</div>
<div id="thephilosopher">
   The reason is with respect to the gain of our progress. When we settle into ourselves, it is generally because the goods we seek are found personally, rather than from something outside. It is not that those things offer little, no; rather, the claims which bear us the most are of the kinds which are fuller and well founded, regular and abundant. “Those things which truly enrich our soul and hearts.” Things like sex, wealth and fame, these things are rewarding in the same way as medicines are helpful: they are specific in their effects based on the kind employed, and despite being substantial in what they particularly offer, only their presence can bear it so, and otherwise seeps the contribution if they no longer remain. These goods are at heart inconsistent and narrow, however high.
   <br>&emsp;In contrast, are those goods of reason. These aims come from things that are more rounded, as they come from and stay with you. For example, the respect and cheer brought from the world and her mold, burrows itself into you forever, for she is always there; moreso, the essence and workings of your mind are ripe for inquiry and appeal in any sort of place, be it of beauty or of horror. Moreover and ultimately, the contemplation and regard for the sameness and ease by which we reach and experience death, soothes any with a relevant nature to that. “In which they’d necessarily care.”
   <br>&emsp;The point I am trying to make is that the goods we seek, come from the congruence to the proper mold. Those completely within themselves are not doing this; they are removing the intrigue and grip from their senses as to be without the world and instead within. This is fine, preferable in some ways even, but besides the path of the rational animal. “The real way is one in which our mind and bearings are set towards the clarity and definitions set by it. Ought there be action though?” We are not trying to be clear as not to think, moreover are we not trying to be clear as to acquire the gains of our previous dullness; we are merely twisting our gaze as to be more congenial and set, so that we may bring ourselves more steadily and fair, whereby the treats of the world and our own generous posture can act and receive the contributions from the other. From there, there is a bliss harmony, for each is heard and treated.
   <br>&emsp;In summary, the ways of those foolish is too inconsistent and tough for me to have their aim; the ways of those without their senses, however removed from those foolish joys and ambition, have but merely rest: they are not living. “Is it not actions which we mean when we try and describe our lives.” My aim is one where I am contributing and thus living the most. This cannot be done to women, missions and or glorious claims, no; it is in art, literature, industry and me. “It is the forge of my soul and its strike from the brain that bears the widest and fullest path, wherein I am flourishing and robust, regularly until I drift away.” The point therein which I’d reach is what guides me, for it is the root of all concerns regarding this medium. As the agent and maker of strength in our time, it is my pleasure and friend to know such ends, for it means then that the means can proceed uninhibited, for we are unafraid and thus able to positively be. “Ought we step forward and firm though? Being still no matter the ease nor the ill founded bounds ahead seem to meet that standard. Let it be in actions bound towards our expected death, but happily, fully and well: for we are neither afraid or lacking wholesome ability."
</div>
<div id="truth">
   Our idea of things may be absolute, in that it is founded well and all-encompassing, but at the same time, be rugged and half cooked. For example, if we know how everything is, and in what way it proceeds, our impression and grasp on this may only be part way; in that, our view and stance on what is foremost is partial, even though it is of the utmost. In contrast, we may have a solid grasp on something, but it is of something smaller and less encompassing. In other words, we may have a lighter view of the world and our aims but be well entrenched and settled into its resolve. What we must regard then, is whether it pays to be forward but bare, or smaller yet firm; my feeling is that each state will become the other, as a point ahead which appeared to have more of an offer, will sooner or later become the place in which we strive from; moreso then, will the point in which we'd we reach if we were absolute, rest on a simpler point in which it is approached from. To all of that, we should be inclined to set forth, and move with height in our aims and stake, but relish the path easily, as we sit on the steps before the ones seen ahead.
</div>
<div id="inquiry">
   The fundamental point of inquiry is to whether the nature of your impression ought to be sifted through the lens of one who is or has inquired. Put another way, if you are making progress within your knowledge of the world, would the imperfection that correlates also render the proceeding results somewhat impure? In other words, if your knowledge is incomplete, will that alter the assessments ahead? Prominently, the nature of inquiry suggests that our register is not complete; if it were, there would be no inquiry, or need rather.
   <br>&emsp;That being said, if it is the case that our developments are made from points of lesser status, then the regard we have for those progressing, should be done with respect to that. There seems to be a necessary hunch based on our essence of not yet knowing; you could imagine that if everything was understood and known, then the truest and fullest assessment and judgment could be made. I feel though, as in most things, that this presumption rests on the pretension that we already know, and are just trying to find it as if we already contained the mark. The whole point of these distinctions, is that the mark is not ultimately known, for you have not reached the point in which you could. In other words, the aim of all things cannot be known until you have reached it; this is not to say that retrospect is required, but familiarity with something specifically, does suggest that you already know what it is - by virtue of knowing it with exactness.
   <br>&emsp;The question then is how we should be. My feeling is that this needs a more robust understanding and cleanse of our own nature of inquiry. Simply put, were are complexes of smaller things, by which we see other complexes; these impressions treat us to an understanding based on the essence of our senses: Our impression of the world is with respect to the figure we see of the things and their expression. It is the thing that hears and feels that heeds those around, grounding itself as the thing which we are rooted in, as to be our own personal vessel and mold of the world. In theory, there is a necessary hunch to this - as we are merely constructing a better image. At heart though, the point of understanding this is to help pasteurize our pretensions that we were made for something more. "Why is painting enough? Would our natures and thus actions remain, even if we had all things sculpted down to the tiniest bits of clay? Sure it may be useful to have some grasp, but won't it always reach a receding point based on what is useful for us?"
   <br>&emsp;It is as if the presence of inquiry entails that there is something we do not yet know; it seems that this inclination materializes in the need to know it. Hunch Theory is effectively the notion that if you know enough, you would not need to know at all. Effectively, if you knew that the correct way was likely, then bending yourself to the nature of that conclusion would yield the proper course. I believe our nature as progressive inquirers, leads us to a point where we can trust what we believe the most to be true; it is however the case, that this solution does not lead to more worry and concern, for I believe that the truth in this path is helmed through maturity; moreso, does its resolve relieve us of any ultimate need, as it soundly suggests that our being is explicitly temporary. "Since the well founded response is to merely meet this, as the end is known and being actionable is all we can do, treats us pleasingly and without remission. "For is there any need to then question what we should do? If so, would proceeding gently and expressively not reflect at least a kind of favorable way? Why ought there be more though?"
</div>
<div id="advancment">
   The issue we are facing, like all inquirers, is developing experience with something, and thus deriving its merits and claim from reflection. Here, values are developed as we consider what it is we like, as it had been and what we are interested in moving toward; from that, it is the most important factor that we engage in things and derive our constance through the result. On the flipside, we may look forward from the starting point of what would be good -in a theoretical sense. In these cases, some aim or value is tributed as being whole and founded, and thus the kind of result we should seek. The issue foremost, is that this does not consist of any clear road of what things will offer in this way. It is possible to discern that great riches will be profitable in the desired aspects, but this presumes to know what great riches are. If we had great riches already, then we could say which aspects of their nature were worth avoiding and seeking. "Yet how would we otherwise not assume that being King was what this amounted to? For is that not what great riches are?" In our previous case though, someone has a view of things based on expectations placed from their starting position; moving from there, they may reach that point, but find out that it did not hold the gains they were seeking. That is the heart of the problem, 'for seeking the crown may otherwise be foolish'.
   <br>&emsp;The issue is that they had a deliberate gaze, and were seeking what would constitute a good life; in that resolve, they pursued things with respect to that but were ignorant to the nature of those things as they were when viewed from that point of successful experience. Put another way, if we straighten up and become wiser in what we seek, then we must also suspend our judgment of what things mean until we reach the point in which a stronger ground for assessment can be made; in other words, if your idea of gold and fear is born out of a view based on your current scenario, then the aim of those things will be based on an assessment that is rooted from a lesser place -in that is was prior. It is wise to be set in the kind of life you want to be, but it is folly, naive at least, to assume what things and ambitions are with respect to our bias and foresight.
   <br>&emsp;The reason for saying this is to remedy this mistake of presuming that things will fall in accord with our beliefs of them. Instead, we should acknowledge what we know already and let that be the mechanism that guides us further. That is, if we reflect upon our experience thus far, then tailor an insight into how we want to be. "Knowing this will thus give us a personal criteria for where we want to be." For example, if we realized that we were full of ill prudence and regret, then our goal should be to mend ourselves, seeing then what the world seemed with respect to that. Simply, we could look at someone drunk and the lens of their inquiry being all murky; it would not be foolish to sober up and pursue better things, but any impression you had of things in that previous state would not be legitimate as an aim. Our natural progression is headed straight forward, and thus the meaning of things can be more sound as their relation is to a constant path. Compare this to our initial route, wherein we were bound to turn around: the definition of things from that path, are not well founded -or likely round- as they were based on a lens which was poorly oriented.
   <br>&emsp;The advice I would give then is to orient yourself when it comes to the core of your actions and aims. Removing rusty interests and ambition, settle into yourself and find the possibility of a sounder claim. Taking steps from there will see all things that come your way be sifted through a stronger measure, allowing for more substantial profits. In mending your own being as to be congruent and set, then your development will hold things with a proper hand, as they are held and needed to reach a sounder target, born from your newly founded aim.

<div id="reproach">
   As for the most prominent and ill-found question, is how we should spend our time. If we truly could know, then this would be the highest claim within our ability to reach anything at all. To what that measure can bring, here is how it is found. Rooted in our nature is a lineage of not yet having known; more and more do we acquire, but we are never fully grown. “Not till we knew it all could we say what all is, and thus our assertions and claims are partially ill-founded, for we have not yet reached a point whereby we could stand firm onto absolute gains.” From this, we will presume our nature. As our first principle, we can easily address the proper route, and thus response -wherein our highest claim is reached. This is simply the case, whereby our knowledge of what is, becomes so much that we are confident in knowing what it is like to be besides all, and with not. In contrast to knowing all and thus making an absolute claim, we can at least be well founded in our place with nothing. “Only those who will be all should and can reach a point where this point is known. For those who will return to lesser points, our goal should be the remedy of striving to live as if we were otherwise, but remove the fear of being unknown instead, and thus rest merely on the notion that all will be fine, for the ground floor of nothing bears our only claim.”
   <br>&emsp;My resolve that is from this is simply to confess the ignorance we have, of not yet knowing how much it is we do not know. “Firmly, my place is one where ‘nothing’ has the aim: for I am set apart from all things other.” Otherwise, we will be restled in acquiring more, and resolve ourselves into the means of reaching full enlightenment. People like this are issued an all too founded find, and consequently have little strength in the position that they seek. Instead, my resolve as from and to matruity’s treat is to bring that stake closer to ourselves; in doing so, the firmness and shape can be solid and rounded, smoothing itself out towards a finer claim: that purer gain is the root of our target. Knowing enough, we are then aware of our ability to even know so little. Upon our understanding of that, will our eye retreat towards the grass and pastures of our soul, happily accepting its place as one who is meant to simply graze. Moreso does this point treat those who are made for it, with a grand and oathfull flourishing, for this is congruent to them if their nature be as such, and thus they are treated to the blooming of one stout and true within their appropriately founded claim.
   <br>&emsp;That is our path as ones who are limited, to be insightful and allow it to seep heartily and lightly into our heart and bones. This is not the case for gods and men, merely Man. He knows this is true, for it is his limit of sight when used, that buries him deep into his own nature, wherein he senses and sees his own and common path; hereby the treats of the utmost good and grandeur are there for him if and when he signs his pact.
   <br>&emsp;Since our kind is well when we do what is rightly so, then we can say that we are sound in that alignment if the fruits of congruence are prominent. When this is the case we will know, for we will see that our nature is properly set and that the well faired happiness of being sound and round is acceptable to be deemed positive and worth our oblige. Through that offer, of our use and way, will the time and prospects of the steps ahead be revealed, in which we can see the mold and size of what it is that is our actual treat. “It is the nature of that gain then, that professes the necessary reflection onto those who have not yet seen it.” What must be remembered is that those points ahead are set within a situation beneath us. That is, if our time is bent towards a sleeping end, then so ought our actions bring us there appropriatley. In that, should our current wonderment of the living abyss ahead, be reproached upon for a humble limitedess, wherein we settle ourselves into a life which respects the fact that it will end. For in that, will our time be pleasent and easy; moreso will it be happy and abundant, as it fears little of losing something. “Death is our permanent claim, and so to our amendment for it.”
</div>
<div id="mindfull">
   It is clear, that when nothing is known, all will we see, for in that not, we are set and bound to the root of all things, as, like us, they are bound and made from the same. I propose that we conclude that our action and intent be set and revered on its resolve to meet this point in the greatest way, trusting that finality treats us all the same. Knowing this is true, we can marshall our nature as to be congruent to the world and her nature with respect to this. If, for example, our actions spurred reprecussions after death, then this would be a concern; seeing as they do not, our considerations need not align.
   <br>&emsp;The great question of our inquiries though, is how then should we be. Naturally, we see the world as best we can; through vision, smell, taste, sound and touch, an image is made. If one of these were gone, then we could not expect to respond as if their takes were part of the impression. That being said, I would say that beyond this figure that we design, it is reason and our intellect that marry us towards the proper thing to do. However, it must be said that in contrast to this, are more basic and primal compulsions, whereby reason is lacking. In that infant state, the impression of things is equal to those of a higher mind; the difference though is that where they are drawn to is rooted in pleasure and desires, whereas in the realm of reason, our response is more deliberate and thought out. Forewardly I'd state, that the very nature of our inquiry suggests that our stance in it suggests the need for clarity and strength in this kind of measure, that is, towards a reasonable response. Comparing this to those baser inclinations, a considered and well set thought is not required, for the essence of that way is based outside of such qualities. "It is only in the realm and use of reason that sensibility and assumptious defense is worthwhile or necessary, as these mark the nature of this way." In practice, defining and sharpening our view of the world with respect to its relevance within the use of reason allows for our actions to accordingly follow; otherwise, our mind will have nothing to sensibly grip onto -and baser impulse will be our guide instead.
   <br>&emsp;This point is what's worth addressing. Similar to one's notion of a figure born of the basic senses, the response we have to those is equal to that which we would have to reason; if a rational response is one of thought and care, then we must also be clear -as we would be to the construct of some thing, reflecting its make as seen through our eyes for example- to the workings and nature of time, mortality, order and aim. Without these as rational scaffoldings, our treatment through reason will be equal to those who see a rounded object, but assess it as being square. Note, that this does not affirm how the response should be made, but rather the quality of the impression -so that it would at least be sound. To clarify, our intention and use of the mind must see things that are based on things more than constructs; in that case, the base senses make the figure; in the case of our minds, expectations, consequences, short and long-term effects etc. are being concerned with, surpassing merely the shape and trunk of objects and things; instead, we are centering on and defining them more elaborately with respect to what they actually do. In other words, we need a means to see things with respect to how they would appear within our effective use of reason.
   <br>&emsp;That being said, we should add the proceeding point about how you determine what you should actually do. We have clarified that the composition and figure of an object, plus the workings of it and what it means over time, meld together to be a well sensed and thoughtful depiction. Considering that our assessment is strong, what should our resolve be? As a base example, you might say that something which is sweet -overly for the sake of argument- will exert pleasure and grogginess. Onto our senses, we may only see and thus respond to the former, whereas reason can see the consequences and bar you to oblige. Our question is strictly to say 'how should I treat this?' If the heart of the answer reflects the treatment of senses and desire, this we could say is irrational, whereas if the treatment was done so based on the ends and consideration born from reason and care, this could be concluded as being rational. The foremost question then of this inquiry, is whether or not we should treat things with compulsion or soundness. It seems that the nature of the former will be initially pleasing but followed by a lack of what you had before. The latter however, despite seeing less frequent spikes of pleasure and treats, may find more consistency within a broader range of situations. On top of that, I would add that this kind of being relishes itself as being so, based on the notion that such consistency is on our side; consequently are we are pleased with ourselves for being well administered and tuned; moreso, do we take confidence by virtue of the expectations which we have accounted for. Compared to those prior treats, one might say that their good is lacking; as with any thought or stout marshaling, would they appear as only bad. "Even an ape, or a fool of a mind for that matter, would at least lean towards the criteria of that. Only the latter rarely sees it until he is submitted past the point of true favor."

<div id="imperative">
   So what should we do? Be within the limits and stake your place beneath the king as the pawn. Simple. Know that it is a reduction though, of humility that is, rather than presuming yourself inferior to things higher than you could know. In other words, the limit of one is reflected in their ability and need to inquire; the reflection on this does not prescribe that we employ ourselves to be moved outside of this condition. Ontology suggests that something absolute will never be less, and will thus never be anything short of all things now lesser - necessitating that you will always be beneath its hind. That you are reaching then reflects the continuity of your way: and it is in that make that your nature is established, guaranteeing that there is a suitable case to be. "It is in the state of being that one's particular(of being) will have a certain fit which bears a better experience[the reel of being]."
   <br>&emsp;The distinction for man is in the remedy of whether our nature began -and if so of what kind- and whether then it will end -and then onto what we should define. It feels outside of this there would be no regard. It feels simply that because our consideration is present in this reflection, that the implications of having 'a' regard are in place: and that seems to be the condition of one beneath an absolute limit. What a nature means then gives us a palatable line, wherein the roots and seems of that are able to be strictly and thus profitably defined. Here, the effort and time for us is markedly set and placed; and its strength in being so is principally due to our resolve being the congruence of one who gives(and is showing) regard.
</div>
<div id="tendencies">
   This seems very simple yet applies very well. Foremost is because it grounds itself in the distinction of our base and behavioral dispositions and conveys the difference in the kind of result when each are done rightly and well. Effectively though, there is something that is lacking for us to bank the highest return. On the back side, we can be said to look for accurate measures of the world so that both foolish expectations and rightful opportunities are better explained. Moreover, would it be common and wise to reflect on our composition as it is relevant to that; therein, we could scrutinize and define the base needs we have in a more elaborate and deepened way. In doing so, we would remove the hopelessness of luxury and faulty success, as well as improve and further our knowledge and orientation around those fruitful scenarios that require our constance to achieve. Or, in other words, those things which require more consistency benefit from us knowing what it is they truly offer, so the benefit remains a target to be sought, rooting in a thorough amiability in order to bring out the claim. With this aim and means of our base nature better explained, I am unsure whether our intricate and expressive nature has been given equal care. Comparing the two sides, we would want to define what those particular aspects of us were, then elaborate on the world in which they would partake in. My feeling is that the keystone of this forefront sentiment lacks any place, and thus the body of it is given no regard at all. That is the fact that even if our personal understanding and place was well known, it would not entirely or effectively describe what we can do. For example, considering that we are industrious and that doing so is best done abundantly and prolific, then we could see how a wide and open amount of effort ought to be applied where it can; we may see then that the active nature of this concern means that activities that draw us the most will fit the measure best, those being various kinds of crafts, studies of literature and our own creation, dialogues and analysis of great works including essays, games, shows and film. Moreover, could our own training in strength and recovery be given equal attention and treatment. This seems like a sound casing for our active interest.
   <br>&emsp;The problem lies within the heart of the difference between our possessive needs, and our expressive ones. On the former, the results are mere possessions. The effort required is temporary, as the achievement of it hits the mark of success. In contrast, our active interests need consistent tending to, as if their reward were similar to the kind found in a garden. “So long as we tailor and toil as to make the effort flourish and bloom, then our interest will return to us the goods of proper treatment: it is from a successful state though.” Success is generic in our use here, but we might distinguish its application to those used in matters of acquisition and those of congeniality. For means of better fortune, success will be reached upon the arrival and gain of property, and its maintenance and continuity will be furthered by the upheaval of rights and deeds -like income to pay renewals from a lease for example [the rite to it though is cut and dry in what it requires to remain]. Our personal effort though is aimed at consistent and abundant joy. Success here, is found through the congruency of activities and interests that house the engagement of our particular nature and way. The result though differs from a physical asset in that the reward is a state of existence, whereby its heights are of a blooming state, rather than a final position. Effectively, only as long as we will ourselves towards congeniality, and abstain from being ill sought and composed, will the measure spark anything significant. Between living well and being well off, the difference is in the metric. Thus, although fortune provides rest and stability, so to does natural congruency offer tranquility and joy. “And for me, the latter feels more a like fruit, whereas the former is more like sturdier bark on the tree: one is sweet, while the other is supportive.”
</div>
<div id="action">
   Firmly and strictly put, the most important thing for one who intends to and is thus fortuned to be able to use their time, is in how they are going to spend it. "Life is short and quickly lived; death however comes far and away: we should make sure to use the former with haste, as the latter is necessarily eventual." This sentiment has given me the notion of a figure; here, the subject is given, from inspective virtue, the most detail and care. The reason why reflects our active abilities, but our base use of them onto what we see: and onto that we ought to be sharp and accurate. What the many figurines share in common, is their need of this proper description, but equally, our congruent resolve.
   <br>&emsp;In plain terms, our view of the world marks the way in which we will engage with it. The measure for our success then will be if the efforts we placed are well founded and true -for in that the real world will be properly reflected, making our congruence to it promising and sound. From this there is a method; within this, there are two proper regards, one being the world and it's ways, as well as what we ask for, and thus what it requires to oblige. The former ought to be discerned through scrupulous assessment, so the environment is accurately known, but so too should our own intricacies and proclivities be discovered. For in their case, we'll have a personal and well fitted measure, or scale rather, in which things can be judged against. Those that fit the bill and agree with our truest selves, will earn our consent as proper objectives and treatment. "These things feel like they ought to be known."
   <br>&emsp;The question I have though is whether or not the format we develop -of insight into who we are- is rooted in a fundamental way towards the fact that we can consider at all. In other words, "is this more deliberate approach a mark that is to be reflected in the results determined?" It seems for one thing, that determination will be the case; at least, we seem to be able to and benefit the most when doing so -and this ability to do so well does suggest that it is in part a function(of us).
   <br>&emsp;Partially, the struggle is that our thinking reflects a state of unknown; thus it is hard not to believe that such an action is not the paramount thing about us. "For, if we knew everything, then we would not need to think at all. If we didnt though, then what else would be of value then reaching that point; and seeing as we are moe like the latter, does suggest the according conclusion -of valuing the thinking contained."
</div>
<div id="vritue">
   The definition of virtue is the excellency of what it is you are formed to do. A clear example is the blade of a saw, and how its sharpness reflects a virtuous state in that its goal is to cut." In that sense, our consideration of how we should live might be a prominent suiter for assignment. In other words, if our aim is to provide insight into our function, and moreover then to provide the material to use it -wherein the activity is of virtue and thus harmonious- then is there any strength in supposing that our ability to inquire is a forefront to our nature? Or rather, does that core ability within us, suggest both the vessel were best to use, and thus what things are good based on their appropriate place within the use of that? Effectively, this discernment gives a mere stability and wholeness to the casing around our mold. Personally, and as it would likely be for one in any case, the things which deserve and or command our attention and effort is in some ways obvious. Through a simple inspection of who we are and what we genuinely seek, can we level the ground with clear and solid intentions. In doing so, you can produce an objective that is formed and figured with respect to your particular nature.
</div>
<div id="kinds">
   A crow and eagle are equally birds: only the latter though is a bird of prey. Of a kind then, we are, as animals, rational. That we would be so efficably reflects our nature being prominent - wherein the roots of our kind have matured and developed. Just as an eagle who cannot catch his prey or fly very well still is a bird of prey, its integrity as one - to which we would refer to as a solid member of the kind [who displays their nature well] - is limited and ill advanced. This does not change what it is though. Tendencies, aims, desires and worry are all set to be a certain way within a certain kind. Not all kinds will have this - like a rock - but to those who do, the question is beyond the mere prescence of these things, and rather how they are in particular to the ones of a kind. "What are the right objectives of one, or poor ones? What should one of these be worried about, or look foreward to? Moreso, what should they aim for and avoid?" These are all prospects of how a thing should be. Having, for example, an objective, is too general to say that you are a kind that has one - you might be better of relating yourself to those with a nature to breath. It is of what kind of objective and interests, or needs and worries, that reflect the personal mould that fits us properly. The personal nature that calls this though , reflects the peculiar ascpects of a member within the kind: the acting of which makes them unique within their rooted assembly. The bread and butter of this is that our own congeniality is that which reflects those things particular to us: they are brought to us though throw the lense of that shared commonality: therein, we may have our own edges, but they are the details of a similar form. For example, we may all be industrious, and rational in our expression of it, but what we build will be varied and different. What decides this is a specific point to the discussion. The overall heart of the sentiment though is that whether it is short buildings or high towers, that these are mere emphasises of a shared composure and its expression.Therein, the personal production is one that reflects our own motives, tendencies and interests, but they are helmed out of the complex of which we and other members share. "We are rational animals, and onto that rationality we are born to share. That we would be rational then suggests our rooted place as the group of humanity: our own expression then, however varied, is shouldered by the casing from those who are in their core the same. And onto those actions that are personal and unique, they are bent and settled within the nature that reflects our fuller kind - wherein our own experience operates in, where we are individuals, but as ones of a kind."
   </div>
<div id="therationalanimal">
   <br>&emsp;It would not be self indulgent of me to explain why a man ought to know how to live. Moreover, would I remove the need to explain that he is one. In other words, if man is the rational animal, and rationality is the means and care to extract another’s nature, and make it relevant to oneself, then I would simply compare someone who could do this and who could not, by the mere difference that the one with reason is deliberate and actionable -while the other is less interested and able to perceive and proceed. That nature to understand then, suggests to me that the very heart of doing so reflects the root of one in such position. What does that mean though for that person, or thing rather? “If you have a mind, or more fundamentally are just able to regard, won’t it become true that this sense in some way turns in on itself? Furthermore, would your very ability to have actions and the means to choose them, justify the need for reasons which are more substantial than others? To that, I would clarify that our very nature to ask and inquire reflects our benefit and gain from doing so greatly, and onto(and thus from) which can be regarded and charitable in the foremost.” To this latter notion, could we briefly and commonly describe our quest and plea as the mere intrigue and conquest to know and understand ‘what is the meaning of life’. In other words, what is the strongest reason that holds me to do everything I do, or rather what thing will surmount all other decisions and guide us, or at least treat us to the most grounded and earthware lane? “By which all other actions can act through and towards, wherein we can then effortlessly and prosperously be.”
   <br>&emsp;How then shall we proceed? I would say that foremost, our regard and inspection settle itself into the nooks and crannies of our nature’s regard. In other words, if our nature is to ask and think, then our very essence of doing so should onto itself as one who is of the kind. Effectively, our ability to ask implies that our resolve be tuned to the answer we found. We have already detailed that the primary quest for reason entails a resolve to the truth discovered; our concern then is what that furthest response to our inquiry is, and what our path to treat and revere it ought to be.
   <br>&emsp;To the crux of our inkling, is the fact that we are limited.This is explicitly so for we know not all, and are thus less than absolute. “How could we need to question or be unsure, if we were all in total? Moreover, if we were total, would questions even be achievable at all?” To that, I say that our very ability to ask, as well as our inability to give complete answers (to fundamental things), suggests that we are limited. Put another way, our place as inquirers is truly equal and the same as those who do not know, for at most we as the inquirers sit afront the line, whereby we need to and can ask. “That domain though fairs us all a limit.”
   <br>&emsp;What is it for, I find myself asking. I am one who will die, but I am only sure of this from a valid deduction. The place and use of logic though is steeled into our uncertain minds. I cannot say this one way or the other for sure, even if my hunch and queries are based on regular happenings. The issue I believe is that for ones who know a great deal, we still have little regard for the fact that we know little at all. We generalize of course, and can attribute our kind of happenings as being similar across other relatable groups, but were encompassing, rather than being with them. Moreover, are the fundamental questions of death, finality and karma(so to speak) unknown in the strictest way. Consequently, as a game which had no known end, our resolve to be in the game and play a certain way is absolutely unfirm, and lacking anything but the utmost strength. In other words, we cannot know, or at least we do not know, and thus our resolve and steps forward are at best, rooted in what is likely -and thus a development that is strong, rather than surely true.
   <br>&emsp;The issue lies in those who can think regarding themselves as thinkers, rather than beings with thought. More specifically, I mean that we are animals with the ability to reflect and inquire. Our senses are still the same, and our bodies are still their old sort of meat, nerves and bone. These have come together though in a way in which the sounds that we once made -similar to other animals- have sharpened and straightened up, to the point where complex and subtle meanings can be expressed. Moreso, can we derive the greetings of these words and phrases, assimilating them in -as if we had our own sophisticated registry. From the ground up, it might be useful to simply consider our industry, humility, collaborations and mind, as traits and or qualities. In other words, our ability to speak well and think highly, are mere behaviors and abilities based on natural development. What this entails, is the reverence and care of one who can peer in and regulate themselves. As a being though, we are doing this; the flipside, gazing at the far front, is that imagination, resting and caring for things other than its house: it has become the manor. “And that is the paramount distinction.”
   <br>&emsp;If the mind which treats itself cannot reach full fruition, then are we to believe that this is the soundness way? In contrast, if the rational animal could fully be and live unto their purest way, would that not mark the place to be? This rests on the assumption that the right way to be and envelop is the one with the proper gain. In other words, some things might be objectively better than others, but if you are set for something other, then measuring yourself to be congruent and greeted by that has more warrant as the way. It is sure to think that love from men, or thought from their minded being, has more abundance and cheer than the simple harmony from the swimmings of a fish, or flight of a bird. The question then, is it better for the bird to reach higher living through more intricate and rich facilities, or is it better of doing what it is better set and born to do -whereby its heights are met by the winds of the sky, rather than the soaring gullies within our mind. At heart, this sentiment describes the nature one has as being the truest aim and reward from being demonstrated. And there is strength to this, and whether most applicable or not, it at least is solid to stand near the front of our regard as a model which is worth admitting. The question though, is how do we know. If we cannot and do not, how is there anything we can properly say that has any bearing? “When you play soccer, your position is moved and set by the confines of the rules and of the game; keep the ball within the lines, push up and play for the aim of scoring. In life though, how could you tell whether you should play soccer or not -despite knowing its own rules. For what does the game of life require?”
   <br>&emsp;My concern here, is on the two likely suppositions. We are the mind and reaching ever on through it, so that we know the most and develop it further; or, we are men who have the abilities of the mind, but merely turn inwards and use it as a better means of harnessing and materializing our truer selves. “The remark made by Epictetus has some fair here. He says simply that talent, for example, is well known by its suiter. The example of a Bull is given, where it knows it can and must stand and fend off incoming lions and threats; a small child on the other hand may know that they have a knack for and wish to proceed through some common craft.” What I suspect, is that our intention and adherence to the minds developed offerings is mistaken for the way in which we proceed -as opposed to resolving to treat and place ourselves in the things we discovered. In other words, our ability to think has given us the impression that our place and time is set and pillared on the advancement of thinking. Similar to the talents of someone, those skills are onto a thing, of which they are personally not: it is something they have.
   <br>&emsp;The reason I struggle here, is that if we accept our place as one who thoughtfully proceeds, then I see and am barred by a host of presumptions and assumptions -foremost as to why we are doing this at all( the unknown hyperbole). Not only can I reduce things through a well rested nature of my own, as to see clearly what my place and kind is, it merely serves me better to address myself as the thing which bears both the qualities of reason, but the thing served by them upon their gain. From that, it is much easier to acquire true and abundant meaning. Forwardly, it is the interest I have and orderliness of the instrument of extraction, that reflects the fact that this is what is meritable in its importance to me. In other words, my very interest to ask, along with my excitement and care to make use of the answer, suggests what reason is used for in me, and thus what I should do. “For I am then a thing, a being, an animal, who is acting confidently and just, onto and from reason, of which my make and gain is truly and soundly made.” That is the rational animal.

<div id="judgement">
    To do with our assessments and there relevance to us, the most prominent distinction, when it comes to us, is the fact that we are conscious. If we were not, what judgments could be made? It seems as though, if right and wrong(or value in general) is attempted to be defined, the very nature of you being able to ask and inquire, somehow impacts the scale for those things and their measure.
    <br>&emsp;In contrast, things without the ability to think, naturally go their way, drifting like seaweed over the ocean tide; we are not this way. We are rooted with similar intent, though, our faculties have some grip for us to steer, being deliberate as we please. "To see things for what they really are, including us and our way, draws on us to be accurate and kept, so we may peer with precision. Without this, we are similarly floating, for our sense bore no stay."
    <br>&emsp;There is an orderliness to the common life, for it knows not that it will die, or end. As light becomes clear, and sound and noise become pronounce, the orphace that holds impressions becomes aware of itself, that 'we' are hearing and seeing; focused attempts can thus be made. My feeling though is that as much as we are aware, by our simple senses, to which animals share, the concentration that covers the basics sees that the end is coming, and that if we do not direct ourselves with clarity and intent, it will unknowingly pass away. This is why we care, and wriggle when doing nothing; we know were wasting our time, that we are withering away. "Only in life, in living, do we forget that this will end. In our rest though, we are wise and tenable, to reflect and appreciate that this is both our way and blessing, having lived and seeing that, although temporary, we are free and plentiful in our ability to support and relish the experience of being." When we ignore that, our idleness springs an alert, for we feel like nothing; as if we are unable to live. It is best to die and be dead than be alive but feel little so. This is why our conscious forbitity is worth regarding; it tells us that reason guides the way; only, that which passes the test has done so with those respects, for living had our aim. Vice and insolence are rooted in that common living - being passive seems thus the wrong way to go, by its corollaries, of poor action. Being aware draws us to treat ourselves with care, for we know there is a limit in our way. Without strength and aim within our attention, no gain is made, for congruence is lacking. "There is no mold to furnish our gains." Let us value the ability to do so and be mature enough to see that being conscious is the real claim; as it guides us to live, and holds our worthwhile claims. Like a soldier and his sword, we are inseparable. The battle is won by those who try, for in victory and defeat they remain in their condition, and thus keep at rest, tranquil and blessed, in living and death.

    Perhaps, simply, the very question bars an answer. If you are asking a question, and your faculty to do so brings further inspection onto 'the one who is addressing', then you might say that the uncertainty of what 'you' should do, is clarified by addressing the nature of the very one which is inquiring. If I were a rock, I would just be, without apprehension or activity. As a man though, I have direction; my ability to be as such engaged, comes either because(or alongside) of our very ability to ask, or at least make an impression. That intake, of the world, surely draws us to be a certain way. By the means of discernment, that faculty (in response) desires harmony and thus asks the whereabouts of these impressions - as that would seemingly give guidance to our way. What are senses do is simply let us know what the world is and how it responds to us, that it takes cold and brings warmth, bears hunger but also yields satiety. "By my nature to ask, in many ways suggests what the answer should be, can be, and whether or not it would be favorable or not: for will I not ask further questions? And if so, ought the profit of those results be in line as to support that?"
    <br>&emsp;This planet of mine is born through geology, rooted in the dust clouds dispersed amongst the remnants of previously formed stars. From the chaos that geographically ensued, life and its preceding constituents emerged, forming further complexities defined by a response to the environment. It is said and consistently shown, that all things(in this case) are what they are through developments inherited and that those traits (themselves) promulgate due to the stresses placed on them by the environment. Our own species comes from Mammalia, which, compared to reptiles and birds, naturally has more intelligence. An Elephant picks things up with its trunk, Dolphins jump for joy as they spritz through the water, as do mice have a sophisticated taste for cheese. We are different though. As a result of our industry and construction onto the world, our faculties have concentrated. Sticks have a nature, as do rocks, and experimentally - when rubbed together - yield both spark and flame. The very development of this brings our primary concerns into simpler congruence, as our hunger and thirst(fundamentally) can be easier met. As in the stability and state of those amongst the islands and shores across the Aegen and it's seas, the lineage of humanity has come from comparable simplicities - with further insights and development being the subsequent consequence and reward. Beyond what is known, it is clear that our faculties and capacities have substantially changed; what they are employed for though, in many ways this remains.
    <br>&emsp;My overall inquiry is not to clarify the needs that need mending. Instead, I am looking to see the way things are so that I may demonstrate and apply myself toward what seems the right way to prosper and be. The greatest things fit a mold of good fortune and joy; in which spot they are placed is based on their essence and our judgment. The question at the end of the day roots itself, deeply, towards the concern and regard for the basis of that judgment. Judgment it would seem brings us to decide what and how we should do something and, thus, in general live. Things are as they are, becoming new through transition but remaining equal as members of the roster of things; as such, all have an essence and invites us to evaluate. Our interest in benefit will see that we do so with precision. Since we are the ones inquiring, and that we are aware that this is our rooted address, will see that our curiosities and inspections are given proper treatment and regard. In doing so, will our rational attempts be more full and rounded, and consequently more promising and fertile "So that our natures may be expressed well, and be then rewarded in a congenial way. In that, we've truly gained."

 <div id="assessment">
    Consciousness is best described by the stream of your moment, stacking concurrently from past to present. Our thoughts though, on the manner, reflect an imprecise measure of how this comes and 'streams' to be. One of the issues I suggest is that we have little regard for what absolute thought is, especially, when it comes to the sprout of our thinking. Most definitely then, should the ultimate thing be revered and assessed through the strongest approach. "Or in other words, if our aims are high, yet we are small, then we ought to be sound and well-founded in our attempt to proceed." Since this means something thorough, we must first come to grips with and define the constituents rooted in the assessment. The rule, in summary, goes as follows. Propositions are queries for success; they are made by those and only to whom would make use of them, making them rooted (in essence) to a means of reflection; moreso and to the point, that which you propose is a prompt for direction, that a certain choice or action would be taken for reasons that merit the claim being proposed. If we adhere to this invitation, then we have decided(as much as we are true to inquiry) that the premises are both sound in their use and valid in granting the proposal. I would describe our minds proceedings then, that it is not one, or 'a', rather so, being a state which proceeds, like a stream that merrily goes. 'That' current then is what we are regarding. With respect to the humanities, we would say that this clarity of what and how we are, as thinkers, works for our interest in making actual claims. The insight into the flow of and fruit of this inquiry merely boldens and satisfies the proper use and resolve of reason, where good choices can be truly made.
    <br>&emsp;With your permission, I will elaborate on the constituent parts. The gem of this is our value. Here, parameters are employed as a scale for things to be properly measured, then judged. We're looking for things that make us happy; regarding food, for example, this means something nourishing and fresh. What merits the claim of whatever houses these aims, is in things like robustness and strength, which earn their place as elements of our judgment, as our evaluation is bent toward us achieving those things. "Consequently, we can define our judgment through the criteria which gives the scale for approval." The care for how we wish to be, generally, molds the requirement for your advance. Things are inspected when it comes to that resolve, becoming what they are in how they relate to us and our aim. A pen is a writing tool; its composition is not relevant for the pure sake of scripture and thus bears no concern outside of its parts that are of interest to us.
    <br>&emsp;One of the struggles I personally face is that besides pure definition, the outputs of the function(so to speak) are helmed foremost to everyday decisions that I try and make. I am not a creator who is addressing the proper way for things to stabily proceed; I am a thing reflecting on the bones of that creation, concerned with my own decision so that my rooted interests are met; I am motivated by reason to be so congruent so that our own happiness and freedoms are met. "My values then are best defined in terms of what actions would be concluded as effective. Moreso, am I obliged to define this personally, and in the simplest of ways." I don't see anything traditional or divine in entirety; mine, along with many others, observe a nature to things and trust that they persist normally, remaining consistent with what we see. My place amongst those things is simply one who can impress, treated by the very things that float around me. Things which are further or of a grander sort - of an abstract kind too - are merely elements beyond my register; they are important, and almost necessarily elements which are prepped for our minds, but we are not them nor are they us. We are derived from them at best, but our impressions and resolve should be centered on us. Not them. "We are a fish in a sholl, bent by the ocean, home in the sea; I care not for Poseidon though, for I think not that he holds shrimp in far-off bays depending on my devotion; rather, he's set it aside for me already, and every other thing to. In that, I am simply concerned with air in my gills, and plankton to chew on." The point being that these are things which I desire and am thus ordained towards. My value thus follows, rather than being misarranged towards the one who gives. "My judgment is based on that which I've already received. Hence the graciousness."
    <br>&emsp;It is clear quite simply, that we are products of our environment. That our industry and directedness have become so prominent suggests efficiency within the system. What I would regard most highly though is that this structure remains. As a basic nothing wherein things proceed or the very mixture in which we are all held, there is a community of objects working amidst one another, networked and co-developing. The nature of consciousness then is a measure for this flowing state, noticing and amending to each and every changing moment, be it fully subsequent or proceeding. Our own regard for this comes from nature, as we are aware of her in ourselves - in that we are things that realize their own role in the game. Perhaps, in summary, of our attempt to conclude, we can say that our definite description is not single in its substance, and thus hard to know. "I feel though, the right to remain individual, resting on our judgment being as good as 'we' can get it." It is true that a better understanding can be reached, yet I suspect that it is our attempt to contain the 'whole' within an explicit description, that bars us from being more thoughtful and progressive. Put another way, our wish to make absolute claims keep us from making stronger ones, as our place within the former has our views being small amidst that ultimate reality; to me, there is more fare in a larger view, but of strength, or suggestion rather. We are small by nature, and thus our hope for the greatest of claims will see our attempts being futile and small. Illustrating the whole of things seems a better approach, as we can merely stand by a suitable depiction, rather than needing every minute detail in the portrait. "It earns us little to have such a tiny frame, even if every element inside is microscopically detailed. I prefer a soft and tidy picture of something large. For in that, I can see the whole."
    <br>&emsp;When we can see entirety in a way that is appropriate to us, we can advance our view of how it seems; our regard is meant for proper hunches though. Insight into what else is present only clarifies. We will personally be unable to grip and entertain the whole of reality in the strictest way; but let's not be small in our wish to hold something of the latter. Simply, we can address the fact that there is one, assessing what that means; our resolve then has considered the greatest thing imaginable, the idea at least. We were not made for the universe's registry, only the recognition of items and their place amongst the list. I do feel that a conscious definition can be claimed. I know however that my position is ultimately limited, even when I know all the entries. What I admit, is that despite being able to assess and remember every item in the store, I can regularly and reliably assess both the summary and incomes of the goods brought in and sold from the property. From that, a more suitable assessment can be made, and thus a more congenial scale for our judgment can be employed. "That is all anyone needs."

 <div id="gods">
    God is not necessary in precedent, rather it is a sound belief to attribute the name 'God', being oneness and throughout, as the idea that seems greatest to you. What is greatest must be God, by the attributes of what divinity seems, of presence and power throughout all of any entirety; whatever it is that seems to be that thing all-encompassing, assigned to that we will the label of God. Let us assume that there is a God, common and sound as one would know, or think to be - of monotheistic and traditional qualities. If we continuously stripped the essence of what amounted to God, where would we stop if we presumed to know what would at least still render this being divine? Perhaps its omnipotence, in power, or presence and state throughout. My bias suggests that it is knowledge, awareness at least of all that is. The greatest thing would amount to more than everything less than itself; only so much as you are greater can you be something absolute. Partially then, if something was only somewhat familiar with all things, then I would venture that they are no holy god, only partially.
    <br>&emsp;The furthest reach of entirety requires no control to be present. As a ball rolls down a hill, God need not pull it; his work has rendered the plains of existence to correspond in necessity so the ball, from the act of it being let(down), will do so by the presence of God's initial creation. "In that, he has already done enough." My point is that God is not one who exerts but is the entirety of all things and all things in their entirety. Their functions are natural as you would expect and their correspondence requires not admission from God and his will, rather that he be aware that they are following. "It is by his graces that you are able, having already paved the way." My thinking is that if he did not know whether you would fly or tumble outside of his interference suggests he is not aware of things as they are in themselves. "For how would the game maker not know the pawn's every move?" The assumption is that modality, as in the travels of things throughout existence, have their possibilities dictated by the interactions that spur them, rather than someone who nudges. Instead, the take of your make is done by the direction calling on the necessary path. God has made what is necessary so, not though that you would go.
    <div class="qu">If we find these depictions troubling or overwhelming at least, let us tribute William of Ockham's approach, where doubts and inability are rendered mute by only focusing on the key factors. By removing unnecessary concerns, will the primary elements be more digestible and exempt from judicious contention</div>

 <div id="mortality">
    The foremost thought, or regard rather, is of our mortality. In being so paramount, so to its description, which demands the highest avoidance of presumption and thinness. First, we must ask what it means, in death. Compared to life, where we are subject to horror and joy, nothingness bars any sort of impression. If that were merely it, then our knowledge of this would be based on confirming this as our theology and resolving ourselves through suitable ethics.
    <br>&emsp;One of the things which digs into our side here are assumptions. Generally, we wish there to be something from death. I feel this is because we are unclear as to what it would be otherwise, moreso, do we think and confound a notion of hell, besides this murky notion of time in death’s existence. The clarity I would propose rests simply on the notion of reverence for what is enough. “I will grant you the agreement of making for what is best, foolhardy or not. My question though, is that with a little ethical care and the removal of Paradisal ambition, would tranquil and neutral existence not be permissible, accepting at least?” If we think about the nature of nothing, we can at least agree conscionably to the nature in this proposition, that it is normal and amiable. An issue that is rooted here, in contrast, is the proliferation of ‘nothings’ reputation. We hear someone say there is no god or afterlife, and the response is ‘you beast, who hurt you’. My question is with respect to the heart of this inquiry. If our concern is of the utmost importance, then should we not treat it whole and full, roundly and with care? If so, will we not treat it with purity and strength, removing assumption and inaccuracy? Truly then, what is the definition we place on death in a natural way? This is not to disregard and collude away from more ‘traditional’ sentiments, but rather a illustrate a clear description. “We seem so sure about the norm, and nor are we opposed to seeking alternates; have these latter though been given any proper depictions? How then will we amend.”
    <br>&emsp;To give that side some bones and credit, hear the following. When we die there is nothing; that is what death is. In this state there is no sight or conception, for we are not and thus separate to what remains. None can follow or provide; nothing can scare you or bring you delight; there is no hope for nothing will change, nor is there fear ‘for no loss can be gained’. This is your end as it is mine: and the natural side of things bends us down this lane. In seeing this as true, we have materialized our greatest integrity; in doing so, the conclusion drawn is forewardly made for use in your stature;
    <br>&emsp;The closing is as follows. Because we can ask, we can make use of the results; thus we can treat and respond. If the knowledge of our death is that it is peaceful and free, then we can be sure of the good we are only guaranteed. What will that person do then, who knows their end: I simply say you be blessed, in your joy and cherishment of the way ahead. Be happy that the road is clear, for it ends cleanly and with ease. “This path is the one most followed, for it is reached by us and those the same.” Your thoughts can build and aspire to see and meet great things; find it in your mind though and know that it is true: temporarily will there only be you. In reaching such an end, let there be positivity on approach. Consequently, may you be so full and without grievance to leave, that the rest ahead brings no fear of the dead. Such good will bring you to jump right in, happily and satisfied with your life which reached this just end; you are done and ready to go, where living is no longer your state, merely rest. “Having the former is what makes the latter pleasing and acceptable.” One’s integrity to that marks a resolve to the natural way, giving our side of choice one other.
 </div>
 <div id="church">
    Because we are actionable, our regard for so, generally, draws us to ask - consider at least - the effect of those actions. Its understandable, simply, seeing as we evolved out of a primitive state, which was, to say, more dangergous and frugal, demanding thus, that we take more care and pay attention in what we do. Theology is this concern abreviated by the awareness one has of themsevles and the limit placed upon us. We know this introspectively, in some regard -moreso as we evolved, civally - but most notably, to do with our attention, is the passing of others, directly or as a tale passed on; in short, we know whats coming. Being somewhat able, though primitive, we asked the question about our deaths and there place: What would it be like? where do we go and, most importantly, are there reprecussion of what will happen that stem from our actions here, in life. This is Theology, our regard for judgement on our end and its relation to our state as beings ; we are looking for Benevolence because we are able to consider that some is possible at all ; "Its the idea of missing out, or being forever punished, that makes us frantic in our current state. Note, almost determinaly, that these concerns rest on those who, as if being able to see for the first time, are drawn to misery and fear over the notion of some possible sight; If they actually looked more carefully, they would realize that there was nothing short of the burning sun, the moon and its glowing way." It is our ignorance of what death actually means that bairs us down a strict path of greedy salvation, for we have given no moral concern. Equally then, we experience ignorant suffering, missing the unassuming life, that, riled with joy and flourishing, is scaffolded, strongly and just, with the understanding that our end is natural, to our ease in being blessed, tranquil in our memory, for we have seen the way. Nature has laid this road, we must bend our stake. Marrying her post so we can see her gain, happy and savouring, we know theres peace through the end, boistrous while were waiting

 <div id="monopoly">
    When we were boys, we knew the world by what we could see. There was no war or depravity, merely play, pleasure and fun. As we grew older though, duty was placed in front of us and we were asked to amend. When we didn't, there was conflict and trouble; when we did, however, we lost our way to what it was for. Life you see is short and seldom. Once we have this chance to appreciate and ascend to the world and her offer. "Our brief chance to be treated by the green in her way."
    <br>&emsp;How this contrasts with organized religion, is simply in what it is for. By our very nature, we are congenial to inquire. Without the results of previous investigation, the steps forward are stemmed from ignorance. This is the cause of religious proliferation. Because we have reached a point in which all we can see is thoroughly known, the supernatural bears no claim or fielty. The problem here is at the forefront. Tradition has developed from an adolescent stage, rooting herself in to become the norm. The prominence of this, by my diagnosis, has monopolized the ability to be devout in alternatively congregate ways.
    <br>&emsp;All of those who are in said way, happen upon it because of religion's lineage. Going back to a millennia, it is those who attempted to be congruent who hold this way, in being devoted, with disregard for nature and how she really is. The problem is clear, that this worship is based on a lack of reason, merited only in that it was what those(at the time) could come together about. It is because we form together on what is paramount, despite lacking any sufficient tools to do so, that's lead to any explanation being sound. Moreover, has this nature of ours to team up on what is important wounded the ability for current teams to be made. "The entire league is full of religion; but this was based on folly."
    <br>&emsp;Seeing as we are social creatures, my feeling is that our rational aspects should bear the grouping and helm of our time. If we are together, let it be for something that is truly good; this is how friendship through interest forms. We gather together based on similar values and attitudes of both bad and good: this is the root of congregation. My own resolve is to bare a credible and enriched claim, by the fruits of reason and her gain. By the natural principle, all exists in a shared way; if we task ourselves with bearings to this, then similar joys and kindness can be made, but from a sensible angle. "And seeing how our past has given us much salvation but wretched worldly affairs, I suspect that if we were otherwise wholly rational, then fully could we succeed at both."
    <div class="qu">Let there be goodness from reason so that all of our concerns will either be removed or dealt with. It is ill-founded not to have both</div>
    Quickly, I would like to give our goal some attention. I am a man, and this means a craft. We ardor away, with efficiency, so that we may groove and last. "This is our inherited way." Since civil dawn, we have been building and crafting, imparting ourselves for tribute and utility. As someone who is drowning throws their arms to issue a defense with all their strength and time, we, similarly, have built things that reflect a similar interest. Or rather we have made similar responses based on our own needs. Food, being essential, encourages us to be more able in how we gather and produce; furthermore, our communal setup suggests we find better ways to share and distribute; the success of that makes our proficiency opportune. The process of these advancements resulted in a stricter yet richer path, in which our nature was bent towards an industrious way. "The tools we've slated, the roof over our heads, these breakthroughs see our nature easily amended, for the result has been a simpler ask for us to groove into our environment. Consequently, this ingrained craftsmanship has seen our position become more positive, like a chair to sit in is quick to find comfort."
    <br>&emsp;This line seems to go back to our earliest days. To rubbing sticks together, to the creation of the wheel, since Erectus to Sapian, the world has continued to expand. I have some trouble though. For one thing, it is clear that cultural and mannered norms also develop as we establish ourselves throughout the environment. Similar to the base adage of 'specialization earned through agriculture', governance and society also develop, as if a crust to hold this new abundance. I cannot reconcile though the development and solidity of civilization, with the response through religion to ill-sifted impressions. Probably then, the question is about trying to define the link between industry and the furthered clarity of the world and what we see. It seems fair to suggest that complex things were at one point not exposed. Primitive life surely had no lens that even knew something so large and complex was occurring; yet at some point, we were able to see the magnanimity throughout our environment. Religion then seems to be the convention of our attempt to properly respond. The argument and explantion goes very simply. The initial attempts to satisfy what we regarded as 'God', were rooted(seemingly) in the infancy of our impression and ability to explain. As things became bigger, the more we were asked to make sense of the world, in this bolder sense. What is said by me, and most of those considered intelligent, is that this primitive stage bore the religious response.
    <br>&emsp;Through millions of years of evolution, we could finally and fully see. The fruit of that insight was not materialized with any accuracy though, and as if being able to see for the first time, our judgment was made outside of the rooted measure of things seen before. I would define our earliest religious attempts then, as one who earned a tool but, understandably, lacked the disposition from its use, to then see where it would proceed. "It is as if the phenomena came first and overwhelmed any ability to discern and measure." Looking back, it seems silly and easy for us living in the modern day, for all that is here is clear and known. Back then however, there would be nothing previously inquired. It would seem like a nightmare, which dwelled on one's mind and had little means to solve and remove. No wonder an answer was sought. I understand, like I said, the reason and motivation for things proceeding as they did, as it is clear(as they say), 'that a poor theory is more favorable than not having one'. I do not commend it though or invite a continuation.
    <br>&emsp;If our senses tell us that these beliefs and proclamations are folly, then we should not belittle them and have them thrown out. "For that is effectively what religions do to each other, and our own truths require no such course of action." Similar to those who have committed crimes, the following steps and action should be taken if some resolution is to be made. First off, and quickly till its met, is the removal of those who make others at risk for harm; when this is no longer a condition, then they shall proceed and join those in the second group, who are administered with the aim of rehabilitation. These people are equal to us, they just need to be trained. "Their goal is no different than those who are without infraction, they've merely slipped." Considering the suggestive nature of their predicament, relevant care should be and remain present; to what we all need though, they should be given, or at least moved, towards a position where they can make a viable and stable use of that.
    <br>&emsp;All of that being said, those in a religious position are not to be condemned nor left alone as is. They should be encouraged and shown, as we were as secularists. The more truth that we have gained, reveals the weeds of those whose claims are based on an ignorant tradition. The way to proceed is not by tyranny and despotic governance - for those would be similar in how they rule, only different in that their law stemmed from being secular. No, the means and answer to our problems and path is through a similar formation, like those religious, to what we find similarly important. Whereas those in the past gathered and indited based on the fear of that which imposed, our side of sensibility knows that truth found from reason, sets us all free indifferently. "This is why there are no pograms or crusades on the subject of Newtonian physics." From this, there is no reason to be afraid, and, thus, no purpose in persecuting or demanding obedience. "We who are with nature are already made; so we seek not, to either gain or deliver, rather our truth sets us evenly within ourselves." Seeing as this is ours, it is clearly one and for all. The gifts of science and philosophy are the tools for these extractions: they are in wide abundance though and require no tyranny to prevail, share or command. "The goods of art and industry are based on our generosity; moreso are the results self evident - and organized accordingly." We need only show then, rather than be given to or within a stance of delivery. Our truths are found by simply be people, and all that it means. Foremost then will our personal and corresponding congregational resolve, be based as if it were of religion or theology: it is merely full and round.

 <div id="extremes">
    At the height of organized society, Jesus Christ presented an insight into Man's core problem. Essentially, his concern was that material possession and a life devoid of God - the Christian at least- was prime for disarray and, at least, a thorn in our present scenario. This seems acceptable; the world had been progressing for many thousands of years and the interest and power of those in this material charge, were not directed at or aimed towards the appealment of the Gods, or at least avoided the scrutiny if it did it 'improperly'. Furthermore, it is regarded that 'Original Sin' foretold a return to a harmonious state with the lord, to which Jesus is credited as being the arrival - hence his death for our sins. The claim of this does have some merit in that it speaks to our arrogant way. Man is industrious, and can bend the environment with tools and construction to treat his own nature and claim. Doing so is not wrong, however, once this stability is set a problem becomes poignant: what is it for? It would seem that survival takes all precedence and that our ancestry is rooted in the continuation and success of that. It never had or was ever intended how things should be when that concern was no longer present. Generally, as it stands, either indulgence(by virtue of our free time) or respect for what comes far later(when our days on earth are no longer as free) is given the regard.
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps the extremes of both sides can give insight into the problem. On one hand, Utopian views of the world are present by the fantasy of even more proficiency. Considering our civilized success, inefficiencys and inequality show that the gains are not for all and, thus, better arrangements ought to be made. In that tyrannical regimes respond, who, based on this absolute ideal and notion, order themselves and command as to bring out this way. The issue here, that religion does address, is that however fortunate and well off we are, everyone still dies. The roots of what that mean may be traditional and primitive, but they do have a point. If we are to live, what is it for? It seems contrary that this should mean we forgo all the fruits of our living world, attesting to the unknown which follows. The point worth noting however, is that no matter the freedom within this current life, all of it gets flattened out by that coming end. "Where everyone has equal amounts of nothing." If this is true, or sound at least, the resolve towards it is in no way revealed by the heart of the matter. Only, it humbles us and keeps us centered and astute. "Being drunk and foolish fairs little as you reach death's door. And the point is that the former is not given outside the path to the latter." Although the details must be further understood, we could say that the point of Jesus, or the point towards sin in general, is that it does not bring one to that certain end, with any dignity lets say.
    <br>&emsp;With regard to religion though, their absolute claim is based on the agreement and dedication of effort and intentions when it comes to God. This comes from a branch of truth, but, it is addressed and ill-comprehended in a way that its merits can make. Religion bases itself on the misapprehension of the creator's claim. We see it as the cause of things in our environment, but further that to be the holder of an existence after death. Our mortality being our sophisticated stake, sees the primitive roots of it develop alongside the earlier notions of a higher power, who, seeing as he is and does all, has a similar grip on death and its gain. This is why there is a trunk of discontent and disregard for our time as living. The complex nature of religion has become a total regard for the thing which bars importance: our death. Since, in their view, this condition is only met by treating the lord properly and well, the very essence and care for our time as living things bear no interest or claim. "As they say, it is not what being is for." On that note we can better understand the theological claim of sin, which is clear in what addresses it and which runs contrary to it. If our view of that end is different than those of the traditional kind, we can at least attest to their being one at all. "Even if we see it as simply natural." In that case, being gluttonous and vain supports no path toward its finish. Which one though is true and what elements are appropriate as a response, this is not wholly clear. The point, is that although our sins may be accurately reflected in our reckless ways, there is no contrasting approach or ideal which has given alternative truth. "For in that case, the good was similarly ill-founded."
    <br>&emsp;Contrasting the two, Material Utopias have absolute aims in the groundwork of governance and technology; religion, instead, bears admission of a higher power and its hold on eternity: that is its absolute claim. The truth in suggesting that there is Original Sin has strength in the disregard for the meaning in our lives. Without respect to our mortality, we will not live well; our innate fear only encourages further stability, of which none can prevail. "The cliff runs over for dirt and Queens." This fear however, is ignored and irrelevant to our animal ways, from the accumulation of our success in the environment. Even though we have done so substantially, our life still has very little claim. It is this more innate acceptance that religion centers on. The religious feeling is prior to the organization of those motivated by remission from their deaths. Initially, it was just an overwhelming response. The development though, of what we concluded there to be, became the spot where our deepest issue could be placed: our deaths. In that, we were honest. We admitted - however erroneously - to our real fear. By addressing that, we were at least trying to live the best of our lives. The issue with religion, as it developed, is in similar ways to the flattening of Utopias. In each case, the aim is based on the perfection of means; religion's err, in that case, stems from the precedent of life after death, besides our actually being as the claim; equally, communism and fascism seek similar precedents in their way, differing though in that it is for our being in life. It fails in the same way though, as it ignores and colludes our actual joy and stake.
    <br>&emsp;These admissions of survival and death are equal in what they require. Their acceptance and regard is paramount if we are to prevail and taste the treat of life's joys and her offer. That is our stake, in living. It is only so that it would be our claim, for it was sought and made deliberately so. It is in that decisive decision that reveals the fork in the road: As creatures who can administer being as the aim, consideration and strength in their assessment and address- through the mind that can - paves the way for our claim to take. It is only in being ourselves that we can truly be, for, equally, it'd mean a sound expression. It is from that toil though, that we should make for, as it is what marbles the way. Through reason and inquiry, we demonstrate ourselves as one who can confess and address that living well is the way to be. Using those tools however is the proper way, in that, we must respect our living and death so that we can flourish and be. "Ought we do this properly as to avoid those extremes?"

    As I know more I will begin, that relgion is primarily a fellowship of interest, devout and in unison towards the praise and wares of God. There is not truth in anything thats said, but, most notably, it is clear and evident that this very tendency to congregate - and in turn share how were are devout - suggests the nature of fully aware humans; moreso as we go, it seems obvious that the very development of our ability to more fully impress, correlates with an arrangment towards that ' whollyness', as if it were divine. It is as if we are more aware that the floods have occured and damaged our livelihood; it seems to me that our spiritual devotion comes from the very concern of what is most important; what is worth noting though, is that it is exactly the means in which we realize things to be important, that cause use to bear our stake to that which seemingly proports it: It is faully then, considering how little, in those early moments at least, that we'd understand. Since Science and rational 'Maturity'(as I'll call it) has taken place, our clarity of why these things that matter occur. The difference though, is that despite the irrational goal of appeasing a concieved propagotor, of such calamites, we, in the present, still have not developed our own personal goal. Whereas those in relgion mobilized to pray and offer themselves for the sake of the plague and its remission, we humans now, however developed, merely have an understanding that these occurences are pure and natural- despite the misfortune - : We only know this through sound tools of measurment; we still care little, and act as such, as to how and why we conduct our lives.
    <br>&emsp;On to Divnity then: This is best described as the actions of what is supernatural. Ignoring pantheistic inadeqacy- of our explanation - things that occur outside of the natural order, are defined as being 'Supernatural'. Attributed by us, these actions are induced by a being, referred to as a deity, or a God; monotheistically, meaning, in your regard at least, their is only one defining spirit, will see you refer to that essence strictly as God; contrasting here with one, as in 'a', of many, sees the difference. By definition, it seems the very presence of the divine, suggests that the natural world is not fundemental, or at least primary and isolated, for the spirit - so to speak - in both way permeates and transcends the material world, existing throughout and above. In more common terms though, we can consider that, despite existing outside of this normal realm, there is still a 'nature' - so to speak - of this deity or God. In other words, what we described as a deity, the Divine, or God, is the qualities and attributes that we see as being supernatural: Those being, notablly, omnipotent power, full presence and awareness, total knowledge and subsequene, to name a key few. Where the consideration of this hits a fork, is simply the fact that, at least when it comes to formal regard, our reasoning for what a God is, differs from what religion infers. Whereas we, as intellectuals, see God, by definiition, as being prone to and in command of these aspects - that make the entity god like- , religion sees aspects(notably) of desing, benevolence and Grace. There impression is not from a sound and thorough source, as if they considered what a God would have in order to be, then saw those qualities through some impression. Instead, their 'fuzziness' in prayer and respect, bends together with the hope and promise that supernatural powers our present when it comes to us. In that case, it is not complete power that we - the religion - regard, but rather that all powerful beings interest and charity to us. It is clear, moreso, to the description of this, that our fear and expectations, is that our actions motivate such deity to respond in a certain way; it seems then that misfortune came before reason was produced; thus, attribution and custom were developed, as we tried to understand the casue of calamity, and, in such, treated it as though it were a punishment: Proper dealings with and praise became cultured norms, as to avoid future suffering.

    Theologically, the concept of divine intervention is tricky. Foremost is that each member of the whole seems to bounce off and reflect their positions relative to the others; introducing new ones then seems incompatible as the entire system would have to account for it: this is based on the premise that the system on any given day, already accounts for entirety and its constituents. I cannot vouch for whether this premise is sound though -it is merely placed as a point of clarity and position.
    <br>&emsp;I think a local example would do us more service. Disregarding the factual attempt or even the historical account, I question whether the holes in Jesus’ hands upon resurrection were repaired or left the same. In addition, I offer the point that he is still a man regardless of his inhabitance by God, and therefor ought to be supposed to respirate, among the other accompanying physiological systems. The question I would raise on this account is with respect to the reinstatement of oxygen into the lungs and depletion of carbon dioxide -by virtue of the fact that they were either both absent, or that the lungs were flat in general, and by the dynamics of gas pressure, could not suddenly again take in 02. “Less these elements were unnaturally introduced, how could the process proceed?” Perhaps the argument is that there was no following need to breathe. But my feeling then is that resurrection on this basis is incompatible with any physiological concern.
    <br>&emsp;Now, I understand that he is the son of God, and the natural rules that everything else obeys is not so relevant, especially considering the adjustments made by the holy hand. But if such an embodiment was done onto an orange, we would still say this is citrus; and if the spirit landed in honey, it would be strange if we found it unsweet. “For what would it even be then, despite the host?” And the point, is that be it of a plain man or one housed by God himself, are the workings of man -or at least his parts common to the rest- not likely and at any rate guaranteed to be present? Again, who is the son of God being when he housed within a body, which we’d compare to man, but lacks any need to breathe? More than that, how does he have a metabolism and thus any means to use his muscles, or have a heart beat? “I am surprised he could even stand.” Perhaps, the missing pieces, or their intended products, were merely introduced. The crux of our concern though, is if something can only be due to intervention, or unnatural and non-concurrent means that is, then the contrariety of this must be accounted for amidst all other ordinary acting things; or, more importantly, if the actions of everything around did not show any signs of responding as though their course was deemed contrary -via that moment of intervention- then we may rightly suspect that such a disruption did not occur. 
    <br>&emsp;At this point, we are not making the claim that nature was or was not suspended, merely resting on the fact that if it was, that all other things around would show signs that it had. And as it were, things appear to be going as if nothing abruptly happened. To be clear, the notion of ‘the first cause’ is not what we’re referring to, for even that may have been God’s generous command. Only, in that case it would be initial, whereas of all things that have so far come, none appear to be shifted around by any event besides that. “Which is to say, nothing so far has in between, intervened.” And such a fact, however concurrent with the records of nature, runs with much contrariety to that of man.
    <div class="qu">As they say though, struggle is God’s way of challenging us in order to make us stronger:  the acceptance of truth which, and honest admission to it, is the hallmark of that</div>
    God, I presume, does not pull the bottom rung lightly from his house of cards. Nor do I suppose (or suspect) that his ability to do so is very possible, or, moreso, of interest to him. What I take to be true is that he does not contradict himself in any given way, and that to resurrect someone would place such tension between what he otherwise ordained; or at least, doing so (among other interventions) would cause the rest of nature to blunder in response. The notion may be ‘how is it that he resurrected Jesus then?’. Perhaps, as well, his physiological concern was not depleted upon Christ’s revival! “Because he willed, of course!” The logical error here is assuming that because our belief is that this event happened, our understanding of God’s will must fall in line with what we feel to be true. What if we’re wrong though? God may not actually intend to tear physiology out of its common mold, for he may know and therefore rest on the fact that it would in fact be contradictory. He could not resurrect Jesus since the CO2 would have depleted in his lunges, and he’d therefore not be able to re-intake oxygen: or are those who believe otherwise suggesting that Jesus had no need to breathe? 
    <div class="qu">Why do we revere God for all his fine-tuning, but carry ourselves forward as though the arrangement can willy-nilly change? I just don’t get it</div>
    My suspicion, in closing, is that our request of the world to form our opinions and thinking, is too heavily sifted from our point of view, rather than what truly composes the world, and its according offer. This may account for the anthropomorphization born through our grand impressions, and their place being based on an ordering what it is we feel and see to be true. Is the quest of philosophy then -and the equal aim of  science- not to suggest that our vision is off, and then better reroute? 
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps the events we do see are worth respecting, even though they were identified without a strong lens (or scrupulous sense); which, in a way, leaves us with an image without color. For the most part though, this may be fine, and for a millennia served us, in both reassurance and unity. Think of the plagues though which were due to a lack of infrastructure (and blamed otherwise), or the pograms which were conducted under the charge of heresy. Are these really sound? Is the truth being amended to properly here, or being discerned well at any rate? Could that image simply be wrong?  ”As the world seems quite thin in its nature and ways without much color, as there is not much depth.”“Is that saturated portrait not the one that better depicts the place in which we exist? Why bear a truth that was rooted in our imagination?”
    <div class="qu">The struggle for the modern man it seems, is to have more value and integrity than those outside religion, who may in fact lack any driving force and according principle, but do so with respect to a truth which was founded on something more than beliefs, testimony, fables or submission</div>

 <div id="anendtobegin">
    I like the idea that our aim is happy to be reached in both abundant and appropriate ways. You may find that one side is constricted for the benefit of the other, but I see no need. 
    <br>&emsp;Let’s bring this together with our true mold. We will die surely, but this simply means that our soul will be resting rather than living: the being remains. The principal then, is that we should enter this state with openness and acceptance. From a place of living our being of rest ought not be remissed or sought otherwise: for we stiffen up and, by virtue of the point and the moral of the proposal, that your rest then is tampered -and that being forever means that you are in some way eternally at unease.
    <br>&emsp;What does this mean then? Well, from our being forthright we can see this is coming. Perhaps it is because we recognize our state of activity and are supposing that rest is equally a state, of which our eternal death will be; therein we are becoming inclined to see our living actions as prior to those of our resting state. The central point is that our being remains. If we wish for the tranquil state of it to be properly so, then the steps prior must be proficient within the state of their kind. “Put another way, only if our living state is consistent and true, will the resting state that follows have an equal harmony.” The mark of this being in error is when we tense up and grieve on death’s door -where living appears the only claim, and rest is consequently resisted. How we know that we are living well then is that when it is done, the underlying soul continues into the proceeding rest untarnished, then able to be in that way, fully and truly. 
    <br>&emsp;The question then is what sort of soul do we want during living? There are two things we know. First, we want to be light at the end of it within that state, and that whichever it ought to be during living is what ‘that living and corresponding activity’ is good to give. That latter point is what we must discuss, for it is essentially the heart of our question: what constitutes proper living? Again, it is that which results in a proper soul. To reiterate, that soul which is proper upon death is light rather than stiff -so we may enter rest with tranquility instead of being torn and displeased. “Taking the point to be true that accepting our death for the sake of ease and willingness so that our resting state can be evenly lasting, holds the bearing for what the active states before this are requested to be.”  But, I must admit, that besides our qualification that what is good is so, that a breezy transition occurs, and how this is quite sound, affords me no obvious sight as to what things fit such groove. “In that, my understanding of Man and his ends, is not so comparable to what’s known in his active ways: at least what they should be for the sake of the former.”
    <br>&emsp;What strikes me is this issue, where we assume that the final step before death, when we are in fact still living (by virtue of it being before), is not appropriately considered as part of the steps prior. “It is as if we took the principle to be true, but therein asked how we should be upon maturing to a point where it would then need to be more actively prepared for and addressed.”  As Socrates or Epictetus would say, as Seneca and Marcus remark along with revering those prior who felt the same, to even Montaigne like a modern of old, ‘that this is what you were born to do, and are as a consequence marked in both the destination of it and thus requirement to forever prepare.’ And to those who do, when the deed by tyrants or age is done, they offer themselves knowing there is rest: for their sight and mind is clear, able to anticipate and in finality see it. To that they are truly done. And despite being unsure, the steps prior are at least so that they beckoned, or at least gave respect, to the notice which their regards gave them: that an end is in fact coming. 
    <div class="qu">And perhaps our course, be it in frivolity or sincerity, is to simply keep that in mind</div>
 </div>
 <div id="deartestament">
    So a friend asked me how I know what is right and wrong. I said that God tells me; he then wished me to clarify how I knew that was true: I made a faith filled argument. Now, that is fine, be it of tradition or a baser meaning of faith -rather a literal meaning of it. My interest though is in establishing a position that is based on strength. If you take the former position that is based on faith then it would reasonable to suppose that no merit or basis for amending to it was present, but you believed no less. A rational argument, or one that is bound from thoughtfulness, deliberation and care, may have all the merit in the world yet still lie short. In this case some faith would be required for a certain claim.
    <br>&emsp;Let me put forth an example. The sun goes around the earth from our point of view: will it do so tomorrow? On one end you could say that considering the thinness of your understanding of how it acted as it did already, then you could say that a laudable prediction of how it will act ahead is equally small; however, you could address the fact that accounts of it orbiting trace back nearly thousands of years; moreso could you reference the aging of a tree and the many years it takes to reach maturity, respecting the fact that the Sun seems ever more grander, and this gives some suggestion that it will continue longer than that. The point being then, that although I don’t know how long it will proceed, the scope of what its limit is seems at least bound within a duration longer than, say, a week. In that case, less we were on the edge of its iterations, I am confident that it will rise tomorrow and similarly the following day. Let us come at this from a faith based point of view. When asked if it will rise tomorrow, the person in that view simply says it will; seeing as I spent a fair amount of time trying to explain my own side, I asked them to offer a detail or two as to why they were confident themselves; they, in short, had faith that it would and believed in it therefore. See the difference?
    <br>&emsp;One concern that strikes me from this inquiry is that those of us interested in establishing truth from an inquisitive ground will surely fall short of those whose positions are immediately baked and completed from their place of faith. And it is a mighty difficulty to decipher the value in being less sure, however rational, compared to being so sure, despite being baseless when it comes to observations and understanding. One idea that comes to mind is that those within faith take certain things to be fundamentally true, which in effect encourages their confidence in other possible happenings. A criticism I’d offer is regarding the merit of faith besides a theistic reality. In other words, if the workings and results of the world were in fact natural and relational, as opposed to being willfully suspended, then the faith one had would merely serve as stoutness in the face of unknown effects. “You can see how the removal of intervention spoils the expectations of the faithful as the consequence they face will result from the constant orderings of the world -rather than being controlled benevolently.” At this point faith seems more akin to stoic behavior. “I know not what will happen but have faith that no matter the end I’ll be ok.” Let’s take these terms to be synonymous and fair. The ostensible meaning of faith is that one believes that good things will happen to them due to God’s intervention-whom they have faith will be generous. The issue with this is that the complete idea of God rests on a pantheistic point of view; herein, he is not or cannot be contrary to himself; as it seems from our tactile understanding of what it is he offers, suggests that the intricacies of his being cannot be fiddled with or tampered with. “Unless we think he would or could pull out the keystone card underneath, assuming he was the rest of the deck at least.”
    <br>&emsp;My aim here is not to dispense with theistic faith; rather, I am trying to discern the value in learning the truth in a contrasting way. One of the troubles though is that in seeing the limits of that direction, I am left refuting the alternative option as invalid; perhaps I am doing this on the basis of those rational limits, only that I see them as the only option(and essential in that case). This will explain what I see. If the primary position is one based on inquiry, and this format is limited to strength rather than certainty, then what is the resolve we can make or understanding that we can have that this approach is absolutely true? In this respect, I can offer the world a point of view that is smelted through strength. It can break and will through ignorance or time brittle away, but it is a sword to be used and that is what we need. Moreover, does the faith which we otherwise have, reveal the necessities which we ultimately seek; and I cannot offer an alternative solution that meets those standards. I can however offer a proposal that is rooted in rationality, regarding the issue which that need for absolute guarantees requests. In that case I’d suppose that those amending themselves to something absolute, in both resolve and respect, are simply wishing to achieve salvation. My feeling though is that there is no need to worry about the concerns this issue is rooted in. Foremost do I see it as a result of storytelling, their developments, gregarian strictness and the orthodoxy produced through that and so forth. At this point, I fear the greatest of dialectics. This is not the final issue though, rather I am merely narrow in my ability to determine strength. “The point of reason is not to better know the world so that a more accurate guarantee can be made.” Rather, supposing that we did know more would surely reveal to us how much more there was left; in that case our own limits seem appropriate. And in that case, considering what knowledge we do have and our humble assessment of how much accuracy there is within that, allows us to make a response to the world as our rational, industrious, empirical, thoughtful, inquisitive, gentle, mature, gregarious, humble, liberal, reflective, prospective, sensible and attuned faculties revealed to us to be.
    <br>&emsp;Why is faith wrong though? If it is addressing a higher truth then no wonder it can’t be seen or amended through rationality and minded discernment. To me this is the critical point. That point which we conceive of as absolute and inaccessible to experiment and doubts, in principle, runs forever. “It is not the case that it is some foreign country whose borders we know yet prevents our access to it. Rather it is a land that is imagined to be far from reasons delight and observation.” This is perhaps true. To us though can our amendment to it then be only so from a metaphysical level: it simply cannot be anything more.
    <br>&emsp;It is ludicrous to propose that faith is the only present and active faculty or behavior within the heart and soul of man. The goal of this inquiry is in many ways trying to discern the value of each. In that case, those of us who wish to suspend their need for rational judgment and tend to their faith instead, O.K. We must still recognize what the faith is besides, and therefor the entity which each is in. I draw this point based on the construction one has of that absolute realm, or idea at least. Faith as we are mentioning refers to the trust one has, that it’s either there, or in addition caring. Let’s put divine intervention and its revelations aside. This argument rests on a level wherein nothing was known except that which was around us. We’re on a planet, there is a sun, we can think and consider, of ends and what it needs, wherein faith or reason is applied. I say this, with the assumption that the players and field are the same, under the notion that ‘the absolute’ is a metaphysical and unobservable proposition, whereas the natural world and our place within it from a living to restfull state is the rational position. The question then is which side do we assent to; one which is higher but requires us to trust in it for we cannot know, or that which is approached through strength and uncertainty? Personally, I cannot know in either case; one however encourages my strength whilst the other is so high that faith must be employed to believe in it.
    <br>&emsp;It is worthwhile to mention that sentiment of taking things to be true based on prior conclusions; this, for example, reflects a Christian sentiment that is taken to be true under the agreement of past writings and happenings -biblically or in testimony that is. Now, I would apply this onto the metaphysical assumptions one might make in their depiction of that absolute image. For one, has nothing ever been the totality, or has something always been( in its fundamental form); secondly, does your motivation for employing your faith and its basis on the ‘design and charity’ of reality have any real merit? For one, as they say, why would the introduction of things explicitly mean a choice was made; moreover, does a choice being made make any equal sort of strict notion that the way things are(and are advancing) can be tempered with; as well, seeing as we have a host of those other faculties, why should we assume that our faith onto the creator is more paramount rather than involving those things? Similar to a rock eroding or a star exploding, what suggests that our own death isn’t issued with equal justice and natural necessity?
    <br>&emsp;This brings up the most important point: why are we afraid of dying? First, I am not referring to one’s natural fear and retreat from death; rather, I am focusing on one’s anticipations of heaven or the fear of hell. Initially, it is unclear why either of these are deemed to be true; I suspect it is from stories being turned into fables, which in turn are taken to be genuine sources and bases for knowledge. Religious texts generally have this problem, such as ‘lying is a terrible thing as is theft and perjury: it is so bad, you’d be better off dead’. The point of this is not to fear punishment for these things or that a reverent oblige to commit repentance is necessary if guilty; rather it is a figure of speech that is utilized to emphasize the civil plea to avoid these wrongdoings. Perhaps the positions of our argument are thus revealed. For one, it is said don’t steal, and I may say on one end that you should not because ‘it’ is simply wrong; the alternative side seeks to give a better reason why. The issue though is that the latter bases itself on reference and its basis on pastoral or messianic authority; the former on the other hand seeks to study sociology, economics, politics, psychology etc., and attempts to offer reasons not to perform such acts. This argument is generally placed within the notion ‘there are reasons not to do so for the sake of human survival and prospering’. If you have prior assumptions of rules that rest above this then a position will alternatively be taken there; or at least, a mention will be said why those reasons and factors are ultimately true. That we would know what that highest determinant is with any certainty suggests ill caution; having faith that it is there then is one thing, but defining it is limiting -which is why we must have faith, for we do not know. I will only make one note in this entire book. And that is the fact that in writing technically from a personal point of view, or rather with my feelings besides the lecturing point, offers the least clarity. “And so I hope that the specific elements within, make the whole worthwhile to have produced -even though in total, it is uniquely burgamesh.”
 </div>
 <div id="roomfordoubt">
    Faith marks the fact that we do not know but have trust anyways. What I suspect though is that we are in fact taking things to be true that give our further ideas some credibility. “It’s as if we cannot strictly prove God’s existence or that he is benevolent but see it as genuinely true, but needing faith to fully understand it and thus anticipate the results.” This is a mighty issue for those with these feelings. You simply cannot have your cake and eat it too. How can past knowledge and or experience stand as laudable pillars for your current regard? Your beliefs as they are cannot be of the absolute and grace if there is anything more than faith to get you there. Now, you may act rational and speculative, slightly at least, otherwise your place in the discussion is hypocritical -to take our side of things completely for granted! Stand where you are and abide by the faculties you emphatically choose; I don’t agree with the ignorance of those others but I especially disdain their presumptuous use.
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps this is too tall an order for some. One reason is that in order to have faith in some thing, it must be defined, pictured at least; these illustrations, be it from the divine or not, are of those more sensible and vigorous faculties. That is why I say that your metaphysical view is still subject to reason, for it is an idea based on one. My simple argument against assumptive faith is that the roots and development of it have come out of centuries of anecdotes, gregarian experiences, theistic and hopeful impulses, and in short the groundwork from this that explicitly followed. In other words, our current feelings about the world may in fact seem true despite needing faith in order to attest to the scope of it; however, this position as I’d claim, is still based on premises that are inherently taken to be true. On one end is the assumption of what God is and the necessary congruence towards him; this has been established and culturalized since the writings of the Old and New Testament. That word, testament, is perhaps the kink in faith’s armor. “We take God to be true not because of what others have heard and seen, rather we grant his existence out of faith and explain it through those testaments. The rational man would look at the testaments, see their worth, then add them towards his conclusion.” This you may say is the princiiple of lineage; it describes our state as being one that has been arrived at from the past, and incorporating its steps. I believe that if you look at the development of early man and his transition into organized society, the emergence of formal religion can be reasonably explained; moreso, if you can explain the ways in which ideas and accounts develop beyond their initial fact or intention, then you can see how the premises we take to be true are lavishly false. “What I wish for from someone in this case, is to either act and say, or do so in private, in a way reminiscent of ‘I have no reason to believe this, I’ve given it none and care for no thought: I take it to be true on faith though, no matter if the idea I have of it is unbound through the medium of thinking. My decision is made, my mind’s unnecessary.” The point to be clear is that the grand object which you have your faith towards was constructed using the very faculties which you ignore in resolving yourself to it. “I thought of God and knew him not true; when I stopped questioning it though and just saw him, then to what was seen I believed in -despite any lacking evidence.”
    <br>&emsp;Let’s see if we can be brief and final. We may suppose that there are other things beyond the observations available to us; moreso then, would the continuity and integrity of what we have so far seen wain. I am unsure whether or not this is likely or true. However, when I remove myself from the equation, our position seems ample. Primarily, when the innate issues that fundamentally challenge me come up, our oblige seems sufficient. This, I believe, is the sole determining factor of what makes someone the person they are. If the request is that you die, and that you do so well, then being able to parse this and humbly resolve will see your response as sufficient. In a similar way, if growing muscles demands working out, then the required effort and discipline will seem acceptable: for our understanding of what’s necessary renders the action as just, appropriate, meaningful and warranted. In that case, our death seems to naturally follow our living. Upon reflection, our time within sleep and rest compares to the nothing which our death will be; more or less will our acceptance of this ground our prior living into an obliged state with respect to the dream that follows. In that, the course is fair and opportune -for living within the state prior to rest, bears the corresponding joys of activity as your claim.
 </div>
 <div id="delta">
    What I think religious people do is extend the width of their ball into all of entirety. The reasons why are not so explicit, but comparing the alternative limit is otherwise warranted. What it comes down to is a state of permanence. Those in that former camp wish to live and rest in the halls of God; and they think that by aligning themselves to his will, that their own essence will be plastered in his realm of existence. "I say with even the most minor of assurances, that there is grave weakness in this claim; for it in many ways runs contrary to what He himself intended, or that you otherwise could if it were what he even wished." Perhaps that is why he arranged us the way that he does, as he could not give us the life of him. "And God seldom runs contrary."
    <br>&emsp;The point then, is that if we cannot reach this permanent state, then an impermanent one is what we are more clearly ordained to and thus right to achieve. This way has many woes however, as living in a small space can be cumbersome. However, we must be distinct when we regard our local pursuits of reasoning upon the whole of the world, as one which is merely illustrative, rather than an objective itself. "For even if we could see the lands and will of God, are we divine?" It seems that our wish to do so is a result of our otherwise encumbrance, yet Buddha's belief that this only arises through ignorance suggests that our righteous place is not in abandoning those lands which we are clueless in. Instead of painting an absolute picture, let us merely draw one which has an all encompassing depth: but remains from our point of view. This has much ontological reasoning behind it, as well as ones of effective theology and sense; but nevertheless, we can say that our place within this domestic state is ultimately an impermanent one. "Thus we must arrange ourselves to be in accordance with that, rather than extending ourselves for the sake of what such a habitation would provide."
    <br>&emsp;Put another way, the higher claims of permanence do not make it more just, nor do the limited gains from impermanence not remove its value. "For we ought only do better, whereby the removal of ignorance that would let us do so, would in itself show us and instate a reward worthwhile and appropriate."

 <div id="buddha">
    Let's give a brief overview of Buddhism, then we'll get specific. Founded by Siddhartha Gautam, Buddhism was a Sramana movement that found its developments during the second urbanization of Iron age India. During this time the Upanishads of the Vedic religions were being developed as well as the world becoming generally more urban and mercantile. The core of its practice(being sramanic) was one rooted in personal toil, exertion, devotion and austerity. Compared to the Brahamic religions (namely Hinduism), Buddhism was more of a philosophical movement. Jainism and Ajivika are its contemporaries in that regard. Within Buddhism there are two primary paths -to liberation, or Marga(as it's called). One, is the Theravada school which emphasizes one's attainment of nirvana(or extinguishing); its aim is in ending the cycle of death and rebirth(samsara). Secondly, there is the Mahayana school which aims at becoming a bodhisattva, as to benefit all sentient beings -through bodhicitta. Theravada(the school of Elders) is more prevalent today in southern Asia -including Sri Lanka and the countries near Burma- whereas Mahayana(Great Vehicle) is more prominent in northern Asia -including Japan(in the form of zen), China, Taiwan, Korea and Nepal.
    <br>&emsp;The general objective of a Buddhist is to achieve liberation from anitya(impermanence), dukha(dissatisfaction or suffering) and anatman(absence of lasting essence). What is to be avoided is samsara, or the cycle of rebirth; this is caused by craving things and being attacked -this is dukkha. Those aversions from prior are the result of this. This notion marks the first of the four truths given by Buddha -and as recorded in the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta upon his first sermon regarding these. The second of these truths is samudaya, which emphasizes what comes from these cravings; in other words, the dukkha brings on samudaya, and saturates one with suffering(and the placement within samsara). To combat this, Nirodha marks the cessation and suppression of those cravings, or dukkha, and in turn the samudaya that follows. Additionally, we can say that the clinging from dukkha creates karma 'as if you are digging yourself into a hole and likely more troubled to get out of it'; consequently, by removing the hole, or karma that is by ceasing the additions to it -and assuming the skhandas(or baggage) that were there swell down- leads one to a point where there is no more craving: this is Nirvana. Then, upon death, parinirvana is obtained as the transfer from living to death is achieved without rebirth. "In a way, the hungers of our minds heat it up, and in effect lead us to a point where inflammation occurs; moreso, are we without the graces of goods and impressions that come into our cooled mind. For these are the elements which don't stick onto us as we are not aligned with them. In that we are without self and empty, only experience." The fourth truth refers to the path to achieve this enlightenment. Called magga, or the middle way, this route is one based in the Noble Eightfold path, where right characteristics are aimed at being demonstrated, the result being the removal of samudaya(thirst) and its root cause(dukkha) by the way of Nirodha(cessation). If successful, Nirvana will be reached and the flame of suffering will be quenched; in turn, a quiet freedom and peaceful happiness will come through -this being Moksha(or Vimukti). Having achieved this freedom, one is considered a Bodhi.
    <br>&emsp;With that overview in mind, we can briefly reflect on what we further seek. For example, Mahapanna marks 'Great Wisdom' and is just one of many ethics and or qualities in Buddhist Sanskrit. This seems remarkably appealing to discover. "Great Compassion(as Maha-karuna) is another example." As it stands, the historical aspect of Buddhism seems less pressing; that is, the texts, origins of Buddha himself and his lineage of teachings and schools: the actual tenants and philosophy feel more important. We can admittedly find admiration and insight from how he lived, but the scholarly roots of the schools and text feel like precision works, whereas our effort now is probably best spent into the core pillars of the overall model -as opposed to chartering when, where, from whom and how it was built. "Show me the David and I will confess interest towards Michaelangelo." Building on that, would our focused study of India and its political history give us the relevant context and means for seeing Buddhism's uprising -when we reached the Mahajampas. Second then, is the practice of Buddhism. This is similar in terms of those foremost ideals, but the emphasis here is on the practice of reaching them(through meditation and reflection etc.) as well as its social nature(in Sanghas). This is fairly personal to me, as at least one thread within the heart of my aim regarding these religious studies, is to see how others conducted themselves personally and with others. "I will be accomplished if I learn, am inspired or simply see the self respect from another being devout, in communion with others who are comparably ordained. This is enough from Buddhism, Christians, and or reason itself." Lastly, are the inquisitive aspects of Eastern thought. Buddhism holds a great deal here, but ideas are what I am seeking and so Hinduism and other schools are equally welcomed. In this case, the Brahman, Dharma, soteriology, ontology, eschatology, intervention, absence, ostensibly etc., are all bursting with opportunities to gain insight and utility towards our own English affairs. Rounding out the heart of Buddhism though feels most appropriate; and hopefully in that case we can give our thought to what it and its elements effectively reflect.
    <div class="qu">One current suspicion, is that the idea of Karma simply addresses the conjuring of our natures as we learn more, and how in vying for things outside it, as if the whinning kid now had a gun, makes us foolish and vain. Karma remarks that ridding ourselves of these ignorant impulses will leave us free and empty. What I would say, is that we merely need a better stake, as if we were producing fairly conceived thoughts that reflected the good in the world as one who is sound and grateful sees it. The Buddhist way though does seem to address the limits of our nature forming from nothing, intellectually that is: for we always come short. My belief though is that the issue is not the approach, rather the awareness that you are in one. And in being so inclined, can the good that we seek become staked on what is congenial to the reason we've acquired, as opposed to making for innate ends by these stronger means</div>
 </div>
 <div id="brahma">
    Buddhism in fact contrasts with Vedic beliefs that there is an all encompassing god. In that later case there is Brahma, while in Buddhism there is Pratityasamutpada, which etymologically combines one's insight and belief in the truth of something, and in this case onto the causality by which things rise and cease. Dharma then to the Buddhist is a means to alignment with this flow of things 'as to cross the river', then let the raft go. The key difference between Buddhism and Hinduism is that the latter believes in a higher working principle(Brahman and Rta) which upon adherence(or dharma) fills one up, as if there is a link between existence and man(atman); on the other hand Buddhism believes in a non self, that is one that is unattached (anatma) and able to proceed without clingings or cravings. Instead, their view is that things happen by cause and effect rather than an intelligent governor. The point about Pratityasamutpada then is that because the Buddhist aim is not to 'cross the river and hold the boat', they need only see how things effectively are within some relation to themselves; their action then that corresponds to that, in contrast to a lasting position amongst the whole of things, results in a dharmic harmony of release and impermanence(nirvana).
    <br>&emsp;Vedic ontology and theology does carry ideas itself, but they are merely unfounded if joy is our aim. Simply, if one's wishes to appease God, they never will; though the idea that there is something high and absolute gives less demand that someone use their deliberate attention as in the Buddhist case. The latter will never feel full and completed, only that they are at best in a gentle state(nirvana) before their lasting end(parinirvana), while the former will feel complete and one, permanently mind you, yet at the mercy of their natural impermanence. "For Buddhism, one can simply recede from life's longing and reach an experience of Moksha and ending parinirvana. The one who otherwise believes in and resolves themselves to the highest principle(Brahman) will only do so prominently; this is not a poor thing to understand, only if the depiction of these higher orders are illustrated as being governed by supreme benevolent beings and creators, then the attempt of reconciliation will be one where absence is not merely an aversion, but fear, as the answer to the deities call is forgone; moreso then, does the harmony with Brahma leave one without the goods of Dharma in any kind, as their plea was not to experience wellness and joy, but remission from sin."
    <br>&emsp;Admittedly, the aims of nirvana and Brahmic alignment are two sides of the same coin. Their slight contrast though marks a more significant difference between religions and other philosophies in general. Effectively, our happiness can be larger if it is from a higher being, yet what occurs is that we ingratiate the form of it with something which explains it. "It's as if we must depict a god or creator to imagine the workings of nature beyond ourselves." These portrayals though are not the positive means that we seek, for they corrupt us with fear of things based on a watching eye, rather than what is good in itself. Put another way, it seems that a more local awareness of how things are as they pertain with you is a more practical and sensible mold to align oneself with; while the former approach is eventually made up, this latter merely aligns to nature as it directly pertains to us. "Ought we not take the bagel because it is poor and unduly sought for, compared to ignoring its use and error by our intent to some other divine harmony."
    <br>&emsp;The key thing, is that a Brahmic resolve is one where reality is infinite and eternal, and that being in line with that would bring us the most, while being one with the simple passings of our day seems comparatively small. The thing, is that our divine illustration is the only thing which can describe what that higher order is and what it requires. These depictions are in effect untrue, and thus eventually poor in what they provide. "For the actions in our life as people are what give us good and bad, as crime is good to be absent from as is friendship great to be in the presence of; we may in fact be satisfied and attuned to the molds of God's will, but ways of our actual nature are not addressed. For we must eat, we must run, were better to think and be good with relations built from this; these things take that passive time and care to amend to and cultivate: and religious folk simply don't prioritize that -for that aim rather, as they appease more than recieve."
    <br>&emsp;The key point is not that a Buddhist cant have a large view of the world; Buddhist theology generally does. These are scaffoldings though, climates around our local matters which serve as a cloudy border by which the whole of our regard operates; it always comes back to us though, and how our mind can become nirvanic, rather than attached. And those of religion paint the world in a more explicitly large form, with the governor and laws to boot. This is incongruous with our actual wish for rest and being. The difference being that the latter finds a constant challenge in amending to the absolute, while the former merely floats inside a more loosely stitched bound of vastness, and instead brings the principal of those outskirts to their more local being, wherein the value of anatman and bliss measure the most relevant of affairs. "God in converse, is merely made so one 'can' care about something higher, rather than centering in on themselves."
    <br>&emsp;A last point I would make then, is that being high and absolute is no issue in itself, only that we don't try and surpass it, or reach it at least: for our place behind it initially suggests that we necessarily will not. Knowledge can be good, and in effect gives us more room and space to address ourselves in; but the mold should not match our casing, 'as if being a citizen of the country meant you were in line with the direct orders of the court'. Simply be one with the land; know its borders so that you don't feel so small, but use wisdom to garnish this knowledge as to more easily rest in the smaller findings that your in. "To me, Buddhist's bend towards the truth in the matter, however conceived their core tenants are; for it is the heart of the matter that counts, and the gift of joy and impermanence credits it the most."
    <div class="qu">If there were a sphere, and it was hollow and small, then so too would the elements inside ignite(as if embers) by density and pressure. Contrary to that, is a more open space, where things can float more easily and smooth; consequently, there is less room for you to become inflamed, as well as a more tempered and fruitful space for better feelings and cares to cultivate</div>
    What I think religious people do is extend the width of their ball into all of entirety. The reasons why are not so explicit, but comparing the alternative limit is otherwise warranted. What it comes down to is a state of permanence. Those in that former camp wish to live and rest in the halls of God; and they think that by aligning themselves to his will, that their own essence will be plastered in his realm of existence. "I say with even the most minor of assurances, that there is grave weakness in this claim; for it in many ways runs contrary to what He himself intended, or that you otherwise could if it were what he even wished." Perhaps that is why he arranged us the way that he does, as he could not give us the life of him. "And God seldom runs contrary." The point then, is that if we cannot reach this permanent state, then an impermanent one is what we are more clearly ordained to and thus right to achieve. This way has many woes however, as living in a small space can be cumbersome. However, we must be distinct when we regard our local pursuits of reasoning upon the whole of the world, as one which is merely illustrative, rather than an objective itself. "For even if we could see the lands and will of God, are we divine?" It seems that our wish to do so is a result of our otherwise encumbrance, yet Buddha's belief that this only arises through ignorance, suggests that our righteous place is not in abandoning those lands which we are clueless in. Instead of painting an absolute picture, let us merely draw one which has an all encompassing depth: but remains from our point of view. This has much ontological reasoning behind it, as well as ones of effective theology and sense; but nevertheless, we can say that our place within this domestic state is ultimately an impermanent one. "Thus we must arrange ourselves to be in accordance with that, rather than extending ourselves for the sake of what further habitations would provide." Put another way, the higher claims of permanence do not make it more just, nor do the limited gains from impermanence not remove its value. "For we ought only do better, whereby the removal of ignorance that would let us do so, would in itself show us and instate a reward worthwhile and appropriate."
    <br>&emsp;Let our studies resume then. As I have said prior, having more sensibility to the scope of the world is not a poor mark upon you, only that it should at most furnish your own local affairs, rather than be a progressive end in its own right -for those borders, however defined, will never be reached. In that, ought we incorporate ideas of that more personal living, as well as that of the whole we are illustrating. A quick point is worth adding. We tend to view entirety as a conceptual idea, whereas the bounds of space that we can see reflect more concrete bounds to the objects in question. "What entirety would be compared to what it is. The former though is limitless, and thus encourages mere valid deductions, while the latter is limited by virtue of its origin from our point of view: wherein only suggestion and likelihood is rightly permitted." In that, we need not know the whole for we have no aim(as our ability reflects) to act upon it. We may understand it more or less, but the borders of what it amounts to is a land we can never reach. The point though is that it is worthwhile to know what is in and around your borders. And admittedly it is serviceable to have terms that mark the whole of things, in principle or being that is; the use for these though is to wrap the things that we do know, wherein the entirety that we know can be assessed under the guise of entirety's form, while also remaining true to our own measurable limit. Practically speaking, Buddhism offers one the insight on how to locally be, while Vedic culture, or Brahmic religions rather, serve as those insights into the higher molds. "Again though, we merely wish to ask what things we know fit that higher reality. The former though, being better understood under the objective measure, is the subject and point of our resolve, rather than trying to extend ourselves to reach the borders of the objective measure itself." Perhaps our study in these Vedas will be best with such an aim in mind. "For we may otherwise be sucked into thinking that it's true. Or preferred over the nature of man for that matter."
    <br>&emsp;As a proxy for Brahmic thought, let us dive into Hinduism. For one, it is clear that in its case or Buddhism, that these are Dharmic practices. Simply, there are beliefs in how the world operates; the former tends to believe it is directed under a governing principle, while the latter holds causality as the key. Dharma though, means that in whichever case, that one attempts to align themselves with that guiding principle. In Hinduism's case, the goal is Atman, which is unity of their self with Brahman(the principle). Dharma is how they achieve this, with Purushartha being the objectives by which their actions become propper. Now, Brahman is the highest principal, of which Atman is indistinguishable; the difference is that the latter remarks the self of a thing, which in alignment becomes one with Brahman. There is a note though of limitation that this harmony can be reached, only approached. Nevertheless, there is a notion of Parabrahman, which marks aspects of reality which are beyond recognition, or lacking attributes. You might say that this reflects things which cannot be considered. In a similar way, Rta reflects the workings of the world; in a sense, it is the manifestation of what we see. Brahman is the underlying groove by which things slide, but into what sort of figure or form, Rta is the sum total of all that; and in effect makes that Purushartha subject to it as the objects of amendment. "Brahman gives the world its constitutional being, yet what it becomes is not so clear itself. Faith though is that the results are governed (while Buddhists believe they are from cause and effect), and to whichever end, say in economics or civil living, does our practical response assent to those. Purushartha reflects those objective reponses, while our principal self in line with Brahma, brings us out in a more fundamental way -wherein those practical actions manifest from, and towards." In a way, the bliss(ananda) that one reaches through this higher alignment is one of extension, as if their being is spread out over entirety -and in effect permanent. Buddhism on the other hand, is much more compact and local, in that our understanding of the world is one that removes us from wishing for or needing such extension or permanence; rather onto what manifests itself to us locally, we can simply be with that. Moreover, as those manifestations run in line with our active nature, then so too will we happily be. Moksha then marks the state of good within the latter, while the Hindus seek the bliss from extension. Additionally, there is the point of Satcitanada, which reflects one's experience of being in line with Brahman. An issue though is that if such an experience is placed, then so too would it fit within the domain of all personal experiences. Corresponding to that, is if our hand were on a flame it would be poor, as our nature is against this, while water for instance is not. The point, is that if our state upon true Atman is placed amongst our more natural forms of being too, then are we really besides the latter even if were in the former? "Are we not still men if we beith with Gods, or Brahman that is? If so, then what goods are there as each, as our peace and care for the latter is not acquired necessarily by the means and resolve to the former." The limits of extension then seem most relevant here; but we will let those notions drip a little, and come through our writings ahead.
    <div class="qu">Though I don't mind the concept of this extension, I believe it eventually runs its course as our active natures come into fruition. Moreso, as Rta for example, reflects the way things are as they manifest, then I am still unconvinced that these explanations of principal governance are anything more than abstract concepts aimed at giving a groove for certainty. For just as Rta reflects the way things are, so too is there an ontological term called Tanmatras, which in themselves mark 'subtle elements' which give rise to gross ones. Ostensibility seems to relate here explicitly. Consequently, does our need to cement the views of all that is ahead bring us away from the natures we have, that come from those principles which are otherwise indescribable. Giving them arms and legs though, merely seems self serving; rather than relating the core point of fundamentals in a suggestive sense, and resolving ourselves to be personal, yet with those absolute borders gently in mind. "As opposed to an infinite world in which I loosely cement myself onto, I would rather be in a relatively (but merely) wide world, truly, yet within so as my self, impermanently."</div>

 <div id="relations">
    I've met a woman; at the very least I see one. My history has only dealt me warranted disappointment in this regard. The cause is fairly clear, and the reason is, although somewhat less so, equally clear in kind. What I mean is that we overestimate our interest in other people, and equally their interest in us. The reason, is that we want someone; the root of our failure is we never try and get. How I would explain that is as follows. I mean to live as a consequent response to our idly retched youth. Moving from there, I wished to do more in that newly founded way, but it was hard. For one reason and some others, I wished the world to be easier so that I may reach that purer expression; the aim of that was, in some sense, to be rewarded for such efforts 'so that I would be able to further prosper'. In that case, it seems that our learned autonomy became one of need, akin to someone struggling for air. Unfortunately, we failed to assimilate the whole hearted way in which we sought to do it -and thus the demonstration and reverence for it was not within the spirit of the actual action, of goodness that is. In other words, as if we were clenching for the good because we were so previously struck by the bad, we never reached it, because the real good required a genuine approach - whereas our attempt lacked any righteous integrity
    <br>&emsp;Bringing us back to the point, that need for the good reflected my pure aim of demonstrating myself, but I was ingenuine in my attempt to do so; consequently, the trials of the world squeezed me out. At the forefront, was the desire for a woman as relief. Accompanying this, was the unflinching reverence to the good, but the impure make for it due to it being learned as a means of coping, rather than an aim sought for its own right. Therein, was I staked permanently towards a place in which I would not venture to elsewhere acquire, but improperly holding the post; consequently, was my need to relieve the effects of my errors manifested in the foremost means in which I could receive it: through a woman. What a woman wants and needs is its own discussion, but lets just say your focus must be in some ways towards her, deliberately. To clarify, what I wanted from the woman was that which would give me relief on my elsewhere goal; this amounted to sex, security and comfort. However, this should not be confused with what there is that a woman can offer. Particularly, we sought something from others in general, but leaned towards the goods of a woman: especially when the seemed to pair with that sounder path. "As it were, sex and fun alongside reason seemed the best thing: but life has a way of wringing both sides of a contrary towel dry."
 </div>
 <div id="simron">
     I leant in and gave her a kiss. At first she was still, then leaning into me further. I held place, softly scoring her lips gracefully by my side. She looked at me and I her, gently stairing into eachothers eyes. "Do you know what you've done," I said. She glared to the side, but replied "No, what is it?" I also looked down, but was ready to return forth: "You've met a man, and I am now one who can be so better." "Do you know what I have done?" she did not reply. "I have met a woman. And do you know what that means for you? You can be a better one as well." She turned her head as if some call had stirred her away; we were here though and of an address there was one she was happy, however unsure to to make. "this will never work," she said, "I have to much on my plate. I am not sure where or what this could be." I held her hand, and smiled. "Theres very little you could do for me, and theres is not that much I would ask or need of you. I just want you to know I care: and I want to know that you feel the same. If theres no time then lets accept that we are on our own, but together. That is what I want, it is the marbling of the comfort and security I seek. Perhaps then we would grow together to be as close as one: hopefully though, we will still be with eachother, together on our own however, is it green and good to be forever one." I have faith that she will smile and say 'O.K'. If she does then we will fortunately know, that be it at home in our hand, we are there; for even as I hope that when we cannot see, we'll at least know that we each onto the other care. And that is where I rest and lay.
    <br>&emsp;I am going to assume that Simron does not like me. She could, but I have only shown affection. If that itself turns out to bring us toether in a more clear and lasting way then I am fine and good on that. I believe i have mistaken though that these purer interests are meant to acquire something more vain and formal. Case in point, I made a direct call of seeing her latter; she replied with a almost flattered sentiment, but one of confusion. It is as if I have mistaken her acceptance of my caring with the plea to demonstrate that I like her more prominently; therein are my advances beyond that wholesome affection ones of uncertainty and weirdness. We are better off flirting like real mature adults, where we should our care through the calm relishment of eachother at our posts. I have no interest in being a item or a thing; furthermore, am I uninterested in running forth as to solidify something and materilazie it. If I were to reflect on that situation with Nicole, we rushed in and realized that we were wrong. If we had waited, it would have been more clear to me that she was only interested in being my friend: and I would have glady accepted that to. Consider yourself the best, and one who is trying to achieve and be everything that the want to do; do not think though that because there is room for frivality that it is warranted, or better yet to be regrettted if you are not. It is there for those who wish upon it, but the rest of the world is working on their buisness and pursuits - so each memebr may improve and raise their lives. There is enough to form a relationship on purer and sounder experineces. The worse thing to do is act like your not interested in that bravose way, but then flounder your way with the hopes of achieving the same. I know why your sad, for being so light in our interactions may not yeild us anything at all. Let there be the world for you then: and perhaps our settlement through that will procurr a lasting rise of those sweeter impressions, and leave you with something worthwhile and rounded.
    <br>&emsp;If Simron is vain then she may be struck by anothers brevity and make way for her. If she is not though then I feel like a pure connection moves beyond our common feelings. In their case, she might say that she doensnt have the time or capacity to be so formally interested and in love; if it was purely based on character and natural affection, then we would need not address the limitations set within our lives. In our case then would I advise that you not worry if she is unresceptible. I get to treat her well and nothing more; if she is inclined then were are set for a wholesome heart; she may not be so mature though, or is otherwise placed within a concentrated effort elsewhere. In any case though, I would remove any wearyness on the notion that she will be strung up by some other guy: it is neither what you are meant to do or what I personally wish to achieve: moreso is she likely not the kind for this and is thus more acceptable for our irreverant interest. Therein would I rest on the simplicty that you find in showing her affection - just dont rush it though
    <br>&emsp;I'd like to talk about love for one second. When she speaks to me, I try and listen without throwing something back at her; I simply say 'I understand', or 'alright'. You have to let someone in so that there joy can be expressed; that is how love is made, for just as you are interested in being generously the same, so will she be there if she has had the oppertunity to treat you similarly. I fear though that there is no where for me to so reticent; as well, is there no patience required from me. The world, however, offers such a scenario where here composure is worthwhile to humbly treat; moreoever, can you bear what she has to say, and return with a lighter remark - a smile perhaps.
    <br>&emsp;Simron and me are not going to work out. THis is a good thing though. I dont want to be joined at the hip or within some formal arrangment. I want us to be initmate and clear because the time we spend together is one out of interest and our own desire: rather than it being soemthing we ought to, or in some cases have to do. "As i have expressed, I am no longer looking for those more glamourous rewards from our sounder efforts. Those purer kinds of action may not lead you to something otherwise, neccessarily, but we can at least and be reassured that the course we followed and the results that we gained, were from being ourself. If Simron and I are to truly be togehter, then it should as ones who are onw there own, but sharing." A particular example I would draw is that our view of eachother is somewhat situated by our postion together; in that sense, she is this girl that I see from time to time and nothing more. However, when i do see her, I am approrpiralytey kind and affectionate, while also letting her act similarly - I hear what she has to say, and let her hear what I am saying. Therein, would our other collugues view of oursevles be taken from the interactions of two people who are not circumstanitally ordained. In other words, it is our regularity of natural interest that shows and marks our current state of relationship along with the way it will develop - she will continue to be that girl who I see amidst others and the world. Therefore, my understanding is that it is within that limited scope where we are brought togehter, that I would treat her the way I would if I truly meant to see her forever. Therein, there is no rush or regret - so long as our situation remains.
 </div>
 <div id="humble">
    My assessment following this is that we are overall fine. In our heart there may be frivolity and remorse, but it is to no lasting prevail. Simron will either gradually respond towards our truest self, or treat us not to either this or something otherwise vain: in that, I do not otherwise care. In terms of prospects the ground is settling; moreover, are we bringing ourselves into a more prominent state where we have more to offer and give. Therein does the receding demands of us and our increasing ability to address them in whatever required way, feel more acceptable and approved; thus, my sight on friendship has more stake as we can more outwardly and genuinely be -thus attracting whomever would share an interest by my side. As well, does our hope for erecting the means for a community seem more operable, as both our skills and clarity have solidified, and we are thus more able to productively proceed.
    <br>&emsp;In other words, when it comes to the world and our tribute ahead, the lane is open to us more and more, and we are increasingly capable. "It is as if our rate of income is furthering whilst the cost of production is lowering: therein are the finances of our heart and mind becoming more neat and easily tidy." Furthermore, I would add that due to this natural and gracious equanimity, our vanity is losing its place. For too long have we been concerned about the probable cause of our genuine efforts to treat us with ingenuine rewards. Simply put, they should not be regarded, either in our humility or direction: only the good shall have our mind and way.
    <br>&emsp;Regarding the bones of this all, the whole is feeling good. In terms of our ability our diet and training are rounding themselves well; especially and, moreso, are they(however immature) of a full and encompassing kind. It is true for example that our pushups are still in a minor state, but that they are viable for regular treatment is both true and reminiscent of our use of it. In other words, we are doing the right things well across the board and simply using a sounder side of our brevity and a more wholesome version of our strength, so we may make it through the shortcomings that correspond with those things being an incomplete case of themselves. In doing so, however, are they firming up, and, consequently, I am beginning to feel a more permanent state of spryness and rigor, evenly I might add. Adding onto that is the sound place of our diet and its consistent treatment of our position. "As a thing which is a hallmark of uncertainty and need for adjustment, it is settling into my liking and extending out as to make it more malleable, whilst keeping stability within its central core." Effectively, I have addressed two usfull times for kinds of eating. First, there is the place for veg and light food. During this period you are set to work and read, train and write, and in association eat tuna, salads, fruit and other veg. Upon the reach of this is a rinse of it all required before moving on to the nourishment of the day. In that case, giving yourself a poignant rest will relinquish the system from the effort built up through the day and allow it to proceed into the latter evening with a lightened freshness. Effectively, when you begin to eat your starch and grain they are not intruding onto a finished state - where you would otherwise be left in a heavied haze. Instead, the body is reaffirmed and betted from the rinse and given more openings for that hearty nourishment to be had through the latter portion of the day. How it ends is not so strictly clear, but a similar place for veg has my approval once the evening has come to a close and the night is beginning to wake. In that case, carrots, almonds, tea and other minor versions of veg are acceptable and, moreover, congenial to our satisfying interests as we wind down into the end of our day. This contrasts nicely with the sullied grievance of having rice or bread near and around nine; in that case you are left with a sense of sulkiness, as well as a remission to rest and go to bed. Sleep is desired but it is of a sluggish kind. Your better set is within a stout yet lightened slate wherein some minor food was munched upon, leaving you with a more wholesome gaze onto the walks, writing, stretch and cheer that more preferably ends an otherwise great day.
    <br>&emsp;All that being said, there is the actual reason for this to tend to. In the case of provisions, as for health I have already said, our job is going similarly well. To propose what this is for though is best met with an elaboration of what it is I wish for these duties to treat. Herein, I am currently set on developing a definition board. As a prior, we had set up 'objective' boards, wherein we expanded upon our goals and desires and subjected ourselves to how we wished to spend our time, as well as what we wanted to do and accomplish. The definition board is an extension of these particular points into a further sentiment of what they actually are. For example, we have said that films are worth our treatment and we have given several that we mean to see; what we already know and are prefaced towards in vying for in each, is less exposed and understood -clearly stated at least. What is best then is, in some sense, to elaborate on what it is you wish to tribute towards. For example, in the case for There Will Be Blood, I would foremostly like to express my admiration and care for the reality that the film expresses, wherein the gritted and gluttunous violence of outlaws in gangs (in a western setting) is avoided and, instead, is replaced with a more seemingly accurate and responsible depiction of a world which is quiet and kind, and if not so, is marred by personal defects in ones character and what consequences those brings. "Seeing people subject to mere stupidity feels unantagonistic, and rests with my lovely view of the world -whereas drama and vile caricature does not." Compared to an otherwise illustration of a violent world through the guise of drama and common assessment, There Will Be Blood shows me that forever on as time goes and all that it has ever been, has been fair and light in the commons, and that all trouble was scorned from our own poor decisions, and equally dealt with within the frame of our character'd demands. Therein, does this quality portrayal of the world reflect that more gregarious and sound sentiment 'that no matter the fortune or trial, it is irreverent in the scale and thus, measured by us and how we choose to treat it'. This is my feeling about There Will Be Blood. There is a good performance by Daniel Day Lewis, as well as a palpable narrative that reflects the expected consequences of ambition -as the title suggests, and Daniel shows. As well, is it just full of details that interest my mind, and is thus definable within my measure of the subject, that being the film in this case or some show of another. These are merely the terms though, the subjects: it is their meat on the bone that reflects their further meaning and thus my interest. Onto that of all the parts and kinds, is what the definition board seeks to, and like the objective is able to, elaborate on and find. In other words, if the world is such and we are keen to see it, then drilling in what it is that we see is understandable when it comes to the possibility of future tribute: for we will then have had to give our sculpture a figure defined. "Which gives my creative avarice much clarity to proceed."

 <div id="arrival">
    We are here, at our home in Kamloops: living with Mom and Dad -Dora and Boots too. The area around is banked towards our mind and goodness, along with accommodations for serious training. Food seems agreed upon and set within frequent acquisition. "As I have begun to say, dried fruit before bed is proficient, whereas popcorn, treats of bread and or french fries and springrolls, are all sufficient -whereas sweets and sugar, ignorant drug use, starch and grain before bed, 'and the attempt to step outside yourself as compared to dining on and forever bringing forth what reflects your constitution' are each ill sufficient."
    <br>&emsp;For the sake of discursiveness, I can say that our formal efforts fall in line with developing a website that marks the brand of Ryan Michael Green. As well, developing our Twitter book and all its elements will see suitable promise and additions to our clarity -due to the condensed and or topical nature. Following this are direct initiatives into the professional world; whether it is in the scope of Yoga, Photography, writing or programming, the buildings and people involved serve as ripe opportunity to show off your skill and, in return, earn people's attention and interest of both noticing us and offering collaborative efforts(more or less). Similarly, will taking our writing that we have already done, editing it as to be sharp and defined, then putting it onto Medium, Linkedin and other appropriate websites, will offer us a comparable means of showing our efforts and, again in turn, receiving the supposed profits and rewards. "I'd remark what Emerson says where he defines the great man as one who brings himself fully forth, consistently, on his own or in the crowd. What he goes on to further say and what I take this to effectively mean is that if we mean to be strong and true then we must hold ourselves accountable and resolute, as if we mean to and are happy to do so indefinitely.
    <br>&emsp;Considering the nature of friendship and privilege I can say that these things find their fit to the proper suiter; that is to say that whether they are present or not, our steps towards ourselves remain. Therein, will our forward expression merely rest on the fact that we are trying to be and produce the best version of ourselves; so much as we are fortuned or powerful will those goods we seek settle by our side; they are not the aim though, per say, as our fundamental line is where we primarily meet. These gains of ours are merely the crust in which our inner demonstrations are followed, 'as if they are molding themselves like moss on a solidifying tree'. My point is that although the sun's rise and our leisurely increase from a friend is worthwhile and appreciated, they are merely what makes our advances an accomplishment: they themselves cannot be sought. Instead, our effort should go(as said) towards bearing ourselves through the world in the most constituted and wonderful way. The point being that even if this treated you to the bounty of a king, you'd still be a man. And good for it because in whichever offer you gained, would reason and grace nestle it into your side wherein the treats would be lasting and scrumptious -by that sense and appreciation. The flipside of this are those acquisitions that see the one who reached them left at the door; I would say that those things which are truly good are those which measure up to one who remains forever with themselves. "The rewards then that you receive from this well founded point, will thus stay as actual profits to the suiter: that is, the vessel for the offer to take. Or in other words, if you remain wholesome and true, will things that you receive continue their possibility of offering their goodness: for the applicant of their service has stayed."

    There is very little that is asked of me. Sometimes we have to drive to get food, or at a rare moment there is a request to shovel or help someone move. Generally though we are at home, whether reading or playing, or out and about on walks or a run. The mold for this is cruel from all the requirements it offers us, 'promising that if we abide then riches will be mine'. And I dance with this devil, a little, but I only give a gracious smile: for if he takes me, then the wish for peaceful and lasting goodness will defer to a more red and hotly ambitious aim.
    <br>&emsp;There is good infront of me, like a field of interest and joy that I move through as I continue to further and be. "It is those steps which you naturally take that deserve our attention." In the core is a respect that determines how the field is experienced; this, in short, refers to one's values and appreciation, wherein those that you have will more actively spark what you experience and see. However, this amounts to our inner reasoning and desire. This is important, but merely preliminary, a warm up if you will, or strategy rather. What we need far more than this -principally and seeing as the former has been given all the time and effort- is something that shapes our universal ability to proceed at all, and take whatever it is that we seek in. In other words, we ought to know how to pass a ball and where to run if a certain goal or object is our aim; on the field though, we need sharpness in our mind, a strength of character to remain both heads up and composed, yet relaxed and stress free(as there is in fact no competition).
    <br>&emsp;"By definition will our primary ethic suppose that our factual interests and direction will correspond to our agency and progressiveness." What this amounts to is tailoring the objects of one's mind and inborn nature as to calibrate itself to 'reasonable things, and thus goodnesss', so that our heartfelt steps run in such accordance. "We should mold ourselves so that when our activity takes, or our attention is grabbed, that it is more tuned towards things that were previously seen to be good -from which we determined through more deliberate and rational times." This may be our easiest illustration. You will wake up, then have brunch, lunch, dinner and a closing snack or two; you will then go to bed and do it all over, without question. Those of us with more free time, or at least an open amount to be considerate, will read some books, write some essays or reflection, stretch a little here and likely workout a lot more over there; and to each and all, for better and worse, will some thing at the very least be done, and relevant to goodness if it is agreeable to our living aim. "That is exactly what one ought to, for the sake of benefit, wholeheartedly do."

 <div id="reign">
    I moved up here because my dad was sick; moreso was his immediate treatment the main facilitator in me being so quick to transition. Currently though it is as if the situation is not the case. The cancer as I know it is still there, though, there has been a note that the severity of it is not so strong; put another way, the presence of it is alarming and, moreso, is representative of an almost necessary doom: it is just not going to be tomorrow. Beyond my actual place here and what effects that, I can still say that my Mom and Dad are looking to travel. The fact that I am here is both a means for them to do so or, at the very least, reflects the fact that this is what they ultimately mean to do. This is good. Beyond my dad's sickness and treatment, the resolve to travel in the near future is one that sees my position secure -as it is valued based on the support that my being here offers them in their pursuit to travel[so that I may look after the house and cats]. That being said, it seems clear that we are set here within our own liking, at least till some future resolve is made where I am no longer needed; or, better said, when my place becomes contextualized by what I personally need and seek, then we may address ourselves and how we'll act then. It may be the case that we choose to move, or that our time here is still consistently spent and so we remain.
    <br>&emsp;One of the reasons for our stability here is that beyond the inherent access to food and work, the actual quality of living is strong. It is the winter after all and the cold has some drain, but no ambitions or demands are placed upon us. In the warmer months there is a possibility of suggestion, but we can least rest on being saddled into the opportunities offered by the land; or, moreso, to the means for fitness and its association with a generally free and hospitable home and environment. In short, the time that may ask us to move or 'grow up' will not be fostered by the necessity of 'improving our position'. When my parents no longer need me and my situation is personally staked, my choice can still be to make use of the free time as we have. In that case we may end up here till next winter. It is possible that after their initial travels that the question of work and 'our' future will be brought to question: but we can then surely move, or rest our contentment in making use of the time as we seek.
    <br>&emsp;This is an important point. To live in Vancouver requires that we work, or at least meet the requirements to hold room and bread. Doing so is not to my benefit though - when all is accounted for. I prefer to be free, fully; the main reason is that our values have more room to be self defined and targeted, as opposed to being concerned with their 'fortuned offering'. Herein will our truer interests have the room to establish themselves and expand, the result being a more significant reward because they were so unique and wholly made. If it comes to the summer and there is a question of a job, then I will go where that responsibility is fitting. If the request though is banked on my benefit and interest, then I will likely refrain. In all homes and land can I walk and travel, see and be pleased, study and write, stretch and train, watch and game, and think and plan in general, or assess. "All responsibility gives is one more time." If the need for this is barred by riches and splendor, then the duties will follow. My time is personally set when I have access to a consistent room and bread: and this is very easy to acquire. Moreso, if the hold of this is bound through privilege or patronage, then our use of it is effectively open -wherein there is no labor, only respect. In that case we can rest on the moments of peace, thinking about our life and what we want to do -and getting a similar grip on the situation and the free time that it provides.
    <br>&emsp;There are no stipulations for me living here. The openness does admittedly reveal the uncertainty we have without much trouble, but I think that this can be mended thoughtfully over time. Let us just take to be true that all is the same: the distinction is in the maker, of which we are sowing. We live in Kamloops; it has access to food and bed in good supply and quality; moreso is this offered to us through mutual respect. Indefinitely this will not remain nor will my interest likely forever stay; but in terms of what we are being asked to do and how that duration seems to suggest its longevity, does suggest that the situation we are in as it is will be in place for a great deal of time.
    <br>&emsp;What we are best to do is to assay the living in our lives. What draws you, what do you mean to work for and be; these are the questions that, if answered, will earn you some track and bearing, and therein composure amidst the wake of the world -especially when you are somewhere privileged or new. My limit though is that if I start somewhere, then the mold that I build around it that accounts for its place and called for action, will not likely include the scope of things that are equally deserving, through my interests, of similar treatment. And this is fair in its truth. A great deal of the objectives which I'm referring to are built out of ideal interests; or in other words, they were forged into something more actionable from a looser substance of inkling and whim. The issue is that their place despite being more full, is not within the sight of me. In fact nothing is, for we are not asked to name one. In some sense our prior development was born from the prominence of those whims being drawn out as a response to work and its necessity. Currently, the whole of the world bears the only demand of duty and obligation; for the stretch ahead the air is open and free for me to live and be. Respect is required though as the simplicity within the offer is only sustained by your congruence towards the family; in doing so we can expect food and a room, and all the land around our bed. Nothing more though. Forwardly thinking, we ought to gather ourselves into a more desiring position, wherein our aims are uncovered and clearly seen; therein we can establish them and outline a path for accomplishment. Right now though, I merely have the introductions of sight: our best is to get drawn to the scenery

    I moved out here on the 26th. From that Saturday it will be three weeks this coming weekend. That isn't that long admittedly. There are two mistakes I have made though. One is that I binged chocolate and chips on the third night as well as smoking twice. "Gosh did it make me irritable, short and tense." Following this I vowed never to have sugar, but choose to have pralines; these were admittedly satisfying and not severely bad, but the sugar was still terrible. Now, be it in states of proficiency or sufficiency, sugar and weed have no place, explicitly.
    <br>&emsp;Christmas is coming along with many meals and moments of cheer and pleasure; on that last note I amend not to eat chocolate or crap. World Cup is finishing this week, Dad is home next week, Avatar comes out and will be seen during Christmas; on the eve we will be having Piaea; Jess is coming on the day, leaving a few after with Mom and Dad. We are going to get some games and underwear hopefully along with a host of great books(of new or introduced editions) early next month. Hopefully by that time the peak of the cold will begin to subsist and we can get back into it being at worst cool; moreover, will the ability to more easily be outside paired with the dryness of the weather permit a cloud bonanza, 'from both the east and west'.
    <br>&emsp;I will mention training and food but there is a comment worth making first. In the colder months we are generally susceptible to poorer eating, smoking, a lack of training that follows, as well as more concerns about our place in life and a hesitance to look ahead with certainty (with the apprehension within rotation associated with that). The point though is that considering the lesser time outside and the increased difficulty in training, I would say that our choices should respect the fact that although what we wish for is good and that no amount of bad is amendable, we at least notice that our condition is harsher and narrower for us to be as resolute and simple as if it were summer or spring.
    <br>&emsp;Food and training in some shape or form come hand in hand. Starches and grain fill the bulk of our nourishment whilst dried fruit, some nuts and veg make for heart and sustenance. The strongest choices here are in having figs before bed instead of bread and grain along with keeping your starches to a later point during the day - which we will call the evening. Training wise there is strength and aerobic activity as well as the recovery and stability sessions. The latter is less than we would hope for and generally marks the limit for us being more composed and regular in our rigorous training and activity ahead. At the core of it there are forward folds, chaturanga, runners lunge, bridge and boat. Do these and everything else from strength and recovery will follow.
    <br>&emsp;A quick mention on our individual efforts earning us both a generous expression and receipt. The former refers to the value we bring within a transaction whilst the latter reflects that the 'customer' received the good on offer. This is important in our conception of aspiration and development. Before, we were a little muddled on the method or way of thinking about success and fulfillment; now, we can view it as truly being the greatest version of ourselves, wherein the contribution is rooted from the heave of our heart, but, in effect, is done so in such a grandly hilted way that the impression on offer is both substantial and rewarding for those seeing it. The point being that our generous interest and the associated stand which best houses the increased amount of attention and care, indicates a possible and or likely transaction and thus receipt.
    <br>&emsp;One thing to consider is whether or not our view of the world and the resolve we have moving through it, should be based on our individual situation or as if we were in a state of success. The former point suggests that our accomplishments are not guaranteed and are consequently based on aims, rather than expectations. The latter sentiment is more wide and loose; in its case, we may see the road more open and thus feel more suited for a broader amount of work and intention; the issue though is that things can be seen as necessary and possible based on the freedom that we supposedly have, and thus their promise and amendment are resolved because we can -compared to seeking so because it is our actual desire and aim. In our stiffer state, I'd measure the latter as being more prominent; in part the reason is that our relaxed nature would otherwise rest on our own interests as well as the frailty and indifference of the world; on the other hand, a restless and overly decisiveness nature rears itself when my grasp on promise and activities are shortened, along with the prominence of our ability to treat them -wherein our involvement would keep us present and seeing rightfully ahead from the current steps.
    <br>&emsp;I bring all this up because my clarity is being torn a little from a natural stiffness. This is in part due to ineffective choices that regard our lessened state upon eating sugar, traveling and its prior repercussions, as well as a minor setting of drugs. Our head is up though and my spirits are nothing short of high: though they are not many in optimism or vibrant stability. Rather they are somewhat unsettled, wrestling instead to say more and be more descriptive of the elements discerned through previous better days. Simply put the best thing for us to do is offer the most; it will draw us, further us and bring us the present of friendship and righteous plunder. It seems clear that our place in the world, be it in the smallest and most local of matters or in the reaches of grand glorious ways, is only approached and developed well when you produce an abundance of steps. Explicitly then, will this advance continue as much as those steps are regular and with consistent substance.
    <br>&emsp;I will rest on the principle of fortune and the irrelevance of position; respecting the fact that values increased are what drives us to feel like we are going through the greatest days, strongly implies that putting yourself forward in a way that brings you forward the most, will achieve the attraction of those around as well as rising to a generous point in which that comradery and welcomed tribute is of and for the foremost things -and the treatment of them that measures and marks the utmost claim. "Nothing has felt so far and round." The reason this is true is that from it I will proceed the most: with the merits of taking soundly steps being what makes this just, and thus a legitimate claim.

    We are underestimating the value of sitting and standing. Everyone will goe through ups and downs but upon the latter easier things must be understandably done. In this case, if rigour and eveness have left your chest and torso, then simply stand then sit. "you may find that in your thinner state, that doing so is mightily restorative; at thatt point then, you may reach a stabler and encouraging point where aerobic, strenght, power and restfull training can be done."
    <br>&emsp;CHristmas is here and I am all set to remain with myself. I have not pledged though to forgo the popcorn I initially set to have during Avatar. Perhaps I could compramise with one. The issue is that I had a hearty helping of packaged popcorn the other day. What I've noticed is that despite having worked our prior that this intake shattered all my strenght; it isnt drawing us into the ground like sugar, but I am definitely in a neutral state. As a consequence we went back to bed, with the blanket mind you, and I am now short of where Id like to be in composure and breath. Ive realized that things are never to little and that a lesson can be simply learned. "for the sake of writing, reading and studying along with proper strength, aerobic, power and restfull training, I will arrange myself with these in mind and refer to what they deem appropriate as the measured scale." To that, would the occasion of a three hour movie on christams warrant some popcorn, especially when treats, quiche, turkey and junk are not otherwise had. The Boom Chicka Pop was not appropriate, I admitt that. It's issue is it's own though and the consequences that we faith are not clearly as suscpetible when it comes to Movie Popcorn. The point being that even though we were drrained a bit, that our feeling was hurt more compared to the actuall future effect. In that, I mean to train now and tomorrow, followed by some aerobic work on the day of the movie. I understand how the steps infront of that will be surely hampered. "A issue to raise is that having rest for the day or two to follow because the prior days were for training, does not mean that doing nothing and eating poorly is appropriate." At least we are homest with ourselves; our decision then will be begrudgingly made, or seen as alright: the aim though which it is measured by earns us the most considerate respect.

 <div id="path">
    I see our efforts running us a great length of time. The better website will take a while to develop as will the Twitter and Linkedin projects, but for the most part they're taking the right steps. Infront with respect to where we're headed -as well as what we are looking to achieve- sees a good deal of unknown. I am familiar with what I wish to accomplish, but these aspects feel outside of my control. The notion goes that value is self determined and, in effect, alters the impressions and or experience of the outside world. "I use the example of valuing rigor and lightness in our work and how this bends our responsibilities towards this line, compared to being otherwise laborious. by virtue of being ignorant of what we seek -by no resolution, there is no adjustive bend."
    <br>&emsp;The word accomplishment reflects this strongly when it comes to our ultimate outcome; for one, if we reach a certain point or position, then it will be our values and aims that render the situation as personal to us. What I seek is to watch the sunrise and have a friend; to be precise, I am looking for regional flexibility and enhanced leisure through friendship. In terms of appropriation, it is clear that whatever fortune and freedom that we have upon success will not go towards bringing these interests out if they are not clear and cut as values or aims. "Consider this: you wish to drive a car for the thrills and excitement; you become rich and successful and are thus able to buy the car. On the flipside, your aim might have been to travel, of which your riches could then satisfy. If you acquire a good deal of wealth, but lack any aim, then you may spend it frivolously, and be then left with idle amounts of gold."
    <br>&emsp;True friendship and pastoral freedom are my purest aim. The reality though is that these reflect my state of indifference to the world and how I would be if it were the case. It is more likely that these interests can be broken down into particular activities that, however limited in comparison, represent the time you actually wish to spend within this liberated state. In that case, we might say that our interest in watching the sunrise is one of personal freedom; actively though, our active interest may be to travel around Vancouver for the sake of photography, or, moreover, is our baser interest in writing and deliberation similarly revealed. When it comes to these objective interests, then our direct initiatives and or present pursuits can tailor themselves as to bring this line out -that is, towards these objectives.
 </div>
 <div id="theroad">
    I am unsure of my overall aim. Filling up the sides have been those prior years of preparation and reason'd reverence, yet I do not know what it is for. This may illustrate the trouble I'm having. If you were in the desert you would see your life and decisions with respect to the heat and the sand; if you were with a group of people, you may be more clear and open to the workings of a team as well as the presence of people as a whole. I feel that since we are on our own though, our ambition is set within that respect. This is not to say that we are doing something wrong. It may be the case that working with others can dilute your own interests and purpose, but you would still have some no less, merely together. The reality I find though is that most people are not so keen to be deliberate and objective; rather, the bulk of the common effort is along a focused path that will yield more fortuned rewards. I myself however am looking for the ways and reasons to actually live well. I proudly confess that any sort of arrangement and address that reflects that is fine and dandy to me. I can accept that a partnership, or a team, requires a mixing of whole, of which no particular member is in control of any key emphasis. Despite being fine though, there are seldom any suitors that mean to exist(however uniquely) on that side of living. "A company for profit is quite easy to join or found, but one of interest and wholesome reward, that is hard to take part in outside private effort. But therein I lie."
    <br>&emsp;The workings here aside, I can say that the issue in my life within these regards, is that I know very little who have such passions in a substantial way. Most people are actively ambitious or not so, but their direction is in improving their position; the simpler of the two merely accepts what they have and makes the best use of it, though it is in a satiating way; the more ambitious side, looks to improve what they have and thus bars down along the path that offers this: it is similar though, for the position's sake. We on the other hand are more concerned with how we are going to live. The trouble though is I am not sure exactly how and where that could be. One point is worth noting that reflects our similar desire to advance, but for what kind of living the position allows. This is at the heart of our foolish desire, as it suggests that there are things that can be done in one position and not within the case your in right now. This has some merit, but on the whole it does not stand. On one hand, there is the notion of friction and how your active time can be easily spent; our ambition then may be to remove the shackles so we may be more openly and simply artistic; this is in some ways a sound choice, but merely a reflection along the common path: beneath this there is either some or none of the grounding definition of what it is you wish to do, and thus the grip onto it that would naturally follow. Effectively, if we use the time that we have to clarify our interest -regardless of our toil- then the aims we have will at least be laid out and make clear how they are promising. Therein, if we are troubled to be a certain way, we can at least know what it is we are being held back from: in contrast to knowing little in this case, would the aspiration to go somewhere where the efforts were more clearly firm and heavy be unjust and reflective of your poor thinking now.
    <br>&emsp;We are making something from nothing, as I say, and this does not suggest that others will immediately see, or likely be in the same position. We are most fortunate to have grown up in a world that was open for all yet set for little; therein, no harm that I incurred left me with any deep misfortune; rather, it was only a lack of clarity that unfolded along my way, and thus my response was to embellish more focus and objectivity. Doing so in this free and modern age, means that those interests that I discerned to have, could be molded and staked on the impression that they were both viable and achievable. Greatly then, I am then trying to figure out what it is I would like to accomplish; because even though I have made great use of this open lane for a change of and resolve through my newly founded interests, the world and the people in its whole are still generally set in seeking more from it, rather than themselves. "And in that it is hard to find the rewards and promise of a friend."

 <div id="ubiquity">
    Even though our future is ill defined, our past has a fine bearing and present grip. For example, we know where we have come from and what we have so far achieved; it is simply the case that these things are perhaps in need of some of their own refinement, following through to a more substantial deliberation onto what lies ahead. We are resting too far from the proper place of assessing where we are. We live on earth and that is not going to change. Even if SpaceX is able to send someone to Mars in the next ten years, it will be another ten before a minor colony is set up, and likely 15 before there is a tangible settlement. For people like us who are common to our own planet, this is all we got. Moreover, are national lines drawn in a way that only those of a traveling or merchant class can significantly surpass. Seeing the Yangtze or the woods of Bengal does have this aesthetic appeal, but it is only within my leisurely dreams; furthermore then, when we assume the kind of people who will be able to see these, we must also assume that their place is one of busy mobility: wherein the streets of Delhi or the fields of Mozambique are passed by while occupied. Compare this to the local living of every single person in their present home, and you can see that besides the dreams we have of being able to move around, no place is that special. Or, better said, that vision we have is only with respect to traveling around; and this would be nice, but is only accessible to those with the assets to do so. I would not limit the interest of these within that class of folk, rather I would suggest that the brevity of their positions grants comparably little time for such pleasantries and aesthetic interest. In other words, those able to travel are as such from their agenda to go places and further their position; that they would relish the grasslands of the Great Steppe or the violent blue of the East China Sea, is not so likely: and if so, then that scenario we will conclude as just.
    <br>&emsp;Its many intricacies though must be further explained, as the brief view of it is that our heartfelt dreams are not in their case compatible or desired. The point I am trying to make reflects that notion of becoming wise after a conquering; determining the value of this is troubling as the inquiry is burdened by syllogisms and dialectics -if this then that they say, or, if so, then no wonder this is worth addressing(and so on). The reason perhaps is that we are too incomplete in our own definition and thus need to offer consideration for an opposing side -as to remove our own assumptions. The sentiment is a struggling one for it marks the breadth of our time and effort upon all other things; the regard though of what one ought to do in this world (as we have explained to be our explicit place) is simply a leading requirement -for the rest of our intentions and interests are valued from and based off this. I believe the remedy is within the removal of a logical error one makes in the claim 'if I could then I should, for why would I otherwise not'. The notion goes that, money for example is not to be taken, within reason, as the highest value and aim. Even the lowliest of us could at least administer a claim on this as being true, regardless of their (or anyone's) resolve or action to it. But, as our first premise, would acquiring some not be so bad; in fact, on a similar basis of what seems obvious, would it be acceptable and preferred. We are living creatures after all and within our current state of the world, money reflects the means for obtaining what it is that we need. Again, we could at least within reason admit this is feasible. The other side of this though is with regards to how money is really acquired. Would you live forever if you could, well sure: but who is yielding you this? And, if so, would your resolve not be in line of doing what is good from this fortune? Moreso then, could we not simply say that the right thing is what brings all paths into their respectively proper way? Therein, if the highest of fortunes still ask that we use them well, then would any other situation not require of us the same?"
    <br>&emsp;This is a strong philosophy and can serve as an uprooting principle: we are trying to step back from the front though, away from assumptions I might add. To illustrate where the confusion lies, we could draw the point that being able to work towards acquiring money is seemingly more profitable than be unable and with lacking. The question then is should this be our ambition, in acquiring money that is? Well at this point we could reflect on the value of such achievement and concern ourselves with the nature of its real offer, and thus see whether anything is really accomplished. In doing so, we could reasonably say that our status and fortune would improve, and that our place having grown alongside this progression would see us similarly matured; perhaps not though, as our attention may have been elsewhere, or set otherwise beyond the proper use of those former gains.
    <br>&emsp;What one should do is simply difficult to suggest or defend. For one thing, without a reason why a particular effort should be desired, then our baser and innate interests have no real competition or means of prevention. The idea though is that due to our more thought out and considerate thinking about the world and its offer, we are implicity sided with all that which is above those primitive grounds. The difference is that one needs little justification for its ground and is purely based on what the agent impulsively seeks; the contrasting role though is in need of stronger reasoning and assessment as that is what it is set on doing. I am losing track though. All that matters is what we are right to do. What is best then is that which is honed to and in accordance with that. The casing however is tricky for we end up within a dialectic. I'll let it go and see if some sleep and activity can spurr some clearer thoughts into my mind. As it stands, to reiterate, there is a field of uncertainty and our partial acquaintance through it; shouldering this is strict knowledge of our scenario: our goal then is in furthering that line so that the material inside has a more firm and in depth shell: for we can then proceed without certainty yet well.

 <div id="ledger">
    My past writings are in need of some proper arrangement -with the aim of sharpening them up for display. The portions set for this portrayal are those of typing -even though I have written a lot elsewhere. This began in the spring of 2020. At this time I was coping with the troubles of women and responsibility foremost, though, some measure of leisure and joy was still being reinforced. These truly were the roots of my prominence, 'and I owe my trunk and its treats from the preliminary works of that'. As it stands there are about 5 or 6 pages of several paragraphs each; most are within a speculative and value forming state. However, there is some brief mention of specifics, within the heart of it at least; actually, on one page's account there is a strict list of brief statements that are more particular and clear. In any case, these are our roots and worth mentioning thus within our aim of refurbishment and portrayal.
    <br>&emsp;Following this period I was quite indifferent in my life; my choices were inconsistent and my aims were few; consequently, conflict arose and my bearings wained. In effect my considerations became more fundamental, falling substantially onto the floor of Theology. In the latter year this sentiment was carried forth in subsequent sets of work and production. I learned CSS and HTML, building a web page that would continue to host my efforts for the year that has till this point come. The first batch of works was a group of writings called 'On Things'. The aim of these was to establish some sort of footing by means of inquiry within core concepts. The pieces were as follows: On Gods, On Parenting, On Things, Of Residency, On Rome, The Method, On Validity, Of Cosmology, The World and, lastly, a Nature of Numbers. These are each worthy of a sharpened treatment like those earlier reflections. A key note of distinction is that these pieces contain way more subjection to actual elements of the world, whereas those personal inquiries were almost purely set within establishing a scale to judge; in that case, as will be similar for the efforts ahead, is their some worth in going over these works and treating them tributively -or giving our thoughts on the matter, a report if you will. For example, in the case of On Gods, there may be sentiments of pantheism or the nature of deities that is worth elaborating on.
    <br>&emsp;The batch of writing that follows is comparable, though I'd say it is of a more tailored kind. The group could be broken up into 2 categories, one being historical treatment(as there are so many) and one of solid reflection and creation. To the latter this includes works inspired from Elden Ring and Civ as well as a good amount of heartfelt description; on the other end of this are pieces which reflect insights of our heart, or at least further clarities onto more practical matters. Hallmarking these are three key essays: On Norms, On Monogamy and On Careers. These encapsulate the reach of my thinking at the time and provide a good measure of our heartfelt direction -as well as being the furthest that our writing(at the time) could reach. The former section is much easier to describe in comparison. It includes the following: On Greece and On Protestantism, Medieval Philosophy, The Middle Ages and The Renaissance. Some of these have been given a formative treatment despite having room to still improve; nevertheless, they are all well produced from the ground up and a strong contributor to the group -which we have called Winter Writings. Moreover, do these latter historical writings reflect the extent to which I could write, whereas that prior one is more reminiscent fo our ability to think and inquire.
    <br>&emsp;This time was a good one. We were void of drugs(as we have continued to be) and our direction in life had both consistent success and enjoyment. Later in the spring we moved to Vancouver. At this time we developed a journal that would hold the bulk of our future writings in a larger way. At first, I wrote about the land and our place as one in the midst of present fortunes. As time went on I furthered my sketchings onto sentiments of maturity, being alright with death, being thoughtful in our judgments and furthering our home within consistent inquiry. Later that summer we got a job at Superstore and a great deal of my strenuous time(in regards to writing) became centered on solidifying our time spent within the role, as well as strengthening or reasons for adherence. Within this stage we advanced the notions of natural tendency and congruence to our congenial actions; foremost though was the principle of our limit, wherein our need to explain everything was simply unnecessary due to the fact that in whichever state we reached, our action would still follow. This point in our recent lives bent us towards a resolve and thinking based on a first principle. Following this period into the early fall I developed a Diary. The aim of this was to make room for more sparse and unwhole messages; initially, I used it in this way but furthered my additions into more substantial topics. Notably, I made several large pieces on our familial and developmental history; as well, did I advance our interest and hold within communal ambition -rooted in the network state and development of a community. The subsequent stage of which I am generally still in, worked its way through more firm and objective treatments of the world and its elements, along with outlining a considerate view of justice and the law. "Building on this I have cultivated a fully rounded stake within living properly and well." Alongside this, there has been a warm and welcomed response to our place in life and its just interest of solidifying the terms for candidates to become subject for generous treatment, sound judgment and well founded inspection. This writing that we have summarized marks the origin of our coming set of projects. Shouldering this are lectures on reason and theology, cosmology and the history of earth -as well as the recorded history of man. In terms of tribute, there are a host of films and shows that draw me to treat them in their own unique and respective ways; in addition, there are universes within movies and games(i.e canons) which upon fortune would offer me the time and ability to create worlds and experiences, with the aim of treating them with admiration and care - on my own, this bends towards screenshots and mere canonical definition, rather than group oriented work(of which I'd be so fortuned). On the edge of our capacity and time is the host of literary subjects ripe for inquiry and derivation; as well are the greats and their own biographical treatment. Alongside these more constructive efforts are those with more relevance to me personally. On one side are a series of principles and prospects that illustrate our view and resolve of the future and its most suitable intention; as well are reflections of our past and inscribing of our own personal history. In addition is there a project that marks the world and nature as it is with respect to me. The aim of this is to give me more constance and appreciation through better seeing what we have as well as better displaying what there is that is freely ripe and accessible for fruitful taste, treatment and profit.
    <br>&emsp;To reiterate, the trunk of this stems from that root within writing. These efforts that I have explained build on top of this as formative and heartfelt interests. If these are what shoulder the torso of writing, then our fuller projects mark the head of our life. Foremost is our work within implicit operations -better known as the Theory of Value- and its illustration through Sums. Secondly is our treatment of Middle Earth and Lord of the Rings into a more steadily and evenly made tale that emphasizes the richness and wholesome joy found through Tolkien's original telling of the story and world. Lastly perhaps is Soundtracker; this merely explains our interest in musical scores and the goal of arranging them for a simple and improved experience, along with giving room to contribute our own creative additions -such as music vids or gentle treatments. Those three stand out to me as being the most grand and present.
    <br>&emsp;Our objective is to create a website bolted in the brand of Ryan Michael Green. Here, my aim is to portray each of these works and pieces along with giving a mark for other platforms to branch towards. In that case, a Twitter anthology will mark our strongest public effort; as well, will Medium, Linkedin and any other suitable sites to illustrate and promptly display our writing be significantly worthwhile. And that feels like the proper extent of our efforts and their formation into both creations and fitted interests. Simply, we are going to do our best and wish for nothing more: for we are grateful enough to be eligble towards and active within this lasting state of flourishing generosity, deliberation, kindness, treatment and care. All of which we will drill into the ground to show, not for more resources, but to plant our name in and allow it to give its strongest and truest expression. "That is, and will be, our righteous good and gold."
 </div>

 <div id="primary">
    I think that our most truthful and core being is unlimited when it comes to application and resolve. As I like to say, if we were in a dungeon we could reflect on the fact that our time is still set for the same as those as Kings; moreover, could I repent for the injustice that I had produced, or be grateful for what I still had and who I was if the injustice was served to me. This is a baseline for me personally.
    <br>&emsp;In the middle somewhere is someone who has a little place to live, the basics of food and leisure, and the sparse amount of work to simply fit this line, but nothing more. At that point there is no injustice, merely poor choices that prevented my prior actions to make better use of this freer time, or the unluck that no such opportunity drew me to make that way. "We are still by our own choosing and trajectory."
    <br>&emsp;As an ointment then would I say that if the growth you seek is hampered in a certain way, that you relish how much is already here by your very presence in and amongst the air. The clouds offer a mix of colors and size, the sky similarly; the moon, sun and stars spin forever on, even in the winter and its chilling cold. No matter the day there is something promising, even if we cannot at the moment see it. Then, there is all that we can do. There is no war in this country or most like it; even then, are those that do have conflicts not subject to their wares at every space in time. We are free and this entails we have a baseline of consideration and care. Furthermore, would I remove the need for vanity, for even though these more open tides allow us to correspondingly achieve, it is wrong when it comes to either of two ways: one is that the improvements we seek are unnecessary to achieve more freedom than we already have, and two, that in whichever state that we're in, can the bulk of our treatment be comparable and raised. On this latter I mean that our interest on the whole is to throw ourselves into what we see; this is why work is so gruesome as it is done so with reluctance and friction; moreso, can you admittedly remove such roughness through being grateful and becoming more adjusted; but as a point of prominence within a vessel of care, these things are simply not so: they are at best, responsibilities and demands in which we make more soothing and amiable, but never flourished with glee. Still, the leaves on the tree and the fruit from the buds need some bark to grow on, and as a whole one could not employ themselves into a gracious space that was paired with being rational, and not respect and equally indulge in the fact that these goods we have and seek, are born from and in requirement of the means that brought them here, and our similar adherence.
    <br>&emsp;The heart of this though are those sweeter kinds of a reward. Compared to the security and fullness that you get from doing your duties well, those things which draw your creativity and lightness of touch provide more means of trust and rigor into your heart -whereas the latter gives more stretch to your bones, and settles them in. The effort that we truly seek are those ones in which we offer ourselves for the sake of contribution. In the case of our tasks and roles, we are simply trying to finish something. Our treatment of the world, in contrast, can never blossom enough and rewards us for ever doing so. I would illustrate our painting of this portrait in that we are satisfied in drawing the curves and shades of our line, but equally are we pleased in seeing the figure come together as a whole. On one hand, it might strictly be nice to look at, or draw you to feel a ceratin way by its gravity and strength. As the makers though there is something for us, or at the very least who know enough to be able to see the innermost and connecting parts. In that case, it is the stance of one familiar enough to find an appreciation, that such individual things could come together into this whole, and set itself apart as a complete form through and by these particular lines and pieces. It is as if we can see the delicacy and touch that went into shaping and setting each color, shade and line. In other words, our abled eye can set back with a gaze that sees the whole for its entirety; but sifting through the sides are all the edges and places that bring all this together to form such union, whereby our delight and fulfillment is kindly pressed onto the time spent and seemingly produced into a unique portion. Therein, is it that small piece that makes it more than just a whole, for we see it only with our own gracious claim as a thing that is marbling our baser impression of the whole.
    <br>&emsp;The world thus, as I see it, is already smoldered and claimed when it comes to our viable treatment. Therefore do I suggest that we extract ourselves out of misery and dissent, and place our attention instead onto the priority setting of reverence, treatment, honor and care. "Doing so onto the workings of and development into the righteousness and revivity of either right or countering wrong, will give us an invincible claim, of which no dungeon or hell could protrude."
 </div>
 <div id="1842">
    The classic question in regards to creativity: whether your limits are in ability or within the possibility of leveraging it? In most ways for each, you could say more but this is simply effective. It should be noted that these concerns are best addressed as if one were asking advice; the question may be "what would you do in this day and age considering the following statements: I have a great deal of skill and products to show it, where should I go to bring them into the spotlight," or, "I wish to be creative and successful, but I am unsure if the former can even be met before any impression is profitably made." Personally, I would remove any concern for the second point; this is due to the fact that our original and generous efforts are enough for value to be made; in other words, the sharpness of our lines or productions that reflect the grandest and most popular aspects that you otherwise see during your days, is not the condition in which we must stake ourselves on -just in order to be in the arena. In that case, we will assume that we have value to bring; moreover, as we address the second point of its placement into the world, we can infer that as we come along to achieving that, our generative and or tributive efforts will follow with increases and certainty.
    <br>&emsp;Let's throw ourselves into the water a little. Pretend it's 1842 and you have equal interests of the present, only in those older days: what do you do? Well, the very limits of being able to cooperate and present would bend both our expectations and suitable resolve into ones that were very driven and initiated. Better said, if the means for you to be known is blocked by the very ability for anything to be simply seen at all, then the work required to do so naturally draws one who is interested to rigourously oblige. In our modern times we confuse this. We look at the vastness of social media and ease by which 'self publishing' can be achieved; for most of us though we are both short in making use of what that freedom truly offers, but similarly narrow in what we think is worthwhile to share. "It's as if someone said anyone can be known 'so start producing!'. Your oblige may be to throw yourself into the medium that is openly offered to you, emphasizing though the hanging fruit of it all instead of leveraging it to express more genuinely and thoroughly built creations."
    <br>&emsp;Going back, we can be clear that the aim of those in those lesser days are no more valid or less worthwhile than they are in these times of ability and fortune. The key difference is that being in the open requires a more humbled approach to your creativity. I would draw the example like this. If nothing is likely to be achieved for the medium is so closed off, then what you have to bring is not really that important. This is because the quality is not going to remove the nature of the restrictions, nor will the hustle and bustle to break through them or likely emphasize effort beyond that which gets you over the hurdles and past the fray. Our point rests on emergence then. This amounts to taking steps forward wherein progress is ultimately made; in effect, wrong steps will be made apparent and prompt calibration, as will good steps be noticed and reinforced. That is why in some ways those harsher times are more beneficial as the work itself bears little resistance and, thus, those who can push through the friction of their expression will naturally have something original to share upon breaking through to the other side. The present though sees us immediately able to step in and be seen, or at least it appears so initially. The demand though is that if the means to expression is so small, then we must pay attention to what we have to say. This rests on the notion that those with something genuine to share are the ones who wish to share it the most; therein will those in olden times who broke through the resistance have an accumulated set of creative efforts that had trailed behind their forward discipline. Without the need for that discipline though now, there is no stretch of time for our creations to progress and develop; instead, we jump in and offer the simplest thing. "I just don't see how this is worthwhile in a lasting sense: as if sharing something which you are doing so for the sake of sharing will stick around forever."
    <br>&emsp;Instead, we should use the free time we have to address the actual work or interests we have to share. Again, to reiterate that the aims of the past are equal to the present; the point from before is that through the previous difficulties of expression that the perseverance required to push through it would be accompanied with genuine work that, upon breaking through, is then able and worthwhile to be shared; this contrasts our present scenario wherein our head cant be down with the work developing behind us; in our case the work is here and ready to be shared. The principle though regarding aims is that living is achieved where it is done so the most. Those of the past who succeeded ended up having something worthwhile to share; in our case though the immediate offer is to share brief pictures, comments and gifs. This is fun by the sake of expression: it is not lasting or substantial though. Perhaps because it is not in any way significant; rather it is just a passive and or small jabble, a pastime if you will. Through the interest to be furthered in our living, we can address that aim as achieved when something warrantable of bringing forth and thus generating a great deal of expression is made, will hone us forth as a target, bearing itself from the root of our concern regarding what it is we have the most to say.
    <br>&emsp;The distinction, in closing, is that doing something abundant is what measures the goal of living. Currently, the openness does not effectively promote the achievement of this for the draw of it is too quick and immediate; and, again to reiterate, that those in the past had no such fortunes and thus had to take more time to be in the spotlight; consequently though, their efforts had more time to develop. In this day then we must simply assess what abundance we will create. Upon doing so we can administer it through the platforms and earn an amount of living equal to the greatness of our generous and formative time. That is to my knowledge all encompassing and complete.
 </div>
 <div id="ourbest">
    My writing is the best step I can take. For one, if I did it to the best of my ability, there would be no other thing which reflected better of me. Initially, this will allow for union between me and my parents along with any possible nearby friends. The hope is that if you have an accessible reference(or platform rather) then you can more successfully show what you got; consequently, we can achieve a better understanding and therein openness, or even draw someone in. This marks the natural way of our line wherein someone local to us becomes affiliated with our sort of effort. Following this, the extent of that locale increase, wherein those suitable for collaboration and friendship is more regional. This represents the aim at least.
    <br>&emsp;At the core we are writers and thinkers, the inner treatment of which reflects the effort within a personal standing. Outwardly though is their advantages in what you can locally show, as well as being able to present the works through openly accessible and appropriate platforms(such as Medium, LinkedIn or Twitter). This generally brings us out more and towards two comparable ends. For one, if being more outward and public draws you to be more sharp and accountable, then your investment in the work and care for it is increased: this marks the kind of metric that we want our steps to abide by. Secondly refers to this notion 'that putting yourself out into a medium which is highly active and elaborate is opportune for possible and quirky results. We don't know who could see or to what extent; the profit in that is a mix between the sharpness we enact under these expectations, the chance for separate work and opportunities, or the local wish and desire to find and work with a friend. That is an optimistic yet realistic view of our digital contributions.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, the question for those with this aim in mind, is what can they generously do the best? The repercussions which we are banking on is the plausibility that both our opportunities, fortunes and base foundation will improve; moreso, can we say that however ill fit we are to the line, that the path and bearing that it is on is one that will almost explicitly last forever. In that case we can be sure that the promise we see now will only concentrate in the likely prospects as well as what you would later expect to come. This, at least, is the mature and reverent case for consistency through the steps that one can take best: and doing so well bears the most favour when the content within the progress is reminiscent of the goal to subsequently proceed.
    <br>&emsp;Within this garment there are three stitches I can see. At the base sits our current writings and the arrangement that we mean to make of them; these have been collected for two years now, building off eachother; they need some sharpening and the usefully proper display to encourage this; moreso, are they set to be the things(in collections) that get put out there: as the tributive offerings from me. Now that I've mentioned this I can see that this is the primary line. The second thread is of our worldly conquest(in study that is) and the third of our project of implicit operations and Sums. These, for now, like our treatment of nature and insight into the many worlds of interest to me, will cultivate themselves privately. Worth noting, is that key former is set to do so with formative aims, whilst the latter two are for my own gains and enjoyment. Literature, in addition, will be added to Lectures and Sums -the emphasis being on its industrious expression and formation.
 </div>
 <div id="concessions">
    On the private end our aim is in establishing the pitch for further objectives ahead. Better said, for example, if our personal goal is in learning and teaching the foundations and inquiries of cosmology(etc.) then solidifying and arranging the terms and topics is how our cultivated and designing efforts are best to be. On the other hand is our literal effort of portraying the writing we have so far done. "It is the hardest thing you see, but I am fine and able to do it; that is the fact that being well off and true is generally a solo problem and pursuit; bringing it out then feels and seems both unsuitable and poorly received." Nevertheless, I see much hope and familiarity within our wish to proceed down this path. For one there is no short amount of admirable and useful insight, be it from books, people or ideas. Wrapping myself in and around these allows for the words and principles that I am seeped in to have a more appropriate and prominent display. This is because my wish to step forth is not aimed at acquiring the means of separate conquest given by impressions, profit and response; instead, I am only trying to live more. There is an opportunity to do so whilst we smoothen our need for responsibility. "The printing press has just been invented; some look at this and think 'wow, what an opportunity! we can make books now, valued ones due to this new machine, and therefore sell them for money(and a good amount at that)."They're all so excited to earn something in which the rewards could go towards somewhere else they wish to proceed. My feeling though is that whether the tool of use for your artistry and enjoyment is of a brush, a method of binding, a means for stitching or simply thinking clearer and well, that doing so richly and freely is what best marks the final line in which your heart dreams of proceeding.
    <br>&emsp;My point, is that however much there is to gain from putting my best foot forth, that no amount of progress and corresponding profit that's gained will rightfully suggest or permit that you stop. Put another way, my concern is foremost onto what I wish to and mean to do in the most wholesome and full sought way; this contrasts those intentions that are admittedly desired, but conceited to the possibility of developing advantages or fulfilling separate ambitions. "As they say, there is a right way to acquire wrong things; there is also a right way to approach experiencing the right things. And my single difficulty is in confidently and substantially saying what thing I wish to properly do."
    <br>&emsp;There is some thing I seek. Its range carries the rot within our bottom, wherein we wish for and expect grandiosity and excitement, to the top and its own active stake. There is no need to deny it; being honest instead will ultimately show you the way with respect to the natural and or rugged interiors which shoulder your way. If I were a child in an impoverished country there would be little that could be done to change that; my desires though, if they are well formed and rooted, will reflect your interests and needs within the given situation. Our spirits may be high wherein we see grand horizons and possibilities afar, or we may be ill tempered and wishing to simply leave the place were in. In neither case though is there any real composed and well standing result that was founded through a similar way. "Its as if we wish for things outside of our control, or otherwise have too much confidence that our own abilities will be able to surmount the requirements; we simply spend too much time dreaming and not enough time asking ourselves who we are and what we seek in our life right now."
    <br>&emsp;In my own case I have spent a great deal of time removing the false assumption that other people, places and things are centrally different, so that I may rest easier in place with the knowledge that each and all(and thus here) is the same. I've cleared this path for me, yet I still find myself strung along and restlessly enticed by the possibilities of adventure, glory, infamy and deliverance. I don't mean to do this; but I cannot strictly tell you why it is I mean to do what I currently am, or otherwise rather. The insight thats most useful here, is within our limits due to conceiting to making concessions, and allowances for indecent considerations. The point of the earlier notion was that your hopes and ambitions are sound and just when you respect the relevant mold; this accounts for your observations, intuition(for profit and adjustment), as well as self importance and steering desire. These are all what amount to me and are thus the elements and therein mold, which houses the foremost string of my aims and interests. Instead of removing responsibility from the picture and over emphasising the need 'to live well', we should do more when it comes to settling in and ordaining ourselves to more suitable ambitions -ones that better reflect our place and detainment. In that, we can iron out the edges that are present whilst strengthening those that are appropriate for improvement. In that way will our place sort itself into a more soothing and fertile lane, whereby our tuned following of it will bring us solidly to the ends that mark an aim born from the best within our present position.
 </div>

 <div id="showingup">
    For most of my life I have been patient with success. I knew for a great deal of time that it would naturally come, and my only place was to adhere to the tracks of the line; or, better said, that life would continue on, going forever with or without me: and my task was to keep up. As I have grown, that end for me has changed. Whereas before there was some image of deliverance and exploration, I see more personal studies of literature, and practice of stability and strength through the body -for both a means and pleasure itself. As well, do I look forward to games arriving, whilst I play the ones I have regularly enjoyed; in addition, are my love of movies and shows, along with personalities and peers. On top of this is a level of gregarity, in which I share what I have where I can, and in a way that reflects both the creativity and ability simply found in me. To that the world has become more immediate and round.
    <br>&emsp;For some reason though the thought of having some popcorn, or sitting in a theatre(and watching a whole movie in general), or staying up late seems to provide me with an underlying despair. Comparably, though different in that it seems reasonable to me, are the uses of sugar, for its draining effects, smoking weed, for its shortness of expectations and respect, as well, as of recent, the use of a blanket, wherein I choose to sleep without for the claim of a stronger rest. These latter have become, or are at least becoming more firm as important things for me to avoid. Those former though have no rational effect. "The scale of our principal wains." Part of me thinks that there is a reason for these concerns, but the other side of me says that they are addressing issues that aren't really notable. What I mean is that perfection and purity go along way towards being productive; however, if your image of what those efforts should be are stretched out and apprehensively placed, then the need for and strain onto excellence will prompt itself with haste. "It is that rush to be so that tolerates nothing short of the reverent step towards prudent consistency."
    <br>&emsp;And there are principles based at the heart of these concerns that are worth addressing. Our activity is best when it is appropriate for the day in time; too much have our stronger years seen us premature in our routine of training, wherein we'd be better off letting ourselves be more lightly active through the middling days as opposed to the rushed pursuit of rigor and strength. This is a useful insight. Despite that, my feeling is that the key lesson of the story is not to have sugar due to its debilitating effects when it comes to this scenario; paying attention to your state even if it is well is preferable, but to suggest that perfection is required is not explicitly required for favorable results to occur. In that, would I say that there is no rush to bring out our time. In fact, by edging ourselves to grown up rewards from paying attention, our actions will naturally and subsequently become more conducive to those more reasonable and heartfelt desires. Perhaps it has just not come together in a way that I can fully see.
    <br>&emsp;For me, Adulthood is coming whilst our childish years trail behind. To that, I see our death, yet all of our life beforehand treated to and sown together in what I wish to accomplish and receive, as well as what I hone myself in on and fortifty myself against -for I know what to generally expect. In that case, would the natural misfortunes and troubles of work and despair be worth our preparation and regard; moreso then, and to this I feel is what truly makes me a man, is I know both what I want to do and be, and, moreover, have I begun and moreso been developing the reverence, to appreciate that there is goodness in these steps ahead, to which the demand of me is placed on showing up with ablility and gratitude. To that, I say, that where we're going, whether unsure or known, is one where each step is one that I can both grasp and take; consequently, at the present place I'm now, am I confident and breathing, for I know by this fate and resolve that I will forever proceed.
 </div>
 <div id="whole">
    I think as a rule of thumb, that it would be helpful to state what you currently know. Herein, you can at least progress towards clarity of the fray with a better grasp of the knowledge you already have. Moreso, to note, should we reflect on the fact that our situation here within a limit suggests that our reverence for one kind of knowledge or the other is wrong, unless it sits inside the speculative model. Therein, would only the things that we can until this point profess bear any merit: for otherwise we have mistaken truth for things not yet inside reason’s domain.
    <br>&emsp;Foremost among these is the fact that when we die, there will be peace and tranquility. I know this because there is nothing besides this that fits the description. Admittedly, I am attributing my own position on the kindness of nothing. But we can at least say that we are surely headed for the latter, which I see no error in attributing the gain of serenity, as one would in their deepest and darkest sleep. “Where, if you awoke, there would not be much more than the fadedness of old memories and the ease of going back in.” Therefore, to be frank, there is quite little to fear in regards to our absolute gain. I mean not to say that our lineage of associative reverence bears nothing in terms of value or address, but we must consider that the bulk of it is wrong . “Or at any rate, its value is based on there being no sound alternative (or favorable on at that).”
    <br>&emsp;In addition, I would add that this is not because we have expanded our knowledge of what constitutes the law -or nature of things. In olden times we knew so little; moreover, were the most impressionable things were those of a disastrous nature. Thereby our impression of the world came from squeezing calamity through an unmitigated lens. The advances of modern science and physics however, merely show what is more accurately coming through the funnel.
    <div class="qu">Only thought though -regarding these sound findings- and our resolve into the frontiers of justice can bear us any closure and stake into what we should either refine or further look at, and therein what we could hope to achieve -and are right to otherwise expect</div>
    I would propose then that our stance moving forward be positioned with respect to two things. One, is that we should abide by the natural principle and remove ourselves from being so subject to things which are not stable or properly founded. “Doing so will remove any unneceesary friction from clarifying and amending to the otherwise (natural) truth).” Second, is that our possession of a more complete register, or accurate base of knowledge rather, is not either A) a sufficient demonstration of what it is we ought to do -as we have not thought about what these new facts mean, but merely gathered them- and B) a warrant for ever removing the needed inquiry regarding what those things should receive in terms of our treatment -as new evidence will likely be found, nor our thinking completed, or without room to grow that is.
    <div class="qu">Neither of these aspects have any merit in being one-sided. In both of their cases, the points that they have are merely reminiscent of a lack of judgement, as well as a boldness ‘that is too quick to at last claim a meaning of all’</div>
    Put another way, the law is reflected in the scope of things; to be more precise, the law in our case is that which nature wishes for us to do, to which our obligation would be justice. We mustn’t mistake the fullness of our investigation as an end to what we have to do, for despite the accuracy and breadth of the illustration, we will have still yet considered what it is we have to do. Or at any rate, what we see, how we feel, whether there is in fact more to say, or at least discover. “In other words, that regard for attesting to our treatment must be advanced through discursiveness, rather than planting our feet at the apprehension of being without a certain cause, or thinking even that upon knowing what said cause is, that our judgements (and according resolutions) are done.”
    <div class="qu">Science may bring us all, but are we not men who’d then use it?</div>
 </div>
 <div id="trust">
    We will die and that’s ok. Foremost, is this the case for the appreciation we have in the temporary side of living that constitutes the flip side of the story. Hereby, we’ll revere the fact that this gift of joy and activity was given; moreso, we’ll simply refer to this time as the living state of our being, upon which end we will enter a state of rest. “To peace then we will expect.”
    <br>&emsp;As for what we should do prior, this grounds itself through resolutions born from thoughtfulness. Let us say that mortality and its pleasing condition bears offers to how we should approach it. In that way, those efforts we consider will have an indifferent end by which they make, wherein the hope for such activities require nothing more than reaching that place through our strongest step; this occurs when the regard for where they are headed is not ill arranged, or banked outside the activity itself -and its actual claim of living. In other words, if we are living well, then this will be accountable by virtue of us being steadfast and clear onto our anticipated end. This is opposed to wishing for something other -which is in fact untrue- and placing our efforts towards there. Instead, we should bend ourselves to the proper mold depicted by the prior sentiment. “Which is that our end is coming, necessarily, but of rest and ease is all it will be: where we thus happily comply, in living to then with peace and ”
    <br>&emsp;Specifically though, since our time is not right outside of proper living, then we ought to propose what those appropriate actions are. For one, we don’t fully know. This is perhaps because our resolve to meet death peacefully is one based on a valid assumption. Despite our confidence, the end may not be as we take it, and the possibility for mistaking that renders our fundamental resolve at the most likely. Seeing as our actions have no strict measure, we can still uphold the reasonable bound within that wholesome limit. In that case, our interests pull the bill; moreso, does our formative treatment of them mark the height in which their attention can treat. However, it is worth noting that these inclinations that one may have -which in some way is what we are talking about- are really our innate tendencies and desires convening with candidates for relations. For example, we are able to see for the sake of vision and its utility within survival; if there is no danger then we may simply have the time and place to watch the sun set, or watch the moon rise. This sort of thing feels most relevant in our modern case. We all have industry along with inner wishes that only reason can temper; doing so though is paramount so that our constructive efforts -which bring lasting joy- dont falter at the beckoning of a stiff back or full stomach.
    <br>&emsp;And I dont truly mean to say that our actions should regard our time after death, for I do see much strength in believing that such end is simply indifferent and natural. Only, this does not proclaim we do anything other than what our innate proclivities and interests fair us to do. Which is indeed fine and worth being grateful for: but any limit in knowing this condition of ours to be true, does render a proper stance of doubt, for if the truth is indeed otherwise, then our actions should have those ends in mind. “Since, by tradition’s sake, those alternatives are quite harsh and high staked comparably, in their judgments.” Which in some sense, is why the naturally indifferent truth is more fine and preferred: as we are at most sentenced to be ourself.
 </div>
 <div id="fufillment">
    The world is just weird. Were full of excitement and a good amount of cheer, yet no great amount of agreement with this will stall the idol and aimless feeling that corresponds with being out of shape. What I mean is that if we have less comfort and respect for ourselves, then other people's hopes and dreams will poorly rub against us, as well as opportunities being seen as less promising: for we have no aim. I've noticed though that in becoming richer and settled that our own personal composition and steps are easily set within the standard 'of simply being me'. We need not acquire or arrange for achievement; instead, we can strictly focus on and wish for the objects of our effort, or the interest and industry into formative creation, to be our forward path and leading direction. This compares with our legacy'd intent, wherein self importance deemed our rewards to match the caliber of the work I meant to do. In that case though, the burden of these creative demands saw me more still than moving; moreso, did the hopes and dreams that these achievements sensibly offered feel more unrealistic and narrow.
    <br>&emsp;An important parallel is this notion of being a success based on virtue or environment. In my case I always sat towards the former, growing confident that the latter would become easier to address. This is no longer applicable. Instead, our efforts are meant to treat us to the best that being our best accords. Put another way, if I am strong and free, than it is my open and wholesome heart that is providing: the offer is joy though. In other words, my interests in a stale state are those of circumstance -of which my wishes oblige. In a sounder and richer state, my claims are set on living well in abundance. Since that amounts to being active, regularly, then my consideration for what lies ahead corresponds to the kind of that hopeful expectation; in that, my wish is to live, and therefore what I wish to receive. "When I consider and account for my circumstances, or the simple needs for that living to be grasped, they are as a whole deemed and happily seen as motions and paths with righteous and flourishing activities as the lead." It is enough for me then to resolve myself to be who I am in this sort of way. Novelties are fine, and interests of the aesthetic sort will surely be capitalized upon if our fortune provides. These are all positions though. And be it preferable or not, or even objectively favorable or less so, it is who I am between that marks the point in which I will forever proceed. Moreover, in a few words or less, 'is that thing I wish for to be regardless of the position, for it is rooted in and baked towards the generous creation I produce, with living actively and roundedly as our gain'. "And this needs no other."
    <br>&emsp;In short, there is nothing for us to concern ourselves with aside from the coals which permit our hoped for living. To that, I personally would say that being able to sit comfortably and firmly, is the simple gate -or rather the line of which will reflect those ripe and leaner rewards. It is worth noting however that when it comes to opportunities and administrative tasks, that your favor is rightly sought for. The point though is that your choices and command should be at the most employed as the ultimate value of these things suggested. For example, if someone provides the chance to earn a fair share of money by simply filling out some forms, or perhaps it is a promising result based on performing a simple task, then your eligible oblige is truly worth admitting. However, if it is a permanent stay within a role that would truly hold you back from being as you ideally wished to be, then the comparably higher profits( in a monetary sake) would not be genuinely permitted. Now, you could choose the latter case and suspend your hopes for the finer horizon ahead. Be reminded though that those dreams are not waiting for you to be more consistent and set, rather they will falter away with the remission of their being targeted. From here the readied and unadorned decision to do something at the cost of your purer aims detriment, will consequently see that the wish for that place is less valued -leaving you with the complacent care for indulgence instead.
    <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, we should be mindful of our choices so that our genuine desires are met, or at least sought towards more clearly -wherein our step towards will be firmer and aimed. The point is that the world has both the means for action and comfort. Excitement and frivolity surround the latter, whilst integrity and rest sit by the former. How you spend your time and what consequence you wish for your choices to make, is determined ultimately by which side you lean upon. My preference is to hold my self in the highest regard, and deal with all the infidelities I contain so that I may sit easier and partake in the fertile and enjoyable activities of study and craft. I am not remissed though to make a choice that will remove friction from this path. I am, however, unobliged and without care to commit myself to efforts of a path which promises more than this simple smoothing; in that way, an interest in a certain profession or trip would seem to be rewarding, but my steadfastness notes that the required effort is more than I can ideally afford to contribute; moreso, that the reward on offer is a mere luxury and or garnish to my otherwise industrious and principled work. In other words, I weigh the expenses of things in terms of whether or not I will be sufficiently able to sit and work from there. Careers, the splendor and wares of travel, the general cost of restless moving and purchasing things, are neither desired or congenial to me. "Only those things, in the harshest way, are compatible if they legitimately encourage or support my hopes and wishes to sit and study, rest and read, run and write in the all the time around, as well as the passive time of motion pictures and gaming leisure -along with the simple act of enjoying the creations of all our youtuber friends- and doing so in all of this entirety by the virtuous principles and stability that allows for us to achieve this direction and state, consistently and in abundance -and perhaps with a friend ."

 <div id="interests">
    I feel as though a grip on our home and country would give us much more breathing room in terms of what we hope to see, as well as what is worthwhile to deem necessary in our ambitions. It goes, perhaps, under the notion that all is very similar and in addition vast; in that way, our interest in action and treatment is fairly unlimited in what candidates are set for this kind of care and disposal. Moreover, would our regard for our place as ones offering treatment, be equally worthwhile to address. In our living state, we are fine if food and warmth are acquired. The details of these do admittedly change as the world around alters back from winter to fall: within this cycle though there is merely an adjustment, for we as the bearers of appropriation remain. Therein, can I speak on behalf of one who is invested in constructing new ideas and furthering our active involvement to things; in this way, I mean to merely step forth with this direction in mind. That being said, our relevant stretch of time is under a few weeks. Ranges will generally overlap, but being in the soon to be mid January will comparatively differ upon reaching the beginning of February. The issue remains though that our steps are merely towards a lasting direction. Our ability to proceed though, and the ease by which we administer so is what that changing environment effects.
    <br>&emsp;Still, we will be going the same way, differing only in the firmness and state of our step's quality. To that, I would assess our present as sufficient within fitness's case, as well as being quite ordained to the weather and living scenario. Food is good and quick to come by, along with the space around and its suitability for the necessary training. Our time though seems less driven beyond these things. Perhaps it is because this base is settling so things around are given less attention and care, but I've noticed that in lacking so, the inner developments are receiving less of a pull to more quickly establish and proceed. Again, I don't mean to say that those things which a firmer setting would provide are worth rushing towards, at the expense of the foundations. It's worth noting though that in forgoing the disclosure of what those offered goods are, does our progression in becoming more constitutionally sound waiver a little, as it has less sight on what would amount to being sufficient.
    <br>&emsp;In other words, if we were able to do the things that we wanted regularly and reliably, then the means that got us there would be considered sound. However, if we in fact reached that state but knew not that it was what was desired -and in effect the point we had previously set to reach- then we may not settle and act as though we are still trying to advance. And that is fine for the most part. I would remark though that in those developing states that one may have less strictness in their prudence and less appreciation or care for the creative demands that their direction seeks. In this way our lack of awareness that our goal has been met will not see us adapt to being successful -which, compared to development, is a more immediate and rightly compulsive scenario, whereas the latter is generally more passive and waiting.
    <br>&emsp;To be personal and precise, there is much hope and value in laying out viable Tv shows and films as well as games -whilst accounting for the ones your presently in. Books are similar in expectations and current reflection. Moreso, are simple descriptions of the ideas or objectives within nature, prospects, Sums, truth, biographies(of yours too) and our personal training, quick and worthwhile to do. In this way, will our present be more substantial and knitted, as well as providing means to future instances or cares to be similarly addressed and elaborated upon.
 </div>
 <div id="creation">
    Im looking to write a book called The Architect. Its main aim is to share the reasons for being formative and pure for the sake of achieving a well founded joy and reflected happiness. The meat on the bones though is troubling me. Foremost is the fact that the things I wish to include are not immediately relevant to describing that claim. The history of the world, philosophy and theology, fitness and our past, along with our hallmark use of the method within the implicit nature of sums, are together set as marks I hope to mention down this path: yet the end of the route is not evidently supported by these.
    <br>&emsp;A reiteration is likely important. That is the fact that I only mean to share. These things and the format that house them are personally of interest to me by virtue of construction and tribute. Offering the creation to others is merely an extension of how I am invested in the work in that their possible attention and care will further my accountability and resolve to be generous -wherein I live more. An idea is from one and for all. There are questions of absolute ontology, the firmness of natural existence and the reason for the implicit function of sums, that pull me forward on a quest to decipher. Moreso then, if everyone had already listened and given me a godly reward, those concerns would remain. Consequently, I will no matter my fortune proceed -for the action of doing is willfully provided.
    <br>&emsp;What I mean from this is that my interest in sharing my creation is simply a measure of what the developments mean to me. If other people care about the issue and its success, then our attempt to reach them will be ever more enriching. Again, the point, or the heart of it rather, is in the unknown's inquisition. On my own I would do this, and as that is my current state, it is what I will proceed to do. I wish for more though in the sense that my wish for these things is merely a mark for what suitably draws my innermost desire to contribute. The inclusion of other people heightens this value and consequently draws me to offer even more. Within the range of my isolated interest to the opposing side of total communal devotion, the line and mechanism of being is fully complete. It is worth noting that this path is a creative one, as if I were a painter trying to finish a portrait through my skill and craft whilst everyone around supported me and cheered -with each of us caring about the progress towards its completion. This initially seemed in contrast to the worship of a deity within religion, however I noticed that they are very much the same. The real distinction is that within a creative field you can be the god. This is because your creation is drawing other's interests, a position which you could find yourself (cheering) in to. That is actually a strong marker for 'from me to all of whom I see', as I am giving and feeling more as people attest to my effort, but am similarly provided with an equal place to attest to their own.
 </div>
 <div id="prospects">
    "When I see you standing there I grit my teeth, for I know what is coming, the fortune of which bears me to be consistent -as the slight work required despite being increasingly rewarding, is still demanding the same." That notion of having to work forever is troubling. On one end if we knew, or at least suspected that our role would soon end, then the current task of it would drag me little. What I find most concerning is the remission this would remedy; the consequence being that we would live as if we were more free: for the future held no miserable end, and thus had no claim of our present apprehension. To my point, the actions and aims that followed from these open lanes reflect those things which you truly seek. What I wonder though is whether or not their metric is worth any less in a potentially troubled position. What would the promise of removing stress be earned from anyway, and earn you any more than what could be done in a narrowed place? Would those offerings not be from objectives in any case? "What goal could we not truly advance towards, of one that brought us joy that is, regardless of position?" My feeling is yes, yet our inquiry sees a mistake in seeing this acquisition as the greater claim. It may be that a situation that has more to offer will make you better off - thus justifying the anticipation from its offer. What I would propose though, is that we consider the nature of any situation, and whether or not there is a limit to what can cause distress; or in other words, is there any likelihood that more trouble and need of promise will follow, regardless of what you've so far claimed. "The pieces I am trying to link are that of this desire for remedying our position, put against and with supposition to the accompanying resolve to use the time diligently -as if you were free already."
    <br>&emsp;It feels like the harmony of our fortunes and the life we are living would be contrary to one another if their suitability was out of order. Put another way, if being well off truly meant what it'd mean, then would living well not be equally promised? My suspicion is that the means to living well are rooted in deliberation and its following action. The course of this is not removed or dampened as an ideal within any case or fortune. What it really suggests, is that even if times were poor, then we would still be better off in solidifying our aims. Even if we could not act upon them, our situation would only be limiting us in bringing out the way -not the fact that we have one. The issue arises that even if our time is well, that forging the way for living prosperously is in no shorter demand. From my inspection, I believe the strength of our criticism is in forgetting this point during our ambitions to improve our position: when the means to living well through deliberation is not given any meaningful regard, then the attempt to be better off will not treat you to anything more that being well, rather than living: and is the latter not what we truly seek? Is the shortcomings of it not the root of our feeling discontent -wherein our position is declared as poor and misfortuned?
 </div>
 <div id="eastroad">
    As it were, we grew up near the Fraser Valley. As I grew older the interests I had did not specialize when it came to places and scenery, but the aim of Vancouver was at the forefront; at least the east was where I'd come from, while the west and the sunset is where I bore towards and strived. Now though, I am living near those ends. To the quality and condition I will not speak, but to the east road, that is where my care is placed. From our point near Main and Langara, the land is opportune for all sorts of findings. Down the hill there sits southern views, and moreso is Garden Centre a mere train ride away. Up north and into the woodland sits Granville and its mighty homes and trees; further west from that sits the flats of Arbutus; even further west sits the provincial forests and UBC.
    <br>&emsp;To the east though there sits a stretch of residents, and the means for views one seldom sees. Through the brief brush and past memorial sits Kensington park. Perched atop the peak of Knight Street, the steps here are prime for views of the north -and to all that offers, Kensington will be your treat. After this though the land is dead. The scope is still there but the slopes are uneven, blocking any strict and definite claim. Busing to the border of Burnaby, or trekking there at least, you'll reach the southern tip of Grandview; or rather, the mount of Renfrew and all her delights. Generally, this direction has two points after a divergence at the line of Kensington: make clear cut through the alleys and lanes till you reach Killarney, resting there before you head towards Maywood and Central Park, or, if you're going directly through Kensington, make for the split of Kingsway and Nanaimo, and pass through the bustle till you reach Slocan park. Once here, you can split off down towards Beaconsfield and John Henry park, or you can keep course alongside the south point of Renfrew Ravine until you hit Windemere. From this point, you can go one of two ways: turn south slightly and head towards the Marvelous Graham Bruce elementary, wherein your course is back to Collingwood for a return home or further eastern travel, or on the other hand, you can bank north towards the top of Fallaise at Renfrew Heights and see the marvel there, furthering into the top of Canada Way near Boundry and Cascade. "If your aim is Citedale(in north Burnaby) and the slopes around, then heading down to Rupert station will get you quickly to Brentwood. If you mean to go infront of BCIT and up to Royal Oak, then keep to Canada Way and pass through Broadview Park."
    <br>&emsp;Altogether, your midpoints of the East Road are Graham Bruce on 28th and Boundry, Metrotown and or Central Park, or the heights or Renfrew (or the Christian School shortly down). From here, as said, you may look for Northern Burnaby and Citedale Heights, or, more likely, further east towards Robert Burnaby and New West Minister. As it were, if you mean to go through Broadview and towards BCIT, then note that the Canada Way bus can always take you from any point until Royal Oak - whereby you can dismount and head up towards Metrotown (and Marlborough) - or continue to the east side of Deer Field Park or the top west side of Robert Burnaby near Lakeview Elementary. Note that once you pass Royal Oak, the land becomes very steep through Buckingham Heights; if you mean to go to Robert Burnaby or further into New West, then the Canada Way should be kept to. Unless you mean to circle back through Deer Field, there is nowhere but up to go. If your point was Graham Bruce, you can keep on foot down Praire and into the east side of Deer Field, banking up towards Metrotown, or continuing east through the park; otherwise, you can keep higher up and go through Inman Elementary, reaching Marlborough near Royal Oak. If your wish is to keep east from this line, then keeping down Oakland Street will take you along the mid slopes of Buckingham; turning up the hill will quickly take you to Kisbey, or further on you can turn up Walker -or the many streets that will take you south and up the hill- to reach Edmunds Park and its forest lane. Another option from Graham Bruce is taking a brief walk south to Collingwood to take the Expo to your further destination. In a similar way, if your point is near Central Park, you may head for the Expo if your aims are more eastern, or you can keep further south and head across the banks of Southern Burnaby -whose views of the land are uniquely wide and open.
    <br>&emsp;Whether you are trekking there through the Expo, or reaching it from Deer Field and or Marlborough, or the south strip of Burnaby, Edmunds marks the center for your eastern gain. Rounded against the flat top of Buckingham to the north, and west of the slopes of New West and Glenbrooke, Edmunds is the switch off point for those traveling eastwards. If you have come from the north, then Edmunds will transition towards New West; or if you've come from the west, by foot or train, Edmunds will shoulder your bend down and towards Robert Burnaby or the lane beyond. In this area, the land is sloped south. Before the steep side onto downtown New West, there is the neighborhood of Glenbrook, with its many highrises and parks around -including Queen Elizabeth. Up on the north side of the slope runs 10th Ave. From here and the roads above, the way is carved east towards the edge of New West and the valley beyond. Once you pass Canada Way and Cumberland, the north becomes blocked by the forests covering the nearby peak; instead, the east opens up and you can see the lands near your older home. At the end sits Cariboo Park, whose side and view are open and wide. "Compared to wonders of Graham Bruce, the immediacy of Golden Ears and Maple Ridge seems relatively less distant, as if we were close." This spot marks the end of our territory and sets the beginning of that which used to bear our home. The way home is a short stroll down the hill to the Expo line. Otherwise, the sundering hill of Cariboo holds no limit for what you can see, and how long. That is the Great East Road.
 </div>
 <div id="renfrew">
    As a quick note, this area is interesting for its military based naming within the local neighborhood. The standouts are Normandy Street, Dieppe, Vimmy and Malta. Anyways, these streets actually mark the slope of the Renfrew area. At its foot runs Grandview highway, beginning at Boundry and ending near Commerical. At the bottom sits Falaise Park; here, she runs up at three different levels, each offering a great view of the Lions from the east. At the top there is the Vancouver Christian school, which holds a stretch of field with a strong amount of scenery and scope. Even higher sits the peek of Renfrew Heights: here, there spans a plot of grass with a view of Downtown sharp and kind.
    <br>&emsp;On the back of this runs Boundary Road. From the south to the north, this marks the border between Vancouver and Burnaby. Settled right beside Renfrew Heights is Cascade. This little neighborhood holds the general hospital, a marvel up the road, and the end of Canada Way -where I lived for a short while, some time ago. That marvel is from Graham Bruce Elementary. The reason for its prowess is in the slight slope it has over the surrounding lands; other than a separate viewpoint nearby in Burnaby, this place is the only way to see the east with clarity. "And seeing Golden Ears rooted in the distance, what a seldom treat!" I remember waking up one morning to go west, but coming south initially. It was early and the blue had just begun to mix with the red, making the sky slightly burnt as the darkness receded. There were no strict clouds in the sky, only mere wisps which caught the burning light. Going up Boundry I rested at Graham for the first time, peering far off to the lands I once called home, and relishing the fact that Golden ears could be seen. "That is a marvel, as it offers the good only found in its position. Garden Center in Richmond, Moberlay in South Van and Marlborough foremost near Metrotown, are equal members of that group."
    <br>&emsp;A quick mention of that little area which I lived -up the road from Graham Bruce. I did so for a short few months during the summer of 2021. Notably, a forest ran down the street from me. It had a little park and a little field, though the views were not significant. Moreso however, was a little wooded path that rain cleanly through the brush. Coming to the west, it came out in line with my house up the street, but opened into an abandoned clearing near the start of Boundary and Grandview. "I came here and sat often, gazing onto the northern mountains, treated to the Lions especially." Having moved home afterwards, this feeling was not lost; having moved back to Vancouver but in a more sheltered and wooded setting, has me missing those peaks and scenery."
    <br>&emsp;To wrap up I'll mention some points of interest nearby -and outside any particular area. Three that come to mind are Renfrew Park further down Grandview -which had a pool, library, fair views and a rustic ravine. Windemere - which sat nearby but up higher- and its vast northern views, along with the size of the fields which offered them. Then John Henry park, which was more like a complex full of trees, many fields and a lake inside. A quick addition is a personal favorite called Beaconsfield. Settled neatly between Renfrew and John Henry, this park has two soccer fields stacked on top of one another, making one long stretch of grass; as well, there are a few openings where the Lions can be seen. As a place then, with the high school track down the street, makes this spot at the very least useful. Considering that it is not too far down the street from Superstore, makes it a more promising locale -at least when it comes to ones that are settled far away.

    Seneca mentions, briefly, the philsopher Brutus, who mentions the request of crowds and their plea for Gladiators to accept tbeir deaths, willingly. "They throw their arms in errupt if one is to beg or run away," he says, "They want all to stand, with ferocity, accepting their path to try and fight." They are hear for entertainment after all ; running aside tempers the mood when all who've arrived did so, only, to see the spectacle ; cowards pin the excitment.
    <br>&emsp;The mention here from Brutus has Seneca playing his pithy, yet welcomed ways. He makes suggestions, aimed at those given such request, that if your place is death in the ring, or anywhere else, he states, for the matter, that offering your throat, literally, or not and with grace elsewhere, gives freedom over fortunes pull, by winds or the crowd.
    <br>&emsp;This sentiment is quite personal to me. In my younger years I struggled grealty with grusome fear and violence, scared at least, like a prick in my side, by the depcitions at least. My response was always to deny the existence of such reality. From that position I still hold, only, now, there is no fight ; I have already won. In that place of deciet and pillagry, true or not, my case is made by the claim I have on my stake, from offering my throat, freedom is gained. Fear, thus, has no make ; Victory has her gain. What I enjoy the most is being the banker, holding her profits. "The best friendship is one where you share the profits. I feel best then, with Victory as an ally and, beating fear earns all worth in triumph."

 <div id="firstprinciple">
    Our first principle shares the heart of Descarte's example(to speak of one), where he claims that he exists due to his thinking. This notion reflects a maxime, or rather a fundamental point which other proposals work from. In our case we will address the fact that our thinking is the most prominent feature of ourselves; moreso, does it's place feel the furthest when placed within inquiries or consideration. As actions, these reflect the kind of path which we'll take moving forward; as a baseline though, our first principle is revealed. Through thought, we can assess what the foremost meaning of our thinking is: and that is simply the fact that we are limited. In short, if one is absolute, then they are greater than all things which are less so. For the sake of being explicit, will we regard our need and very ability to inquire as a sign of our shortcoming, wherein our otherwise place above would require no thought or consideration - where it's would be acceptably absent. Since we are present to it, we are therefore below that greatest place: and as a position that holds such limits, our resolve should root itself with respect to that way. In technical terms, this is our ontology; what it means however, or rather what it is that it suggests we do, is marked in the essence of how we came to know. As one of thought, and our assessment that this is all we can at the utmost be, marks our furthest and greatest claim as one within actions of a similar kind. "As thinkers, our thought is our highest way. The nature of this is then built upon things appropriate to its kind: logic, probability, analysis, consideration etc. Since these mental aspects are the greens of our essence, then the highest mark and measure that is relevant to us will be within these kinds." What that is reflects the limit, wherein the reach of our being as thinkers was less than all: and we at most could know that. Seeing as this most rooted claim is born of thoughtful action,than would the imperative to act on it, or in other words respect the finding, not be of a similar sort? Put another way, does our reflective being suggest what our resolute and objective way should be?
    <br>&emsp;I did not mean to elaborate on this much further than the mention of first principles and ontology; and I don't mean to continue. As much as this sentiment is worthwhile though, there is still much more to say. Objectively, determining a first principle offers you the means for a sound and able philosophy. That this itself is valued I cannot say. However, what it entails we can at least describe - and therefore elaborate on what it contains, and how it may be desirable. Having a philosophy that has roots in this well founded sense, gives way to two main things: Theology and Ethics. To the former, this remarks the notion of how things will end; in our case, our limit merely suggests that ours will be peaceful and free. Moreso then, to the latter, will this sound casing of a principle and its end, give way for a proper resolve, as our actions are set within fuller frame - the adherence and demonstration of which constitutes ethics. Objectively then, will our aims of living well and reaching success, have a firmer and solid foundation to build from. This is, foremost, because onto those things which we mean to work on, as well as the desires and interests we seek and wish to obtain, will have a sharper measure as to judge their value and place. Consequently, when it comes to being mature and reasonable, will our actions sprout from and bend towards the congruence of that - the gain of which will be the sound and true victory we seek.

 <div id="clearpairs">
    Rationality describes one’s state within their resolve to reason. Reason, reflects the interpretation of the world through a lens that rewards the user with an experience better set to the laws of nature, the alignment of which results in true justice. In other words, reason is what discerns the mold for proper action. Friendship then marks the companionship of those who would share their quest to be so well ordained. The reasoning of either may differ (though slightly, I reckon), but each other’s reverence and resolution to be as good as their inspection relies, bears encouragement from both sides. “As they say then, a friend is one who will tell you when you are falling short within your reason; or, they reassure you that rationality is the right way to be when your mind is struggling or with doubt; as well, if you succeed appropriately, then they congratulate you and confirm the soundness of your success, and fairly mention when not.” Someone who boasts you up for being irregular and frivolous is no real friend. Even though they may be a companion of sort, it is only within a sort of reason that any trajectory has any stay or merit; therefore, a lack of meaningful resolution is unsuitable for any decent collaboration. Put another way, if a thief has a friend, then their support is to one another’s place in the bottom.
    <br>&emsp;Individually then, our place will be best when it is set where it ought to be within that allied fashion: but the tying factor should be elements derived from reason. Seeing as the requirements are rooted in the merits of supporting each other in working towards such(appropriate) reasonability, then we could illustrate this otherwise by saying ‘that what is good is what should be sought as one, and thus with another’. In other words, if a friendship is truly the greatest thing, it is because it purports and nourishes the progress and sustenance towards goodness and (fair) contribution.  The mark of this then, as the measure of what is good together, will similarly stain the clothes of one who is embellished and administered through actions on their own. “Alone then may we pleasantly travel.” For, if a wandering passer-by comes near our way, we will have a proper scale to assess whether they are suitable to join us; moreso we can be sociably kind if our own aims are well ingrained and furnished: for we will be both satisfied with our own place and direction, and be therefore more able and willing to help the stranger reach for their own particular ways and interest. “And at any rate have the means for proper judgment, so that their poor aims -and according scale- don’t become our own.”
 </div>
 <div id="intothefray">
    They say that the toughest job of the gods was in creating the mold for justice. In other words, as Plutarch says, ‘instilling the framework for proper action was the foremost thing that the workmen of reality had to consider in their construction’. The question that is most personal to me though, or thing that I would foremost remark, is that in terms of that construction, I am blind as to what they mean for me to do. One side I am clear on though is what this alignment would bring; rather, I know that the right reward is one of genuine rest and joy. “Or better said, despite my ignorance of what nature is and what she wishes me to do, I do know what would qualify a result as being fitting; for I at the very least know it would be positive; and at any rate, in considering how certain members have proper resolves fitting for them, so am I sure that whatever such fine actions were for men, that doing so would yield the qualities of constance, flavor and ease. In that I am sure.” 
    <br>&emsp;Despite this, our assessment of the law (or nature) and our proper oblige towards it, fairs some trouble.  This is not so due to any limits in assessment, or any fair ones at that, but our judgment rather. For example, there are two games, each with their own rules. One group of people plays one and another plays the other; within each side those involved respect and adhere to the rules and are, for the sake of argument, just. The question though, is who (or what rather) determines whether you should play this or that game? Some may conclude that any action, or rule for that matter, is set for congruence, and thus the measure of our time is not what we choose, rather that we would bring ourselves well in whatever we do. I would raise the concern then that murdering folks may have a better way of doing it. I would expand upon this though by saying that our pretension of what murder is rests inside an assortment of other interactions that must equally be accounted for -so we can dismiss that for the moment. This sentiment can be iterated on until you reach the entirety of things which must be accounted for in order to be all encompassingly proper. “That is, without an ultimate rule, or at least understanding of how all things are, then any truth in what you actually should do is limited.”
    <br>&emsp;In any case, you have two choices: address the whole in all its workings, however limited, and make yourself towards that, or suspend your belief that all can be known and accounted for and instead be simply resolved within your principled spirit. On the latter, in other words, we may accept that we are not going to know why being philanthropic or collaborative is truly good or not, but can then fairly and plainly bring a centering attitude of kindness and humility into whatever comes our way. “Which is itself a sound assumption, albeit one still.” 
    <div class="qu">Being just means properly following the law; the law though in a strict sense can expand further than our common grounds can see -even through the strongest lens- and being able to address what it needs is consequently hard. On the other side, is a more open yet incomplete approach (within a strict measure), whereby you make a lesser address of the law and simply be who you are best at being. Again, if your nature and or behavior has you partaking in the acts of a serial killer, this may not be the best of you. And we could say conversely that someone who is naturally accepting and expressive towards gregarity and maturity, holds an obviously preferred measure. “But so are we merely tending our time, as opposed to bending it towards some truth”</div>
    The question then, is how can we say that something is right or wrong if the overall law is not fully understood? Perhaps the recognition of each side necessitates a developing process wherein we accept who we are as terrestrial beings with the capacity to reflect, but lack (for the moment) the entire picture. Personally, I recommend that we stake ourselves on the point that got us here in both the acceptance we made of our limitations, along with the humble resolve to move forth into the fray as we deem fit: whereby theft and perjury were seen as poor, for nothing more than the contrary pull against the goods of what’s plain and common. The point we will have reached then will be one administered for the sake of what’s clear, rather then well known -as the latter had been decidedly limited. Our progress then -per the term- would bring us but closer through the fray. “Whereby we accepted our place within it, merely advancing.”  It seems most fitting then for our response (to nature and her ways) to be as ones of likeness and strength, rather than misrepresenting our place as if we had discovered the law, or whats true -which, to our point, lies incomplete.
 </div>
 <div id="discipline">
    Something must be addressed for the sake of naming our limit. That, is the sentiment that goodness and our reverence towards it, reflects a congruence towards the way things are; whether the good is more in line with our resolve or within the accuracy of the aim itself, we can say that the need is for a mix of the two. The problem though wherein our limit falls is what is actually the right thing to do. They say that being just is when the actor is in line with the law; moreover, would we say they are principled when their actions are ingrained and adorned to this proper way, as opposed to our efforts being reminiscent of what is inbred and innate. Now, akin to the Dialectic will our assessment of reality and the law it proposes be a continuous one. Perhaps this is ultimately true so long as that prior notion of being bestial is true; in that case we would say that our place in the world as men is one where those irrational sides of ourselves are mended, and instead we bend towards reason and rationality -rather, our actions being staked towards the findings from reason. That is the way I suppose. We are those with the ability to sense and care, but this is built from a lineage of weariness and irresolve. Our actions then seem principally necessary to be encased within the discipline of being attentive and considerate so that we may more accurately see the world. Therein, will our actions that follow, from rationality, be more adapt to the way things truly are.
    <br>&emsp;Therefore, my resolution is to fall back onto reason; furthermore, will our place as actioned beings see us kneel to such findings and compliantly respond. This will illustrate the point. As old men or monkeys, we acted upon the dangers we supposed because our senses suggested them. That a lion or tiger was infront of us is no flawed worry and is fairly just if the response is to run. When there is an earthquake though and our inability to discern the cause is overwhelming, then believing that we are being set out upon by something either maniacal, or someone good who is reflecting mere disappointment -and a therein corresponding need to be cherished- is both foolish, nieve, ill composed and, to the former, psychotic. The point I mean to draw though is that our actions were not there because these particular kinds of impressions and prompts were uniquely innervating; rather, I suggest that it is our nature as beings who act upon the insight and or happenings of the world and, therein, respond because that is what we are made to do. If you can follow this, then I would propose that our formative and preventative efforts are best when cased in reason, for their basis will be on a truth born from deliberation and thoughtfulness, compared to those which are of an impulsive and ignorant manner. Herein, could we say, in summary, that if our actions are going to be at all, and will serve us towards what we believe is just, than that accuracy of reason will give the inevitable running bull a clearer lane(so to speak). Concerning us then, will this result in our evident efforts having a more promising and profitable target. In other words, we, as our being suggests, will make for something in any case: the use of and aim of reason, is to set that way through the sensible confinement of our minds onto the world.
    <br>&emsp;Let us distinguish the difference between reason and rationale. The former reflects one's action to uncover and define the world and its way. "It is through reason that we discover and refine our view of the law more accurately." In contrast, our primitive assessment would define the world on the basis of impulse and ignorance, whereas reason seeks to explore and elaborate upon the workings of things around us from a deliberate and thought out way. Secondly then, to the latter, we can say that our rationale is our reason for doing something, as it seemingly pruports the law. In other words, the rationale for having a strong offense is that it allows for both the increased opportunity of scoring as well as providing an effective means for defense. The rationale though in doing this is reflective of our aim to score, as our assessment showed that the point of the game was to do so; how we amend to this task is where our actions are aligned as to be congruent to the aim (laid by reason) and thus given a rationale towards it. "That this will be effective considering what I mean to achieve." The rationale for doing the many things that amount to living however is unclear in a strict way. This is because our reason for living is ultimately ill defined. We do have ideas, but they are at best sown together and given a color that rewards us for being amended to them, though only enough so that we may earn what it is as inquiries seek, along with being able to further our definition. The issue though, as is in some way the case of dialectic, is whether or not the aim should be to continue to cycle, or reach the case where 'the' answer is known. I suspect that even if there were an absolute answer, our actionable status would interact with the results from our resolve and therein find more to consider. This is all a very difficult thing to do.
 </div>
 <div id="farshores">
    We will die and that’s ok. Foremost, is this the case for the appreciation we have in the temporary side of living that constitutes the flip side of the story. Hereby, we’ll revere the fact that this gift of joy and activity was given; moreso, we’ll simply refer to this time as the living state of our being, upon which end we will enter a state of rest. “To peace then we will expect.”
    <br>&emsp;As for what we should do prior, this grounds itself through resolutions born from thoughtfulness. Let us say that mortality and its pleasing condition bears offers to how we should approach it. In that way, those efforts we consider will have an indifferent end by which they make, wherein the hope for such activities require nothing more than reaching that place through our strongest step; this occurs when the regard for where they are headed is not ill arranged, or banked outside the activity itself -and its actual claim of living. In other words, if we are living well, then this will be accountable by virtue of us being steadfast and clear onto our anticipated end. This is opposed to wishing for something other -which is in fact untrue- and placing our efforts towards there. Instead, we should bend ourselves to the proper mold depicted by the prior sentiment. “Which is that our end is coming, necessarily, but of rest and ease is all it will be: where we thus happily comply, in living to then with peace and ”
    <br>&emsp;Specifically though, since our time is not right outside of proper living, then we ought to propose what those appropriate actions are. For one, we don’t fully know. This is perhaps because our resolve to meet death peacefully is one based on a valid assumption. Despite our confidence, the end may not be as we take it, and the possibility for mistaking that renders our fundamental resolve at the most likely. Seeing as our actions have no strict measure, we can still uphold the reasonable bound within that wholesome limit. In that case, our interests pull the bill; moreso, does our formative treatment of them mark the height in which their attention can treat. However, it is worth noting that these inclinations that one may have -which in some way is what we are talking about- are really our innate tendencies and desires convening with candidates for relations. For example, we are able to see for the sake of vision and its utility within survival; if there is no danger then we may simply have the time and place to watch the sun set, or watch the moon rise. This sort of thing feels most relevant in our modern case. We all have industry along with inner wishes that only reason can temper; doing so though is paramount so that our constructive efforts -which bring lasting joy- dont falter at the beckoning of a stiff back or full stomach.
    <br>&emsp;And I dont truly mean to say that our actions should regard our time after death, for I do see much strength in believing that such end is simply indifferent and natural. Only, this does not proclaim we do anything other than what our innate proclivities and interests fair us to do. Which is indeed fine and worth being grateful for: but any limit in knowing this condition of ours to be true, does render a proper stance of doubt, for if the truth is indeed otherwise, then our actions should have those ends in mind. “Since, by tradition’s sake, those alternatives are quite harsh and high staked comparably, in their judgments.” Which in some sense, is why the naturally indifferent truth is more fine and preferred: as we are at most sentenced to be ourself.
 </div>
 <div id="sweetends">
    I think that our most truthful and core being is unlimited when it comes to application and resolve. As I like to say, if we were in a dungeon we could still reflect on the fact that our ends were the same as those of kings or any freeman at least. Moreover, could I repent for the injustice that I had produced, or be grateful for what I still had and who I was if the injustice was served to me. This is a baseline for me personally.
    <br>&emsp;In the middle somewhere is someone who has a little place to live, the basics of food and leisure, and the sparse amount of work to simply fit this line, but nothing more. At that point there is no injustice, merely poor choices (and perhaps disposition) that muddied our natural paces away from more lucrative lines. In any case, if your plain living has you drawn to far-off fortunes or the mere remedies of excitement, I would advise that you relish how much is already available by your very presence in and wherever you are.  From the freedom to exist in your country -unlike those kept in a cell- you are can rejoice in all that dangles in and amongst the air. The clouds offer a mix of colors and size, the sky similarly; the moon, sun and stars spin forever on, even in the winter and its chilling cold. No matter the day there is something promising, even if we cannot at the moment see it: but we can be sure that the extent of our liberty reaches there, in promise at least. And beyond these tender basics there are still opportunities that you can pursue, be it of profession, trade or craft. Your lands are without war and unbridled crime, nor is there mischief and despotic rule in any civil sense. “More than those gifts of nature’s treats and your license to experience them, so can you expand your time and effects into the rural world, none are stopping you: your talents and attire are openly set. And whether you can or not, it is not due to what is hindering you; at least if there is some of that, blame nature and her principle conditions, but not the laws and conduct of man. Any shortcomings there are due to you not being one yourself.”      
    <div class="qu"></div>We are free and this entails we have a baseline of consideration and care 
    Regarding the quality of our free time, or of those things which mark our liberty, our interest on the whole is to throw ourselves in and fully engage. This is why labors (and comparable kinds of work) are so gruesome as they are done so with reluctance and friction. And although some roughness can be removed through personal adjustment and gratitude for what said actions bring, there is still at most an increase in smoothness and amiability, but nothing which compares to those liberal activies -and their saturation of flourishing glee. Still, the leaves on the tree and the fruit from the buds need some bark to grow on; and as a whole one could not employ themselves into a gracious space that was paired with being rational and free, and not respect and equally indulge in the fact that these goods we have and seek are born from and in requirement of the means that brought them there. 
    <div class="qu"></div>Such responsibilities and demands mark our civil agreement, whereby we participate in the world to earn us the basic things we need, and then enjoy our freedom to indulge in the fruits and treats we seek
    The heart of this though are those sweeter kinds of a reward. Compared to the security and fullness that you get from doing your duties well, those things which draw your creativity and lightness of touch provide more means of trust and rigor into your heart -whereas the latter gives more stretch to your bones, and settles them in. The effort that we truly seek are those ones in which we offer ourselves for the sake of contribution. In the case of our tasks and roles, we are simply trying to finish something -or at least reach a point where the goods of freedom begin. Our treatment of the world, in that sense, can never blossom enough and rewards us for ever doing so. I would illustrate this as if we were painting a portrait, in that we were satisfied in drawing the curves and shades of our line, but were then equally pleased in seeing the figure come together as a whole. On one hand, it might strictly be nice to look at, or draw you to feel a certain way by its gravity and strength. As the makers though there is something for us, or at the very least who know enough to be able to see the innermost and connecting parts. In that case, it is the stance of one familiar enough to find an appreciation, that such individual things could come together into this whole, and set itself apart as a complete form through and by these particular lines and pieces. It is as if we can see the delicacy and touch that went into shaping and setting each color, shade and line. In other words, our able eye can set back with a gaze that sees the whole for its entirety; but sifting through the sides are all the edges and places that bring all this together to form such union, whereby our delight and fulfillment is kindly pressed onto the time spent and seemingly produced into a unique portion. Therein, is that small piece that makes it more than just a whole, for we see it only with our own gracious claim as a thing that is marbling our baser impression of the whole.  
    <div class="qu"></div>The world thus, as I see it, is already smoldering and claimed when it comes to our viable treatment. Therefore, I suggest that we extract ourselves out of misery and dissent, and place our attention instead onto the priority setting of reverence, treatment, honor and care. “Doing so onto the workings of and development into the righteousness and reverence of either right or countering wrong, will give us an invincible claim, of which no dungeon or hell could protrude.”
 </div>
 <div id="ceaseofwrath">
    The world is just weird. We’re full of excitement and a good amount of cheer, yet no great amount of agreement with this will stall the idle and aimless feeling that corresponds with being out of shape and flat minded.  The consequent lack of comfort and respect for ourselves sees other people’s hopes and dreams rubbing against me, nor the opportunities of mine seeming as promising. “As generally, this dull state I’m in removes any notion of aims, and any ability of having one at that.”
    <br>&emsp;Despite such comparisons, I have noticed that in taking more time to become more rich and settled inwardly, our personal composition and steps have become both easier and firmer -aimed, if you will- and brought a simple standard ‘of simply being me’. As it were, we need not acquire or arrange for achievement; instead, we can strictly focus on and wish for the objects of our effort, or the interest and industry into formative creation, to be our forward path and leading direction. This compares with our legacy’d intent, whereby self importance deemed our rewards to match the caliber of the work I meant to do. In that case though, the burden of these creative demands saw me more still than moving; moreso, did the hopes and dreams that these achievements sensibly offered feel more unrealistic and narrow. And as a result, we wore ourselves out to an unproductive degree, which had me feeling both frail and stiffened (and accordingly idle), all while being burnt by other’s apparent successes, or pursuits at any rate.
    <br>&emsp;An important parallel is this notion of being a success based on virtue or environment. In my case I always sat towards the former, growing confident that the latter would become easier to address. This is no longer applicable. Instead, our efforts are meant to treat us to the most that being our best affords. Put another way, if I am strong and free, than it is my open and wholesome heart that is providing; and the offer is joy, but only. In other words, my interests in a stale state are those of circumstance -of which my wishes oblige. In a sounder and richer state, my claims are set on living well in abundance. Since that amounts to being active, regularly, then my consideration for what lies ahead corresponds to that kind of hopeful expectation; in that, my wish is to live, and is therefore what I wish to receive. When I consider and account for my circumstances then, or the simple needs for that living to be grasped, they are as a whole deemed and happily seen as motions and paths with righteous and flourishing activities as the lead, or gain rather whereby their effectiveness is weighed against. It is enough for me then to resolve myself to be who I am in this sort of way. Novelties are fine, and interests of the aesthetic sort will surely be capitalized upon if our fortune provides. But these are mere positions though. And be it preferable or not, or even objectively favorable or less so, it is who I am between that marks the point in which I will forever proceed. Moreover, in a few words or less, ‘that thing I wish for, regardless of the position, is rooted in and baked towards the generous creation I produce, with living actively and roundly as our gain’. 
    <div class="qu"></div>And this needs no other
    In short then, there is nothing for us to concern ourselves with aside from the coals which permit our hoped for living. To that, I personally would say that being able to sit comfortably and firmly, is the simple gate -or rather the line of which will reflect those ripe and leaner rewards. It is worth noting however that when it comes to opportunities and administrative tasks, that your favor is rightly sought for. The point though is that your choices and command regarding these tasks (and according acquisitions) should be at most employed as our highest values suggests -or afford at any rate. For example, if someone provides the chance to earn a fair share of money by simply filling out some forms, or perhaps it is a promising result based on performing a simple task, then your eligible oblige is truly worth admitting. However, if it is a permanent stay within a role that would truly hold you back from being as you ideally wished to be, then the comparably higher profits (in a monetary sense) would not be genuinely permitted. Now, you could choose the latter case and suspend your hopes for the finer horizon ahead. But be reminded that those dreams are not waiting for you to be more consistent and set, rather they will falter away with the remission of their being targeted. “That is what I have seen at least, or, better said, that withering of preferred sights is what my ambitions have dealt me.” 
    <div class="qu"></div>Simply put, the readied and unadorned decision to do something at the cost of your purer aims, will consequently see their place become less valued, leaving you with the complacent care for indulgence and novelty instead
    In any case, we should be mindful of our choices so that our genuine desires are met, or at least sought towards more clearly -as to make our steps firmer and aimed. The point is that the world has both the means for action and comfort. Excitement and frivolity surround the latter, whilst integrity and rest sit by the former. How you spend your time and what consequence you wish for your choices to claim, is determined ultimately by which side you lean upon. My preference is to hold myself in the highest regard, and deal with all the infidelities I contain so that I may sit easier and partake in the fertile and enjoyable activities of study and craft. I am not remissed though to make a choice that will remove friction from this path. I am, however, unobliged and without care to commit myself to efforts of a path which promises more than this simple smoothing; in that way, an interest in a certain profession or trip would seem to be rewarding, but my steadfastness notes that the required effort is more than I can ideally afford to contribute; moreso, that the reward on offer is a mere luxury and or garnish to my otherwise industrious and principled work. In other words, I weigh the expenses of things in terms of whether or not I will be sufficiently able to sit and work from there. Careers, the splendor and wares of travel, the general cost of restless moving and purchasing things, are neither desired or congenial to me. Only those things, in the harshest way, are compatible if they legitimately encourage or support my hopes and wishes to do as I genuinely please. And again, I mean not to discredit or ignore the rewards of those orbiting pleasures and aims: but I must and am happier to value and prioritize those which are close to me, ‘as they are not exotic and trivial, but dear’.

 <div id="ofmen">
    I would benefit from knowing the whole of things as well as those particular to me. For one, if my scope of knowledge is increased then my vanity will wain; as well, if we then turn to see what it is we actually have, then we won’t be so discontent or impotent on the notion ‘that this is where we are stuck’. This sentiment applies across a broad stretch of things. Putting forth the points relevant to us will yield a better view -of which the whole can wrap around. On the biggest scale, our place in the universe is waiting for pure definition. Beginning with our locale in the galaxy and its place within the local group, followed by the arrangement within the local cluster and its position within the Virgo Super cluster, and that place within the great Herculean Wall, summarizes our whereabouts. Our developments among life is also significant. From the earliest cells to fish, to basic land animals to the dinosaur kings, to mammals and bears, apes then humans, down the lane we’ve come. “Our present though has been reached after a long way.” Some insight here can relieve us of our ignorance within human activity as well as giving us more grace ‘as our cities and tools appear more fortuned’. Regarding our path of intent -in studying this- it begins with cosmogony, leading into cosmology and the formation of our sun and planet. Following this is the development of life alongside the solidifying of Earth’s surface and core; complexity arrives in both the environment and its inhabitants, culminating into a more tame set of species, including man. Beginning with migration and the early use of tools, we eventually reach a point of consolidation into agricultural societies, wherein the need and case for religious and judicial governance emerge.
    <br>&emsp;The peak of civilization rests on the inquiry of those who have surpassed our survival condition, proceeding rather to ask how within this freedom and divine view we should live our lives. Bureaucracy prevails though, temporarily at least. Outlasting this are the arrangements of a basic culture rooted in theology, being later surpassed by one baked within the senses and their deployment onto nature. Upon that is the imperative of civil liberty along with the imaginative limits reached within that natural approach. Strict resolutions are henceforth made and explicit regimes of society emerge, reflecting the polar response of an unknown world. “As, compared to the laws given by priests, the tenants of liberty and authority (in the civil sphere) are but suggested, however strongly.” The result is man’s ingenuity to command the bases of matter amidst his social conflicts, whereby his own destruction is gripped in the palm of his hand; he releases the trigger though as his corresponding aim is relaxed upon seeing how stern and narrowed his views were -and how unnecessary the certain devastation would be. He opens up, too much for some (as in the hippies), but in general tries to be more cooperative, establishing pacts of non violence and stupidity. The bulk of these efforts greatly outweighs the contrasting fools who ideologically remain; the playing field is so flat though that personal interest becomes more valued and agreed upon -this is due to the natural world still being in place, and despite there being no carnivorous buffoons, vanity still remains -which triggers an entitled response within an agreeable environment. The freedom that follows generates a similar response as those who became judicially narrow, only in this case the demanding nature is found within common civilities -gay rights for instance, in contrast to the previous prevalence of worrying about whether society should be communist or democratic. In this though, the conflicts are between folks rather than government. The process of this drains people into valuing the noise lesser and lesser, and instead, finding more useful and private means within the modern infrastructure.
    <br>&emsp;It seems that the reach of our day is one where freedom is left to vehemently reign. The conditions of life still remain though and the open lane to organize ourselves to respond leads to a restrictive view. I make this point to draw the conclusion that this kind of behaviour will in many ways remain. “Of dissatisfaction that is, despite our freedoms.” This is due to the ever present (and lasting) emotional response to the constant reality of the world. The issue, is that these extreme freedoms and openness are not given a humbling address. “Whereas we would be best to acknowledge that these fortunes were there to further allow us to survive, people take the vain novelties of this and act as though the fruits and wares of that are what needs protecting.” Consequently, even though contemporary advancements allow for such aims to be either taken or defended, the core implodes. “For how sad and free are we with all this fighting? It is like a King who has all, yet upon getting a little more becomes even more afraid that some will be lost -and he acts accordingly.” In contrast to this fact, is that people’s lows are (from modernity) high enough to be pleasing on their own. “Only the rich these days will act like the wealthy of old.” Those poor, have the modern taste, and are in fact much better off then those who were similarly classed in older times. That is our place.
    <br>&emsp;My point in all of this, for resolution’s sake, is that being included is merely optional. There are admittedly civil adjustments enacted by establishments and social custom, but being appropriately polite and kind seems completely sufficient in ignoring any sort of prompt or ask -for in this their concern is not triggered or applied. How this comes into effect consequently, is that people will use the freedom that they have to better address the forever remaining problems of the world. Compared to those who heatedly get sucked in and look only to remove difficulties -and ignore that we generally have what we need- this new flock of people will use the open tools and platform currently available to not simply bring the world to a necessary standard, but into a flourishing state, whereby the excesses bring those impoverished to a fairer level, but also into the marblings of the world, whereby similar fruits to the Renaissance are present and growing. “The excesses of positive ingenuity if you will; which in those older times birthed the explosive advents of science and liberty: ought we not have such fruits in this mighty modern age?”
    <div class="qu"></div>As Orwell has remarked within similar reflections about this, the current goal of man is not to remove any more of  his edge -or friction rather- but rather remark how amidst these freedoms,  he will actually live.

 <div id="ongreatness">
    As men and women, we are trying the manifest the best version of ourselves. Morseo, though, is this gain meant to be sustained, consistent that is. On one end you could say that our need to be so stout reflects the principle in play: where we fundamentally resolve ourselves to be strong and true. However, if this state is sought for beyond natural necessity, rather it is valuable to reach by a desire, then our meeting such point is consequently worthwhile to remain at -so we may continuously earn its treat. This is comparable to that old notion of reason’s constant place. In that case, it was suggested that since our achievements needed the accompaniment of reason in order to yield an accomplishment -for appreciation and use was genuinely made of the result- then we would also need her for the subsequent deliberation. The point there was that if the accomplishments were to be consistent then reason would have to ever remain by our side, thus making it a frequent member of all our positions, particularly when it comes to whereafter we set forth. How this compares to the value of greatness is that upon reaching this point, you will want to remain; in effect, our need for it and aim will not falter as we acquire it; rather, we will only see more of its use and reward for achieving so, thus drawing us to continue in its place and development -and easier to from the efficiency so far gained.
    <br>&emsp;Taking this to be true we can assess what being great means and discern what qualities it proposes us to forever be. Foremost is that all of our good and joy will come from ourselves. As Emerson says, ‘if you are trying to reach somewhere better than yourself then you will proceed to no avail; the world is indifferent in what it offers, differing only in the one who makes use of it’. The agency required of us then is ever present so long as we wish to achieve the good from being ourselves. In many ways our problems are self determined and will thus follow us wherever we go; moreso, will our benefit not accrue unless our practical ability is harnessed and disposed -compared to stretching yourself beyond what you can hope to personally do. To remove disclarity we will say that being resourceful, opportune and promise seeking as well as gregarious and kind, are none the lesser when displayed by a man: know though that it is only right when he does it when he can: rather than surmounting himself and abandoning where he personally sits and lives, aiming somewhere otherwise with the hope of some outer gain. Herein we can have friends and family, circles and groups for thinking and creation, relations with and respect for the institutions and ways to grow around us, we can. “But we must realize that they are elements that surround the actor in his play.” Our lines spoken and our acts done are what determine the account of all those things and whether or not they are around someone who has integrity intrinsically. “Wherein they could rest amongst a man, rather than being fortunes of a fool or child.” In one way you could see how avoiding yourself to pursue those fortunes would see you more apt to acquire them: but they likely slip away. Not only in your interest as you cannot be pleased or settled, but they correspondingly drift away -for their attention and grace is ever required, going elsewhere in which it is contrary to obtain.
    <br>&emsp;It is true that you will not be the king of England if your ambitions are nestled between writing and green, but need you even be so? If our aim is to be happy, flourishing and free, regularly, then should our resolution and satiety set itself outside the frame of this achievement? If we have acquired this and are continuing to do so, where is the need to hunger for more: are you not full? I reckon the discontent of this scenario is that the good we find in being ourselves is rooted in prominence; in other words, the fruits of being great only come from being so, though, it is of a prominent kind that your stature sings -rather than a complete sculpture or mold. Being the artist and or creator, our lane is not finished when our piece is complete. And thank goodness for that: for it was the joy we earned in the making that which accurately and heavily reflects our soundly sought nature: and in that is where we must choose to proceed and respect, in how our ‘being’ continues to live.
    <br>&emsp;There is in short a great deal for us to do. However, there is very little in the way of achievement, or rather that there is at most a receding point of what is necessary to consider beyond ‘simply doing our best’. As I see it the way forward is one that reflects the path we will forever take; at home, with ourselves, we will step forth with strength and grandeur, but accuracy and constance to. Down this lane there is nothing that does not apply; be it in work or trade, love and riches or even pleasure and delight, all is fair. The difference though for this better day is that our judgment of these things and corresponding action, are rooted in and baked towards the roundest and fullest expression of ourselves: the results of which need not be concerned in whether not there is something more than purely being me. In that case we can attest to the simplest and finest effort within all those fields applicable to us. The specifics will follow but I generally will say that it is not the sort of action that measures our goods, rather that we do so with the resolve to be merely well and true; and in that case earn the reverence and cheerfulness that comes from being pleased with being just and great.
    <div class="qu"></div>love is in the air, though its scent is from the pie of reason nestled on the porch, wafting here promise and sweets into our sense of virtuous resolve and treatment
    I just can’t sit here and wait to feel like we’re going no where; somewhere though is not what we are trying to achieve. We are simply working to be great. If our horizon is strong and more aspiration is set to carry us away, then I say good on you. “Here though, the heart of us does not lie.” Greatness is marked within someone fully and truly composed forever in themselves and all that this can bring. The struggle though is that, again, as I have found before, there is no clear aim on what we ought to do. Presently, our situation positively compares in that before we were still set on acquisition whereas now we can plainly see that there is nowhere that we can truly achieve. Something to point out then is in regards to doing things that will make you more successful when it comes to regional flexibility and friendship, but are done so by taking proper steps -instead of stressing over how these gains will be made. This distinction is essential due to the fact that one may find that certain actions deserve less attention than others which seem otherwise pure; instead, we should accept the fact that our sincere aim of being ourselves determines how our involvement with things will go and, thus, merit all things so long as your core principles remain. In other words, it is not writing and study that deserve more focus than web design and production; rather, we should assess what remarks the strongest and integrated version of ourselves, and bring all things across the board to fit the line of that.
    <br>&emsp;Let us bring the motion front and forth. We are men and this means we are mortal. We may believe in a God, but this means not that there is a benevolent animal or robed figure who will set you off to a cloudy heaven on a golden steed. “Nor do we find any soundness in the belief that he can intervene -for is he not already all, stably.” Herein, are the likely consequences of our accurate portrayal of thee all being, is one that brings us to a place of seeing that it is irreverent and ill proposed to us. Our disposition though can be better stated as already being set, and is thus worthwhile to recognize and adhere, rather than develop. We are gregarious, thoughtful, industrious, creative, principled, patient and kind. It is through our assessment of these things and thus bringing them out in our active lives, that marks the proper lane and freedom in which we’d properly be. The question though is how this lens of definement incorporates the prominent fact of our familial and civil, laborious, leisurely, credited and artisanal lives? An example may further the notion. If we were a farmer in 1852, then our triumph through grace would likely reflect the strength and valor within our principled achievement; we sowed the grass and broke the bread with little to no complaints, a sense of gratitude and placement, and, overall, a genuine smile of cheer that respected the fact that although your time was in some ways dirty and tough, you were alive, able to watch the sunset and see the moon rise; moreover could you address the fact that this stream of merriment and aim, would simply end by the natural guarantee of what allowed for existence to occur in the first place. In other words, this man, as a mark of who we would better be, is strictly one who makes the best use of his time: for it is all that is given.
 </div>
 <div id="forthesame">
    I think perhaps in times of stress or sluggishness, it would be best to go over the primary proposal of your life. Foremost, we will die. Moreover, will rest be given: peace for eternity if you will. Furthermore, we can say that this being true reflects the fortune given to us: for we would otherwise not be able to live. We have, in effect, been propped up into a more intricate manner in which grace and treatment can be experienced, but this active state is principally temporary. We can still see our death as just though -and thereby appreciate our fortunes- as it is what the promise of life guarantees.
    <br>&emsp;As living things we are born and raised; moreso, we are descended from less complex things. It is therein reasonable to suggest that our development did not occur in the void of space, but rather it advanced in a fruitful environment of which a planet could only provide. Before our deaths (in terms of our inquiry) we could say that our place in this world is strictly set in being on one of them. It is possible to imagine interplanetary travel, or some stellar object which sat as our home, ‘but we will stand at least on one’. That we are stuck on the one we originated from is not our strict concern; rather, what we will do on the one that is given. We might say that a planet compares to a country then, in that it is simply some conditional set of lines that vary in what they practically profess. Being interplanetary then seems irrelevant when it comes to how we live and proceed.
    <br>&emsp;Building on that I think a distinction is worthwhile to make. If you take a flight, or a shuttle, to another location, this we will call travel by transport. “Even though you are present within the expedition, your home and place is changing.” The point I would draw then is that our regard for living be baked into the locale in which we end up. Put another way, our city and town, or neighborhood block, reflect the scenario in which our living takes place. Even if you travel regularly and abroad, it is in the place that you end up in that your foremost activity of living begins. Even if the act of travel brings you satisfaction, I would suggest that this be simply viewed as an experience between the points where the bulk of living takes place. For example, if you travel by boat or plane, this may take a day, or several even; but your time in the place that you end up is considerably longer. Unless you plan to move around more than you actually stay in place, then we will concern our acts of living within our local scenario. In that sense, be it on Mars, or in Zimbabwe, Kentucky or New Orleans, the case of our living is generally limited to where we go in a day. Moreso, if those points using vehicles merely bring you to brief points in which you return, then it is that home of yours that holds the primary stake -or the neighborhood at any rate. In that case, as I have found, our time is spent walking around, or inside with more creative kinds of living. Whereas the former aspect can define the active scope of our scenario, the latter reflects the actual time we spend generously, industriously and creating.
    <div class="qu"></div>Life seems so simple then, when the little thats required to account for stems primarily from me: and where would that ever fail to be?
 </div>
 <div id="pureprecedent">
    As I’d put it the sum of our lives is in determining what will happen and how we can prepare, or proceed rather. The latter encourages us to develop strength and accuracy so that our hopes may be in check and that our misfortunes can be fought through. When the former aspect is given too much emphasis though, we tend to aggrandize our interest in real-estate and travel -novelties and sparkling promises if you will. Better said, we get hankered down on wishes for and expectations of some desire. In effect then, we underestimate the amount of work required to achieve these, and overestimate how much free time and use we will upon success have. This is why accuracy is so important. However, the issue -and where the problem arrives- is when we make natural mistakes, of indulgence let’s say, our mind is stiffened; consequently the future, be it nearby or far away, is given too much precedent. “And resulting from this are awoken desires, or the introduction of new ones.” This is simply because if the outcome of things are considered paramount, then our anticipations will surely bend towards self importance and requirement. Apprehension, the inability to rest and the fear of missing out become the repercussion. Moreover, if you have made progress prior to this disheveled state, then these present feelings of grief and yearning will seize your capacities and morn you with distrust. For even though there are better times and steady groves near and on the road, so too does that intrusive state of pleasure and promiscuous excitement leave you feeling miserable and tarnished. “Which, itself,  is wholly tearing and equally distasteful.” 
    <div class="qu">Grim tales, as they say, come through to those who are afraid of the dark, for they have too much experience in avoiding their shadow; herein upon the prompt that he is returning with force, does your mind and gaze bolster itself from behind, as your attention peals back towards that bleeding feeling of rancor and dread -and all those gouging chimera’s that follow. “Such are the woes of inconstancy”</div>
    Principles defend us against these faulty propositions. More than that, they keep us tailored in our better time so that our steps are furthered in the right direction -and avoid falling back. This yields us the ability to more easily sit in times of depravity, as well as keeping us motivated and clear during prosperous times, ‘wherein our decisions are made for the benefit of its continuation’. If we are prevented from reaching this point of inflammation and distress, then we will avoid any recourse and recovery. Instead, we can proceed down the rightful path, earning both the encouragement and respect of the heartfelt justice in our steps, but a bountiful rejoice also as we reflect on what we have so far become. “And all of this too, while dining on the wholesome flavors that we actually have.”
    <br>&emsp;The tipping point is when deliberation and pledge marry you to the stake of this triumph’s continuation. “In that case, it is our life and its great and greenfull goodness that marks us, carries us, drives forward to an end, and does so cheerfully and without wounding efforts, to a point that is right and true and down a course that is worthwhile to agree upon and be faithfully led.” 
    <br>&emsp;The resolve then seems very simple. Sharpen your sword so that you may cut through the thicket and bramble, forging a path that can be both followed and personally enjoyed; as well, take the time to learn where there were any holes and traps, so that more can make the trip and you can proceed knowing how to better explore. In addition,  the knowledge of an infirmary should become familiar with your mind so that any scrapes and bruises don’t lead to permanent damage or disease. Even worse, we should seek the avoidance of a wrongful change in direction. In that case, we are best to affirm the strongest principles that earn us a great and lasting defense, as well as sculpting a mold of where we mean to go and seek to achieve. In this way our accuracy of deliberation and corresponding suitability for a genuine resolve will see that we can proceed through distraction and uncertainty. And with a pleasing certainty too! 
    <br>&emsp;I cannot promise that there is something on the other side; at most I can say that our end will not require or benefit those to cut down a path and travel.  Our lives seem ripe for this sort of being, in that our conquest was in the marching and advance, rather than taking steps with the aim of stopping.  ####Moreover, we could address the fact that the entire possibility of our adventure lie in some sort of wood. 
    <br>&emsp;Paths will be made with trails that follow; predators will stalk us, drawing us into injury or malicious ends; and to those fruits that we may find or the openings where more in front can be graciously seen, are still short of a permanent stay. “For if we stop, not the most on offer could otherwise prevent us from wishing we could proceed with nothing at all.” We are men, not objects. Those are what we look at and see. Moreso, they are what we as men subject them to. It is our industry and righteous passion that determines the boldness and fullness of heart, soul and mind. It is only in knowing this as true though that we will avoid the shambles of foolish and destructive varieties that those faculties potentially hold. 
    <br>&emsp;There are principles that prove this. Moreso, there is a great deal of strong evidence that bears comparable suggestion. Moreover, our very activity within these points of evidence -upon reflection and association- turn us towards the proper use of them. Herein, we can know that our presence as inquirers is smaller than the elements which our judgment holds. “Their place is at least more permanent than ours.” In effect, we can bank ourselves towards them as the things clearly worth our submission; and in that can the means which we employed to address them use similar faculties to better understand their meaning to us, and earn us a more rich and prosperous resolve -one of increased empirical accuracy to, for we gave an increased yet humble amount of care. “But rest easy, for that is all you’ll find -in your lasting mind- in this indebted reproach.””
 </div>
 <div id="forgoodness">
    I am thinking that in order to take the truest step, we must know where it is we are trying to go. For some time this notion was saturated with active sentiments of ‘experience and joy’, whereas of late I’ve been thinking, with respect to our stake, that a reflective judgement could bear us a pass, ’where we were pleased to simply look back happily’. This would indeed be enough, and allow me to mortally proceed.  
    <br>&emsp;Specifically though, it is hard to say what to do. One of the reasons is that things generally do move with a natural tendency towards some end, and willing ourselves to some objective -rather than bending towards one rooted naturally within- is difficult, as our progress is banked outside of our own proclivity. You would think that who we are would cleanly manifest itself in whichever way was congenial to it. But the concern, is in our deliberation and care, and which end is in fact so; moreover, whether this characteristic (of being formative, or contrived) is truly worthwhile to resolve to?
    <br>&emsp;I think there is an answer. Perhaps it is the case that through our civil development, those well off have lost the judge, which for all of time drew out our nature. As before we were put to the test, to run and hide, commune and gather, but now were at best stressed by the characterized hoarding. “Literally, or in food for example, what a fortune!” Nihilism, Existentialism, Theological debate or simple determinism (by virtue of physics), seem to be fair as the response within this neutered state -when there is no trouble left. I believe this is wrong though. For one, this attempt to live outside of our inner nature is a struggle, for the ends of those claims are as incomplete as the ones in these leveled times. In other words, our attempt to proceed is fabricated on the basis of our fortunes smoothing the way; the concept though defines this as irregular and vain on the pure fact that these intentions are built up, rather than ingrained. That is why we all feel so much trouble despite the fact that there is an abundance of goodness and fortune around us. This in many ways shows us the fact that our living is the front measure, rather than those things around.
    <br>&emsp;In a thinner state our tendency is to look towards outward things, rather than find alignment to ourselves. It is as if we are cleaning fish who have lost their host and have no sense of what to otherwise do; consequently, they flutter about in search of some other whale or shark, and are unhappy and restless until they find a candidate. That latter notion reflects the fact that one’s nature is in effect calibrated to proceed into the world in a way in which those outward things fall in line with it. What I see happening though is that when the prominence of those inner tendencies are removed -by virtue of modern civilization- then the mark for its expression is shortened, wherein the effect is that it has less congruency to be produced, in that it has less that it is meant to do. The issue though is that the core of these ordinances remain: they have simply been relaxed and flattened. “Like muscles which have had nothing to lift, but the fibers remain.”
    <br>&emsp;The response is generally to find outward things that are enticing enough or rightfully substantial in as much as they draw us forward to meet them and interact. On the prior point though, this merely reflects the fact that (seeing as our nature, or one at least is present -regardless of stature or state) some action is needed. To be clear this is fair; considering our root of living, it makes sense that in absence of personal care or demand that some recreational or(for example) divine purpose will be sought so that an expression can be made. This seems legitimate. The thing is, that on one end I suspect that our inner nature is better prepped to deal us a riper existence, while on the other, or in addition at least, I am skeptical, and in many ways critical and cynical, that outer ventures will be enough. Perhaps it all comes down to education. The need for maturity and strength is, for the sake of our tale, lost and forgotten amidst our industrial fortunes. Interestingly though, and to my point, that even though we are warm and safe, we all still wish to, and evidently do, live. The action though that generally follows is somewhat small and hollow in my estimate; moreso, do those who admittedly live more vast and impactful lives, still fail to meet anything that is truly lasting and sound -in other words, the vain attempts and rewards of entrepreneurial and political success.
    <br>&emsp;Here though, we have an answer. To preface, it must be disclosed that this proposal is rooted in my own personal attentions; better said, in my own fortunes have I diligently addressed the fact that without living I am tired and frail, and that within my otherwise attempts I am short and unfulfilled. What then do I mean to say? What I seek to explain is that by paying attention to one’s self, prompted by the honest assessment that those factors of proper living are poorly met, encourages and directs one to well founded living. As we have stated, being fortunate alongside others around you, yields you less outward guidance or personal motivation to inwardly succeed. “In that way, those issues of idleness and vanity lay.” If we notice this, and assent to the fact that living is in fact our only gain, then we can consider the underlying nature that relishes in being so active, and henceforth resolve to bring that out so that our agency is measured by and settled towards a fuller and lasting expression. In many ways, the proposal here is rooted within the suggestion of being wise. “Notice your need to act, and evaluate whether a reflected happiness and proceeding joy will result from worldly ambitions and childish aims? Be honest about this and ordain yourself to the path in which the answer shows. Only here will something truly promising and profitable grow.”
    <div class="qu">And oh how ripe it is; yet ignorance that this freshness and play is the real stake, will see our otherwise ambitions and dreams wither us away</div>
    Considering that wisdom then, how should we ultimately proceed? Well, for one, if we are clear on the fact that our inner nature needs to be upended and instated as the base of our action, then we must make the hardest distinction between necessary development and just expression. Seeing as we are looking inwards, or back let’s say, on the basis that what lies in front is unappealing, then our resolve to go back to the space where our reflections see, is effectively one of suspense and regress. This is simply the humble task for one who wishes to reorient and therein proceed further and prospectively. An old quote then seems appropriate. “Some, when climbing a mountain, come to the end of their current path. They can in some cases see higher, but the trail is blocked ahead. There are two choices: one, you stay there with complacency or complaints, or two, you make that inspection of possible routes below, and genuinely respect the offer it holds and accordingly act. In this way, you will have to go back down; moreso, will the new path ahead likely require new kinds of skill and development. It is only a man though, or one who is mature, who not only sees this and its value, but amends themselves to make the struggle, the heart of which is not in the effort, rather in the humility of recalibration, wherein they follow the patience and care required to bring out those corresponding ends. To that, we all have a mountain to climb. Though, it is those who are best at climbing that will earn the most all the way, as their abilities come from the constancy of use, the soul of which is given by their constant respect for the medium in which their skills exist. Consequently, the varying nature of the mountain delivers the law for the climber: and out of gracious respect, he resolves himself to this way happily, as if it were fertile and just.”
    <br>&emsp;This parable has a limit though. Whereas a mountain is arranged under comparable routes and terrain, the life and intent of one living well is fundamentally different than those who are idle or seeking ambition. At its core, those who are still are not living, and their account, by virtue of being ones like us with the need for expression, will be considered as temporarily out of the game. “And their regard will at most be suspended under the notion that their involvement in the other two will at some point happen.” Regarding ambitions, or vanity, these are ultimately unpromising. Foremost, to clearly reiterate, is that their hope is within acquisition, the root of which comes from a thinned nature looking to express itself, but ultimately finding, upon success, an imperative need to continue doing more. Consequently, the main critique of these sort of aims is that upon their end, they strictly need more: and how is that in anyway fulfilling? Take that to be the case for outward living, more or less.
    <br>&emsp;Regarding that reroute towards the inner path, this one, aside from the reflection and resolve to bring out its ability in action, has different formats and interests with respect to how they (being full natured) wish to live. In their case, the hope is not within fame, gold or position; rather, the abundance that they seek is in how they actually live. In this way, their path is littered with activities such as writing and study, personal training and diligence, friendship within men of old or creative moderns, and altogether a slew of things which draw their aim of living -and marry them proudly to a stake that allows for their treatment and participation. The difference is clear to me. While those of outward intent earn their satisfaction through progress and dreams, these ones of living gain their wealth from actual involvement with the activities on hand; moreso, do they embellish upon these and increase their fruitfulness by paying time and attention to the subjects and topics of interest, refining their deliberative intent and creative means, and overall solidifying their reverence for the path of leisure and craft at hand.
    <br>&emsp;In short, the man of living forges himself to be so. By the graces of his fortuned time, he respects the fact that being free is not equal to living; this consequently drives him to solidify and protect the prominence of what that life of activity fully means. Corresponding with that, as follows, is a loving care for what others have done and a generous approach to being similarly expressive and productive; moreso, he takes notes on the fact regarding who is offering and what they provide, so that his grace and settlement on the present abundance can take a lasting hold, along with proposing himself to the end of this lane and its flavor of living -by the greatest sorts of expression and tribute that he is able to and means to give. “I am not sure there is enough virtue, reason or point in the contrasting path of ambition, that would allow for or invite such colorfulness in respectively describing their intent?”
    <br>&emsp;I will say one last thing, in closing. Even though action seems necessary for anyone with a nature, and although our need for survival and stabilizing effort is fortunately no longer needed, our place as ones in these privileged times is still baked with the fact that our nature remains. Even though the demands and subsequent tradition of maturity and strength increasingly wain, the lower prominence of our ability and care to live removes no amount of worth or claim that is found through riper and well founded living. In a way though, our truest account and interest to live remains a servant to the nature of those who are living. Forgo the nature of a rock for one second; we are trying to attest to the constancy and success of one who has more willfulness and animation, the nature’s of which we describe as living. Regarding those with this ordinance of an expressive need for the according life, is still surmounted and operative to the field of the limits of living. In that way, even if our natures are abundantly freeing and flourished, there is only a short amount where this can be so; for even though during our time when we can address the fact of living and resolve ourselves to be so, as I have found at least, you still feel as though your dancing into none. Let it be known though, for it personally comforts me, that similar to that rest I enjoy during and between our days of living, that having some that is even more free and lasting after all our time is done, is no bother or nail in me.

 <div id="truemovement">
    Over my years, I have gathered a great deal of inner peace and satiety from permitting my aims and actions to be enjoyable and promising in and of themselves. This did not always offer much besides our pleasant time, nor was it always accepted, or understood at any rate; but the ease and benefit from doing so has definitely outgrown those shortcomings.
    <br>&emsp;One result of this has been the sentiment of horizontal and vertical movement. The former reflects the change from ambition, wherein a position or possession is gained, while the latter marks the reach of one in their actual living. What this amounts to is a fair disregard for our change of fortune or equity, but instead a vehement and just ascendance to a place in which we see the world and treat it, in and wherever we are, no matter where we’re at. For instance, some may wish to travel to far off and exotic places, be it for the excitement of going somewhere or the novel interests that promise their delight, while others may simply enjoy what they have (and are privy too) where their currently at, whereby the passing sun and moon, the birds humming, the clouds drifting away, all the colors and other norms of our common place, are both enough and, in a way, wholesomely pleasing, ‘for we went to no place far off -with its according expense- to see and be pleased, but rather we helmed ourselves to be so upright and keen for those splendors outside our door’. Which, itself, is something both admirable in its simplicity and reliable in that the only limit is us and our ability to gaze ever higher. “As opposed to fortune, who grants us only steps from side to side.”
    <div class="qu">My constitution is best when it is so well founded and composed, that a reverent tribute to all that draws us and the leading profit of treatment and joy are gained, is readily and forever established and done, no matter the place, whenever the time, in whichever the house, country or norm: we are already made, we are in all places the same, but it is our true and aligned posture to this always present way, that reflects the solidity of one rooted in such a way that the goods of this greatness are simply and widely achieved</div>
    Being who we are, so malleable that is, I feel like our particular aspects within the genre of human, must be thought on and designed. Otherwise, our more primitive and innate features will become embellished and our natural tendency will grow towards indulgence and ignorant gain. We are set for any and all, and those that truly treat us to the most require even more attention and care to become fully disposed to and engrained. “Again, as said, it is only the easiest and immediate to become entrenched in sulking pleasures and foolish ambitions . To conduct ourselves in a way that earns an inner respect along with the sense of being pleased (with oneself), is not so simple or ready to acquire. There, we must actually think on and define the world through the measure of the accomplishments we genuinely wish to find, for even if we were the King of all, able to forever and in any place be, so would those fruits of activity and expression require nothing more than even the poorest man had. “And such alignment and respect limits us only by our regard.”
    <br>&emsp;At any rate, reason is our friend here as is consistency and grace. Done so regularly and we will be treated to the utmost gift that comes from attention and care; that is, a frequent set of joy and flourishing, as well as the promise and stability found through valid and solid prospering. Doing so, to reiterate, cannot be so half hazardly or passively achieve -nor with any naivety of whats required, or the misguidance of thinking that fortune is what such activity is for. “For the aim of generous deliberation that we seek, can only give us the claim we wish for through an equally bound set of similarly thoughtful action.”
 </div>
 <div id="dearways">
    I will die. This I cannot prove or claim to be explicitly true; but I believe it to be a sound position. “That it will happen at least.” This limit is placed on me justly though, for my time spent at this point is filled with appreciation and joy. And until that day where I end in hope without sorrow, I will live, as if my time was briefly spent being prior to a lasting rest. Though, there is much that can go wrong amidst these active portions of our days, as we may find ourselves stiff and idle, or full of toil and unease. My solution to this is to ingratiate ourselves into the path of righteousness and freedom: if chosen otherwise then discontent will naturally propel you back to the former state. The resolve though, should be one where that proper way forms into something regularly acted upon, whereby the stance of it is constant and upright, whilst letting you bring it out and act upon it -in which the greatest living is gained.
    <br>&emsp;There is a state of goodness that is not only known to me, wherein it settles not only deeply but expressively, but inscribes itself into the world in the most abundant of ways. The picture that it paints is not only vivid and kind, but full of grip and matter; consequently, I not only see but am part of this rich portrayal of the world around me. “What is shown and born from this creator, is where I mean to go.” Put another way, I enjoy what our best self has to offer; not only in the production that it makes, but the clarity that it offers -and the deliberation that fittingly follows. When I am with this man there are wants and needs that beautifully measure up to the richness of the world; when I am touched with such slivers of profit and joy, I can color more, as my palette is not only cleansed from drowning shades, but full of applicable vibrance and hues -which bears the colorful employment of my mind. In this illustration the horrors of the world are but mere stains on an otherwise gifted tapestry; moreso, the goods and green of it all are not limited to hope and pungent hues, but full of deep wonders that reminisce of rainbow scarlet. “Of a whole which is varied with silky joy.” 
    <br>&emsp;My nature is one where this portrait is made, but it is not enough to simply know this:  I must see it. And no wonder, as my heart becomes full of grit and slate when I meagerly stand, thinly noticing the whole of entirety, ‘whose passing glances offer nothing more than scorn and flame’. It is only when my sight is active, as if the breadth of that portrait is more than a garnish but the combined parts of nature herself; whereby I take her hand, tenderly, smiling, and see her sides glistening in welcomed red, vehement orange, pearl yellow, humble blue, sufficient gray and, foremost and to my place as one so small, ‘that glowing grain of green and harmony’. 
    <div class="qu">The latter stitch is where my heart is fit and sown -and all the rest graciously follow</div>
    For many years I had the simple aim of living well, but was imposed upon to have an objective within it. In part this was sound, for that well being and its active elements required a place to work from. The issue though was that I could not find any interest or conception about the means to do these things ‘when it was the simple act of existing that proved enough to do them in abundance’. In that case, I matured and was humbled. Though, this did not result in those truer joys being more embellished; rather, I let them drift gently to the side whereby I sought for them when I could, but responsibly tended to my post with the appreciative knowledge that they were there besides us: our role though had become the primary factor. As I grew I realized that the issue was in the thinness of those joyous aims. What I saw was that they had no form and width in themselves and were therein being shunted by the obligations surrounding them. Now, I realize that beyond being more firmly set, these goals of generous craft are not meant to acquire me anything more than being active in them. There is promise admittedly, but this is not a concern, but rather a suggestion of how the proficiency in these wholesome efforts will provide me with the room and means to do them more and better. ”All that is required though, is in me, as the tailor, and the object of my efforts, the mark of my craft, needs itself an aim and commitment: the resolve of which has made me happier than I’ve ever been before.”
    <br>&emsp;As it stands, there are two principles I’ve discovered regarding this notion -of mere creative ambition. Firstly, is that monetary (or professional, in other words) ambition cannot yield any sort of well-being.  Simply, the asset being developed will not in any short amount of time allow the maker to forgo maintenance, and that even if the time of the person is eventually given free, the skill of appreciation and heart of gratitude will not have been given ample time to grow -for those achievements which gave you an actual (or wholesome at least) reward. On the former, the time offered as a response to the asset’s success will be less viable for use because the product continuously demands support, along with encouraging further development -prolonging the fill of your time. On the latter, the joys and wonder gifted to one who has the freedom to see them, will not be optimally known -or cultivated rather- as their sight was not the mark of achievement. “And by such outwardly ambitions, our creative ones are accordingly familiar and in tune.”
    <div class="qu">Its as if we reached a point where we could have all the food in the world but our palette was untrained, as well as being stained from the time until then, when during the ambitious progression indulgence and sweat were all that we tasted: and how can we now be as well nourished, satisfied or sustained through these purer goods which are now on offer? I’d venture that the results we are treated to are those that reflect the ends which our position is rooted in: those grasping ambitions</div>
    The second principle demonstrates the limit of fortune. To preface, the friction in our lives prevents us from fully investing our time in the fullest abundance. Fortune, describes the privilege earned through relations and family, the patronage of institutions or government, the luck of choices and investment, and the promise of formative and congruent action -or the simplicity that comes from being well tempered and formed.  In total (or on their own), these level out the path of all moving forward. They remove the holes in the ground and smooth the road ahead. A driver is not made though, nor is he given a friend. The principle in question reflects the genuine desires of those generous, rationale and kind, and how the reach of their expression within these is only acquired through being thoughtful, objective and deliberate. “Fortune merely gives us the time and ease to do so, wherein the route ahead had only the regard for joyous achievement -rather than some further position.” The principle though, marks the fact that even if you were king, omnipotent and immortal, that living would still be required for the foremost measure to be acquired -of living that is. And seeing as this result only comes through action, tribute and participation, our strongest effort demands not only that we are stout and able as to allow such expression, but also that we figure out what draws such treatment: both so we have a mold to contribute towards, but therein a draw that earns us those riches of being thrown in -or invested rather and engaged. In other words, the limit of a crown is that it does not necessarily procure the interest or skill in meeting those heartiest of claims. And interestingly enough, if the man in charge did in fact surrender his intent to those things which would actually make him happy, then the position he was in would become less crucial (in his wants), and perhaps a burden, as his time held more worth in raising the solidity of his aims and self.
    <div class="qu">For they are what pull him along, nor is flat footedness or a dull mind welcomed even in the courts of monarchial ambition</div>
 </div>
 <div id="forall">
    There is so much good in this world that an error on my part has been made. We came from a green part of the wood, but were not shaped to hold it all in; perhaps if we had, then the winds and weather ahead would have seen us more rooted in: it simply blew us over. I wish I had known though that the trees were not our object of final interest. As time has gone on I have realized that it is the fruit it produces, the views from the canopy, the home for me and friends. "Each and all being worth our time to deepen the trunk." Moreso, to note, does the base of it allow us to venture around. If it is into the nearby meadows and glades then to this we can be most grateful; and if it is through brambles and mud then we can surely feel the same, though in this case fortuned that our trouble will not burn us permanently, or at the least keep us forever low and the same.
    <br>&emsp;I live in Kamloops now, or should I say the dry snow den. It may not be soon but clear skies of early blue and evening red will consistently come; moreover will the flats and hills around open up for us to rest and gaze at these sights. From a studious point I am encouraged to learn about these elements and what their schedule is, along with the cogs that shuttle them to come and go as they are set to forever be. The reason for this refers to our limited grasp on the world and the rush that we have to see it whenever we feel our hands beginning to slip. The idea can be fully expressed in the following way. I quote, "In a VR experience, there was a flight through the deserts of Nambia; all these hills and dunes of burnt orange sand and the yellow shine of the sun glazing it uniformly, serene. What I noticed though is that within this immersive view -from a helicopter mind you- the world was not so vast or grand in any way; the horizon surely kept some timely secrets as well as the color and grit of the local sand, but it was for itself in this locale, and thus to those present, this was their only own."
    <br>&emsp;The point I'd make is whether or not those who own much more have the time or interest to see it? Moreover, is there any significant sort of you who actually have such scope in your lives, or even the means to keep it(in regards to momentary travel). From the ground up it seems like our place is set locally or, per our limit, will settle into one that reflects the same. This latter notion is worth clarifying. You may expect that fortune's offer to travel is worthwhile and thus the corresponding effort demanded is just; mark that fact though that it will in no short of time ease itself into a home and place that is similar to the one that you left. "Know this before going anywhere, that each and all is the same."
    <br>&emsp;To end I would say that the other interesting fact is that each of these locales, be it set in or arriving to, are really worthwhile and unique because of the variations they possess: the mold is ubiquitous though. Those deserts are only foreign to those who have not been there yet. If you were there then the joy would be in seeing the areas and time that the sun set, the in and outs of the walls of sand along with the ever going view of the dunes expanse: as the good, it is merely one of this specific area, and is thus the good which is familiar to those present. "Flavors will vary, as will our ability to taste, but the heart of food, or there being good in the matter, will equal out no matter the place: for all it means is what we see, and no spot holds more or less possibility."
    <br>&emsp;The conclusion rests then on the realization that where we are at has the same possible interests and marks of appreciation as any place that you may wish to go; yearning to do so then is simply more trivial due to the eventual adjustment you'd make, and futile if you wish to move some more. Bringing ourselves to respect and stair at our current points will allow for the gifts of genuine fortune to materialize themselves more fully: for in this state of grace will your present living see improvements, therein affording you the chances and time to go where the variety's of something genuinely draw you. You can go there without prior unsettlement though; for you know that your sitting point will at heart be the same, and structurally similar as well. All that means is that to each and every thing, are there equal claims of good to see: for the means to doing so is strictly onto our grace and vision, of which has no opportune place that permits its better use, or at all. "We bring out the world the same: and vanity is thinking some will bare a better offer, rather than you being the one who realizes the gain."
 </div>
 <div id="particulars">
    If the good is found in proper activity, how can we better understand what particular elements or ideas are sound? For one, we can consider that the value baked into that goodness is one of robustness, evenness, regularity and care. Regarding that, an action or movement is only fair if it is of the sort and kind with respect to those requirements. For example, drinking overly will cause you to sweat and falter, leaving you with little attentive possibility ahead, nor reflective ability; as well, does the miscarriage of these choices leave you outside the lane of what is true and normal; in that, you will need to re-regulate yourself to that proper way, therefore entailing that the current path is wrong -for it would otherwise not have to be changed. What about exercise though, we ought to take part in some of those? Well, let us not define things so limitedly; we may as well equate civil rights studies with those of engineering; moreso, for each let's say, would the ends differing -for vain or just reasons to name some- alter the sort of movement that you were doing. And so, of things that we are doing, we may do them in a different way, changing by the results we find. This is why vain actions are poor because the opposing route that is truly rich will have to be amended to later. "Whichever path demanded you change direction is not a good one then." Of the kind of action, be it of this training or that employment, is similarly valued as good when the heart of the motions involved produce the profits of living. "Being a doctor is not bad, but if the aim of it and resolve was thoughtlessly formed and set for dreams and ambition, then the reward of being generously involved will not be proficiently sought; herein, a comparable direction will need to be changed, as well as leaving you worse off and empty upon the fruition of this frailish end."
    <br>&emsp;Forewardly then, would I say that our scale for assessing things is bound through the results that are truly offered, and whether or not the path to these can be continually sought. The former to me is rooted within joy and the corresponding need for private thinking and development, along with the suitability for acquiring true and genuine friendship. In effect, we may know where to go that will yield us the environment and task that we can abundantly throw ourselves into, and, additionally, attract others who are admirably the same, and therein be set for a properly just team of acquaintances -or a simple friend. Considering who you wish to be in this regard and what elements are most appropriate for this portrait of yourself to become most realized, is fundamentally required. For if we don't, even if our view was to joy, we would have less clarity onto what would provide this, and consequently see you acting relatively astray. That is why our ends must be thought of; for if we are doctors without any regard for the relevant activities(near and later) when it comes to living, then we will not sufficiently reach them, in both presence or appreciation. Moreso, if the activities that we reach bar us from proceeding, then we are only moving further away from that most desirable point and all its accompanying means for lasting participation and activity.
    <br>&emsp;Let me just say what this form of thinking amounts to on my own end. At the front we have our industry's effort being applied to formatting a journal and sharpening its offerings. This, marks the greatest version of myself, both in terms of what I have done and am in need to improve, along with what will bring me the most forth, and so in the soundest way. Right beneath this are a slew of private and objective interests. These are a mix of A) things that I wish to be more clear on for clarity and benefits sake, and B) those which require an outline and solidifying of terms and ideas, so that the topics and interests can be subject to later industry and formative care. These efforts are not concerned with outlook and appeal; rather they are there to personally suit me, or become viable for that great front of treatment. "I have distinguished these kinds of works so that those proper for rigorous attention have the appropriate amount of time, whilst those in a more cultivating state are neither draining on me with expectations to be treated better, as well as getting the actual objective and preliminary work done -because we are free from ambitious pressures and guarantees." In that case, these private interests are proficiently bold when it comes to the second rule of 'active consideration'. The former to be clear, that is our industry, does oblige the considerate thought of what is appropriate and fitting within that class(of rigor and display), only the foremost rule of 'aims suitable for constancy is also given prevalence and attention. In that case, we are set only on producing what we can, and sharing it for the sake of teaching, composure(from sharing and its confiding benefit), and the utmost increase of our accountability and vested interest. At least, to me, will the aim of this be met fully through sharpening what we have through a suitably portraited and fertile display, and congruently offering the goods from this production onto appropriate platforms such as LinkedIn, Medium, in a sort of way on Twitter, and other writing platforms that share the worth of bound through the heart of our thinking. To that the rule is followed.
 </div>
 <div id="ourline">
    The promise of success and the certainty of how it will be acquired is not truly reminiscent of what I even seek. My wish is to invest more and earn more through activities, be it of an artisan style of craft, or in my business of work and labor -of a good kind that is. Moreover does the requirement of these to be furthered call on a friendship, particularly a friend; the former is found through any and all when similarities are revolved around and triumph or defeat has a comparable cause; the latter though marks one who has these features but lives nearby, close enough that letters and voice chat were not the extent to which our friendship flourished. We need someone we can not only actively but regularly and intimately co-operate on and develop; this means our training, leisure, eating and rest is not done alone with separate interactions between; rather me and my friend (s) are staked around those aspects together, wherein the cultivation and aim of our friendship has more robust and concurrent attention. "That would give much ground around me, as opposed to their being friendly lands nearby."
    <br>&emsp;In addition, it is worth it to add how these friends can be acquired. Generally, there are two suitable ways. One is that you show people at home, that you know or some colleague or possible peer/friend, the work that you have done and mean to do; this is what gives our website so much local appeal. Moreso then, if this can occur and more work can develop -which our private efforts follow - then that expression opens up possibilities for people who are regionally close to become your acquaintance. This case is worth reflecting on. Most people are suitable for living well and creation of some kind; circumstances will likely bring any group together, though not each of its members will be so prominent. Anyone can help and aid you in furthering the scope of your expression, but it is from there that those more prominent and bound can hear what you proclaim, and more reasonably travel and associate. This is why internet friends or people that you meet from afar -who have few possibilities in forming relationships- are not so worthwhile when it comes to our most basic and forming expression.
    <br>&emsp;The point is that our place from the ground up is not aimed at acquiring something, or desiring things that are outside of our reasonable capability; moreover, are we not going to fidget or fret over efficiencies that we could employ with the aim of leveraging our sounder actions: for truest efforts, at even a minor scale, will earn a suitable reward. What we seek is to have more discussions, review movies and play more games. Moreso, do I seek to do this with other people. "It is those by my side though, who are close enough that we could share our gaze up towards the stars, that this cooperative creativity reaches the highest place. Otherwise, you are only part of my community -while the formers are my wholehearted friends."
    <br>&emsp;Moving forward then, I will proceed till someone stops me; if they do I will not be bothered for my understanding was never placed on A) this never happening, and B) that the result of continuing was necessary. Prevention, obligations, doubts and unambition are no trouble for one who wishes to be consistently generous and kind. It is true that these mark a flourishing state of me and that being stuck in a hole would not be preferable; favorable results though are in most ways outside fortune's control: for what will happen is what is likely, and this is for the most part out of my control. It is foolish to think that the things which would impede you are those which are uncommon and unnatural; these are not worth accommodating as their place is unknown and hard to prepare. When it comes to sickness, the demands of labor and the toils of mistakes that cause a stiff body and restless mind, these can be addressed and taken on in preparation; we know they will in whichever way happen, and thus are not worthwhile to avoid. Per our resolution, would becoming more apt and able in all of these situations be the most advantageous; knowing what will happen is worth considering beforehand so it is never a shock and deemed unfair, and to all those which will occur upon recklessness and poor self control not be so, if your time and attention is honed towards supporting more worthwhile values and things: the claim of which is forever, and equally just in staking our growth. "For it grants us increasing amounts of ease and capability."
    <br>&emsp;Our line is forever; moreso is our ability to acquire limited by the principle of allocation. Moreover, would achieving such wealthy ends serve us nothing more than the interest to do as we would now; or, in short, that no matter the width or smoothness of the road, or the vehicle in which we were set in, would not make us either a good and appreciative driver, or give us a friend -who would make the trip more significant and bearable. "Instead of worrying about the net we have and how the fish will swim in it, let us trust our grip and knowledge that 'if there are fish and our deployment is well placed', then our hopes can at least seem fair and happy by the effort we made and the fact that it was best placed - therein giving us enough."
    <br>&emsp;In practice, our ambitions should focus on what will be seen as opposed to whether or how it will be or not. That space is too crowded and ill suited for our resolve and action; our bet is in the work that gathers the time, pleasure, ease and attention by me and those yearning to live well. Doing so then is much more promising within the hopes more reasonable to what's common. What reassures me is that our expectations of grandeur and success have had very little stay in both our personal hopes and interests, as well as what we have familialy conveyed. "If I were set and settled by those rules of choice, privilege, patronage or congruence, then we could barrel forth in the most consistent and gentle ways, making forth through and by the production of things that reflect our innermost draw, and bending ourselves to the mere satisfaction that this is our sought for existence." Perhaps the heart of our roominess and discontent is in the realities of our world and its struggle, and the then present wish to remove it so more time and effort can be spent as we genuinely please. The hopes that rise above this are the most pernicious to me; they drive you out of your home and place, seeing more sparkly and possible ventures inside business and international appeal. The mark of this is in a poor outlook on the world. Here, we think others really care, or are there and pledged to be looking. "Everyone returns home, where those foremost works are done. My place is one where, be it by friends or outward companions, we start from this central place, bringing ourself out through the very mark of our production. Nothing more could ever wished to be accomplished. And if we gain the ability and fortune to do more, then we will know that it was from a spot that was set for more of the same, and ill favoured to foolish wishes besides and above."
    <div class="qu">As my heart is telling me, would something close and nearby be enough. And as an increased point of density, is it an improvment over a lighter yet boread scope of many folks around. "It is just so hard to settle into the ultimate truth, that the former notin reeally falls on you, to at least be a friend of your own -for that is the heart of being local, in which you could then host a friend."</div>
    Now, my choices can bury us in our current scenario(or any for that matter). We must distinguish though the state of our work and its production and whether or not it is in the midst of revealing yourself to a friend, or if it is in a state where its impression and or fruition is on the edge of being seen. We are not there though. We may never be. It is possible that life continues to offer and task, and we innerly work by our own standing forever through the days. Like most of our time and what we could expect it to be, will we be merely looking up then, hoping for nothing more than to continue our place in this environment, by ourself or not. In that case, it is our desire and respect to watch the sun and moon, and beholden ourselves to the short and long term positions and accommodations that allow us to better anticipate and expect their happening. In other words, of all that there is good and green in the world, there are two things that bolt us properly to floor: the admiration of those alike who similarly revere and delight in the greatness that is uniformly on display, followed and aside the balance and composure to maintain and relish the aim of this offer, 'continuing to trust that the active state required to engrain the anticipation and trust of it happening, is simply and freely enough for me, and thus a marked measure of a friend greatly compared to me'.
    <br>&emsp;This question is worthwhile in going over, briefly at least. That is the distinction between our work and ambition, and our personal lives. In other words, what life will we have that is common and everyday regardless if we run businesses, countries or an impression. The truth is that friends, lifestyle and family are likely unchanged by even the strongest of fortunes. My feeling though is that there is some friction in considering the more genuine approach of 'living more' wherein we respect the fact that A) it earns the highest measure, and B) that other pursuits yield nothing more, effectively. Perhaps it is our troubled time that sees me fending of uncertainty and aspiration, and being less composed and settled into a way which is true and fitting. In some ways I believe we are still trying to make our world easier and approachable, differing only in how it is applied. "This does not seem necessary for personal action." I seek to work on things and invest my time and attention; how this varies is whether or not we are on our own or with other people. The measurable difference in what is appropriate to do is with respect to what is sought; this may come from foresight and ease of accomplishment, or be simply rooted into the limits of how much a certain amount of interest can produce. For example, if there were 100 of us then our hopes and ambitions would be large and substantial. With just me I seek writing, reflection, formation and treatment. In addition, with friends, does gaming, reviews and discussion likely follow. 'That is fine when I am set and happy in me."
    <br>&emsp;I would expand on this through a past point that being famous or successful (digitally let's say) would only allow you to do those personal things in a grander way. My feeling is that these inner treatments are being held back by the concern of what forgoing that infamy brings -with respect to newer efforts. Per our decisions I'd say that nothing more than true and genuine effort is of interest to me: everything past is born from self aggrandizement and importance, along with fear of missing out and or what we could otherwise achieve. Building on that prior point, will internet fame not yield you a friend. What we are best to do is earn more and be more through our genuine works and writing. Having friends will allow the formats of these to be more varied and abundant. The effect though is that if we become more prominent and impressive on the whole, then it is of what we are doing that more favorably earns attention. "In short, we want people to see our Sums so that more effort and interest can go in; people caring furthers my own value of it, which either sets me forward towards higher personal efforts, or ones that are equally larger but collaborative."
    <br>&emsp;This is crucial and worth addressing. The model works in the following way. Earn local trust and comradery so that more genuine efforts can be made; as firm as we are to this line will more abundance be produced, efficiently too, and thus an overall impression will be made. 'To Gondor We Go!' I say, in that we are preciously and vehemently striving along the lines of the effort and construction that I have made, and wish to expand upon and further cherish and say. This is solely in our control. Practically, if the reward that we seek comes from the impression of things that we are doing and wish to increasingly do, and the means to drawing this in is through more strong and sound abundance, then the goal of our deliberation and the path that marks the righteous way down our innermost road, is through comradery, friendship and personal acquaintances. Specifically, foreign folks may invest, but they be unable to initially build; for that we need a partner and friend (for strict and consistent sake). How this is achieved is marked within the lanes within our personal lives. People are met at work, at home, with nostalgia or remaining relations; with more benefit are those who you meet at more intimate and useful initiatives ie. workshops, classes, and internet use that reflects regional limits (to name a few). And in that case our best is in having something to bring. For one, will our closest influences give you the time, agreement, wilfulness and or support to continue developing and inquiring from the ground up; this paired with the prominence that we'd display in any of those outer events feels like the right path -where our promise comes from the influence placed upon others through our strongest propriety.

 <div id="whocares">
    Not only is it clear that there are people who are worse off than me, and that my own issues are hardly easy enough to come by as it is, but the world does not care. There is a mountain of infrastructure with all these uniquely tailored cogs, and no one is there to emphasize you. I feel that this is applicable in one's impact, in that only those who can muster the time and care to listen will do so, and moreover, will their spread of what they enjoyed only reach those who are interested in hearing from them. In short, everyone is doing something; moreso is there much less you could hope to achieve that was actually crucial for them. At best, your own inner activity could inspire others to do the same; if one's mind is set outward though, then the issue they've made is thinking that anyone other than those who have similarly errored, cared. There is just too much natural and demanding misfortunes to soundly believe that anyone really cares; that is why friendship is the finest, for someone can share what you wish to avoid and achieve.
    <br>&emsp;Another fact is that people in their younger years get sheltered from the world, forming views from their place within youthful institutions and relationships. The ordinance of this may lead itself well into the real world, but they are merely better at demonstrating themselves. The issue, for better or for worse, is that they don't acknowledge the inevitable wares of their living; as well, they still don't see how indifferent the world is, which contrasts their experience in those earlier ages. Still, they may do well in an artistic or skillful sense, but the value is only in the thing they're doing, rather than the impressions that they've made. "There is simply too much that goes on for everyone with a change of disposition(into maturity) that follows. That is why people don't rave when they're fifty: it runs contrary to their lives."
    <br>&emsp;The crux of this is that the world demands so much from you, both in order to basically stand, and forthright see. Because this is universal, it is not sound to think that anyone is any more than distantly observing(and possibly interested). Vanity should be removed, or devalued at least. We can make moves that are seen, or at least are done so in a more integral way that gives more developing chances that an impression will be made. First, we do our own best, wherein we live the most and form it well together; secondly, is you find someone who is also trying to live well, and therein is eligible to collaborate; in effect, the output of both of you will genuinely be that much more. Why this is good is that a friend is subject to the world in a comparable way. Because our resolve to this is one that is at most suspending over the draining whole of nature and her way, we can say that the very ability to share interests with one is lucky. Compared to kids who have groups and many friends, people amidst mature responsibilities and corresponding desires are outside any place where such sheltered comradery can occur. Neccasrily we should uphold ourselves: for we will not always have a friend, or otherwise be ineligible to be one for another. That marks the proper spot and what we should mold ourselves around and attend to. "Rather than thinking that passivity, ignorance and cheap action, will bring the busy eyes of others towards you; or better yet, that they are just waiting there for you already. Each compliments eachother as a whole of wrong."

 <div id="norms">
    A culture describes the customs and interests of a people. On a smaller scale, groups of friends or family, even a private society, have their own values and processes. Those latter though generally form either from or out of disdain from the norms within the former. In effect, my family is much like other families as are my friends; in that, the culture on the whole is largely adopted by people at those local scales. Moreso, do my close friends have less time and room to be separate from these norms; at heart they may wish to, and to our demise there was given confidence from me, yet to the current end there has been no differing prevail. Perhaps Seneca's quote of 'you must either remove yourself from or imitate the masses' has some worthwhile relevance here.
    <br>&emsp;Consider the following. To be remarkable one must hown themselves towards a greater path and corresponding result; this can not be done with complacency and irregularity. If a society around is in contrast to this, then one who wishes to be grandly different must effectively reform and bring forth themselves on their own -for you otherwise imitate the crowd. For the man to be happy though he needs value in his expression(and creation); what this amounts to is that the steps he puts forth and the generosity he has is invested with an abundance of attention and care. The issue though is that he can only care so much on his own, especially when you consider how much effort it already takes to be so generous. In that, the values from other people contribute a reciprocal caring of the subject in question. "An easy example is watching a sporting match by yourself compared to doing so in a crowd: the latter obviously increases the involvement and joy that each member has." Our concern though is what activities are we doing, even at the initial cost of being on our own. In addition, we care whether that time invested is substantially and consistent, rather than briefly on occasion. Looking at the sporting example, those games are only ever often, expensive too; moreover, do the goods that one gets from being involved leave you with nothing you can hold onto and later apply. You admittedly earn some relief and sustenance from being involved, but if another episode were not to happen any time soon, the present experience would not hold till then.
    <br>&emsp;Bringing it back, we as men of reason and goodness need to form ourselves so that our natural and constant step molds us permanently through the world. Our stance must remain once we receded back in the commons, wherein we'd prominently be shown and draw more in. Also worth noting is that our place as men of reason is not separate from those without; rather, we are only using our time within the world with more maturity and care. Effectively, this brings us away from dinner and events, but eventually leads us back into the everyday workings with more of a composed and admirable state. In other words, our actions will naturally be spent inside the world of man, in all his institutions and delights; however, we are not like those in the passive norms who get sucked into the indulgence and foolish pleasures far in front of those social offerings. Instead, we hang further back, bringing the goods of liberty and utility into our time of cultivation and production. If the world were more like this then we would not have to recede; as it stands, the bend of it is towards that front of greedy fun and excitement, and so we must bracingly oppose.
    <br>&emsp;My point, is that the developments of that reason and goodness will reach a prominent state wherein its extent meets the middle; I am not saying that those fools will ever see it, but those less recklessly inclined will be. As they say 'one man is a crowd, especially when he is in and from himself'. For that, we must take the time to reach the highest good, and maturely do so if private means are required. Then, will there be fans of the goods we provide; though, this is not onto us and our deliverance, rather onto the objects and interests that are revealed through our reason and greatness. To that, may others be compelled to be more composed and admirable themselves, to which the Man justly delights. "Then, all can make and see there own or others soaring towers."

 <div id="intolerable">
    One of my least favorite feelings is in regard to other people's perceived stupidity. What occurs is that I believe that the view from others is tilted in a way that reflects something starkly different from my own. Historically this has conjured itself as 'Game of Thrones' being a mark of what is true: and my dissatisfaction and resistance to the fact that other people would think it is. What bothers me is that the violence in the show is too much a mix of sharpness and putridity. People are subject to some of the worse things ever presented, and moreso is the depiction set within a well acted and realized world -which makes the experience ever more grim. The position I have on the show is that there is an understandable whiff of character and style. As a product that is meant to be aired and shown, the design of it and execution of it are in some ways at least pointed towards being entertaining. Moreover, would I say that even the greatness it has and where it is bold, reflects things that are entertaining 'because they are so good'.
    <br>&emsp;What I am troubled by, or rather personally in disagreement with, is that this sound depiction is both a measure and sound insight 'to the ways things are, and oh how bad did they use to be'. It is my discontent at others believing this to be true without any consideration that bugs me. It is a similar interjection as those who see a friend, or stranger for that matter, attest to psychics or a casual belief in god etc. -and your impulse is to deny their sentiment and insure a proper replacement. The question, is not whether Game of Thrones is completely accurate, or a warranted reference and measure for how we see the world -and are as such appreciative because ours is different. The point, is that although others may believe this to be true, and that this perceived error on their part may dishevel me personally, our own assessment is wrong. Foremost, are people not having such strictly reverent thoughts towards the prominence of Game of Thrones. First, if it is realistic in its violence, then it is better for the show, rather than exciting an insight to what the truth is. I could further say how the show is not actually erecting a dictated response to other people, or rather that it is not really a psychic swaying people to believe something that is not fully true, but I would be better off raising the thesis point of psychology in this case. Fundamentally, it is our own fear and corresponding sensitivity to other's ignorant proclivity, which evoke a clutching discontent -under the notion that they would see dramatic depiction as true.
    <br>&emsp;The resolve though, in this case, is not to settle the dispute of the impression in question, rather that we more accurately assess whether or not the world around us is so foolishly taken. The route of this is not so strictly whole. We have biases that root us towards reacting and acting in a certain way. It may be the case that some are easily fooled by psychics or take what they say on Tv without any concern of whats aside from the grain of salt; it is most worth noting however, that these actions are not of those who would otherwise be wise and perfect: it is your own misalignment that causes them to appear to be taken away. Personally, your inability to grasp things in an active manner leads to an exaggerated notion of how other people similarly resolve. The truth, is that they may be taken by the impression of a thing, or, may simply be ignorant and passive to it all: it is within the scope and setting of their own biases though. "Through our own ignorance of their actual faulty claim, we press too hard that they in fact have one, and fail to see that it is our own rotten sensitivities that hone our criticism to others. For I, in such a stupid state, struggle with such depictions, even though I know that they are merely dramatic devices. The grinding feeling that I have though, amidst our faulty ways, sees poorly placed empathy and personal isolation, regarding others and their apparent naivety." Better said, when my mind is calm and tranquil, then those chimeras of rapacious brutes -shown in such literary ways- fail to break my own skin, and thus there is no discontent that others would believe the same.

 <div id="course">
    The course of our lives are such that death will always find us. Be it in sports, an accident, sickness or war, our end is coming. Yet we act as though this is not so; for if someone said, regardless of the time till, that a certain date held this event, we'd dredd. "It would then become more readily and clearly apparent." In our youth though, or our younger adult years the time seems to be merely passing, into more that is. The days go and more of them come, and we and the world stay for the most part unchanged. And perhaps our strict place within this dynamic is what keeps us from peering our heads outside the channel. However, I would suggest that it is only when some time goes by that our natural condition rears its head, 'as if it were saying that things can not continue as they do'. What I mean is that being sensible will not come forward as the apparent expression, in one's ever common days. As those moments stack, and the repercussions of being senseless come to fruition, herein are changes made. Whether that is within a relationship, one's health, idleness, frivolity etc, the consequences of these(if negative) will reveal themself as unmanageable: whereupon you will have to make a change. This is why we all grow up, eventually, and admittedly to a small degree. But poor eating, drinking, aimlessness, thoughtlessness etc, bear their marks as conditions which cannot be unaddressed. And from those consequent stains do we at the very least do something other than that which obviously procured them. One of the key wonderings then, is why some people rather than others, make these notes, or pay attention rather, in a more immediate and substantial sense. "Why is it that drinking all day and being void of exercise strikes someone earlier than another as being unfavorable and fallacious?" It is quite hard to explain, or say at least.
    <br>&emsp;A mention here is worth our time. Some people, who do nothing that is, make the comment "I know what to do, I just dont know how to do it." I find this to be a pernicious statement, for two reasons. First, is that you assume that your knowledge of something is eligible prior to the actual use of it. "It's as if someone recommended a shortcut, and prior to actually seeing if it in fact was beneficial, you claimed it was. Better yet, you may assume that you now know a better way, but be unable to if your car was broken." In that case, what bothers me is the fatuous stance on which route they are being delayed. "It's as if their newfound blindness stopped them from seeing contradictories: as if those were in fact already true!" Secondly, and for the most part a practical case, is how when one imparts themself through some sort of action, knowledge is learned. This reflects that prior, or in other words experience builds firmness on some action or thing, but it is upon subsequent use and or participation that further definition is made. In that sense, you develop your view on things as you partake in them. The example would go like this: "I have been training for some time and things are going well. I am doing this sort of regiment and readily sticking towards: I am not making as good of gains though and I feel my interest slipping." In that case, the error is not in their resolve, rather their objective. For in doing something for such length of time, you would think, or at least recommend, that the regiment itself, or principles beneath, be developed and refined themselves. To me, this is the front our concerns, wherein even the heartiest of intentions fall prey to repetitive expressions; with the practical shortcomings being both a decreasing amount of interest and ineffective regard for kinks and or improvements in the course of action. "In other words, we ought to be more principled and adaptive, wherein progress is made with respect to the values that we seek; herein would we alternate our directives based on their delivery of the things we wish for. As they say, 'that an aim for fitness will bring the elements of that out if the actions set towards it are truly effective'. Therefore, we must avoid seeing some route or course for the thing it is, as our involvement will likely wain, as well as succumbing to the passing profits and burdens of mistake. We must simply be more thoughtful."
    <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, I see little in the way of friction or missed opportunity by way of those who are foolish around us. "If we are the prince of a dying kingdom, still we will inherit the funeral." And I am not seeing much in the way of what will take away from me as a consequence of what other people do. Rather, in seeing that their way of living is illdeliberate, then our own mind of doing so will not bring us together. This is what is tough. Not that our family's ill fortune will weigh on us, or that other people's irritable stupidity will actually ignite the world, rather that we on this island of strength and profundity will lack at most a friend. Yet I see in myself that our aim is not to acquire those measures with the aim of fueling our accompanying discontent and rigidity; rather, we would make our own amends, and set ourselves towards the care and needs of our own person, and in turn earn the rewards of doing so -therein setting the flag on the horizons of that line. "Hereforth do those men and woman who served their country and gave me the freedom and time to forever more be the greatest version of myself, I can. But not so that the spoils from their labor are improved. They already fought and died to give me everything I need." This is a country, of beauty and serviceable gains; I have all and am in more ways than not the same. Onto our end then it will be one where the ripe prominence of living is claimed; wherein the soil offered beneath our feet is turned into an orchard, by which we to will become gardeners. And let those worries that brought us to war bring us to a point where those apples are sold, and that those bushels and cider be enough for conflict not to ensure: for we are born and ready by virtue of our course being set, towards an end which routes itself into the point and place in which we are presently made. We will blossom like flowers, balloon like mid summer clouds, or happily pillow over like the death from mushrooms. "I sat with grandeur and strength that this is our course." Nothing more. And as our iron stake, we chisel what its for and towards. By the hilt of this claim and all the fortune that its sheath is provided, do we as the wielders need a target. And, like a piling eruption of liberty and stature, doth we come from the ground below in all its richness, into a mighty trunk of elm and oak, by which the branches are treated and the leaves are embroidered. "And herein does the nector lay." It will be place for living, a position that rests entirely on the grounds it so graciously received. And in being so appreciative will this place grow and look up, to the stars rather than tomorrow's business. This grove of treatment, attention and care, will serve us nothing, for we are already made. Instead, it will vessel our freedom into a mold which will brighten no further, 'for our current mind's eye, we are blinded'. For in freedom, all we can see. "And we are already there."
 </div>
 <div id="anevenroad">
    For all my life the sun will rise and set, and the moon will come along too. Every 6 months the magnitude of its rise will either gradually settle away, or grow towards. Moreso, do I suspect that our children’s lives will be the same. It is possible that in several hundred years, that desirable space travel is more or less commercial. But for now in this modern age, the earth will do. Moreover, is this just fine. Where else can you find great trees, grass of green, sky of clear and breezy blue. I am not sure. But let’s be clear on something though. Just as our planet has its variety of flavors, so too would another planet’s elements fit inside that roster. Better said, if we were all shades of desert and jungle, and another rock(so to speak) held not but ice and snow, these would together make a summary of palatable sceneries; and the point is that in any of those cases, that none is more necessary than the other. “As it goes, the comfort in food is both in the eating and flavor; but it is in the nourishment and satiation that we seek, of which not but the refined can fail to meet.” In that sense, our planet may in fact have the only pieces of the palate, or there may be others too, but a palette is there no less regardless of where each specific is located. “Apples on Mars bear vitamins and citrus as well as oranges on the coast of Spain.”
    <br>&emsp;Now, if there were a war in America, and there was land that was free on Jupiter, then obviously one would be more favorable. What we can not mistake ourselves in doing, is seeing that latter as any different than another country on earth which is equally hospitable. Since our living is generally on a smaller scale, then the area in which we lived, in Argentina for example, is effectively the same as a similarly warless state of Jupiter. “The error being that Jupiter would be seen as a whole.” This is impractical, but ultimately insignificant, for if it were a massive state by itself, the value of ‘states’ and their present proclivity for war(or any suffering for that matter), would be the determining factor for our choices, as well as what we would look towards and be grateful for.
    <br>&emsp;The reason I think this way, or try and attempt to at least, is that it helps to understand, and fully articulate mind you, that each and all is the same. Why this is, simply rests on the fact that either A) we were not actionable or conscious enough to worry or care, and thus our living did not deliberately matter; or B) we are of that rational kind, or one with forethought and industry etc, and if so then it is the experience that we have that matters most, and therein the scale by which we measure our discipline and grace. In other words, our actions will bring us towards a certain way, and in being aware of this we take comfort in knowing that it will be to a positive end. Having learned that all is the same, renders off the fat so to speak, or in other words trims the faulty and mistaken impressions of what is desirable and to be avoided. “Our life is in front of us and our choice in how we proceed, and therefore what we can anticipate gaining, is very susceptible to apprehension and dissatisfaction: for our expectations were either not met, or in any case dreadful on approach -by virtue of our apprehension.” The truth in all this is that living will always be our claim. Less we be dead, or of those general kinds who have not yet been born, living will be our way. And with that being the case, would good living seem the best. Moreover, would the ripest and soundest kind of experience which this good living amounted to, be most positive when it was substantial and consistent. By that token, those who are masochistic, despite preferring the inflicted pain, may not enjoy other delights, or at least not to any given extent. In contrast, those of a devout or simply principled kind, may fear for not and actually enjoy the world in total. In that case, their kind of living carries some strength as the one which is best amended too; at least this is accurately so if it does in fact provide the regular abundance we seek.
    <br>&emsp;There is a line to be clear, that being the place where specifics come into play. For we can see things which are clearly unsuitable within that sort of living, and thus require little detail or thought from us. What about our careers though, or our families? What do these suggest we do considering that scale? If we want our life to be enriched and lasting, does a child at 20, marriage at 22 and mortgage at 23 feel appropriate? I’m not saying it isn’t, but seeing as the heart of this is complex, our scale demands that we think in a particular sense, or clearly that is. For, in that example, would the results of having that child and family at that period in life, not be obvious in terms of what the effect will be through the years to come? And I must be astute here by saying that if, upon thinking about it and determining a more thought out course, that this direction is desirable and well founded, then good, go for it of; just don’t forgo thinking of it at all, for there may be limitations and overestimates in turns of what is actually on offer. “And one would be quite foolish to ignore those facts, or forgo inquiring about them to begin with.”  
    <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, it is easy to accept that friends, a spouse, a child or a home, will be significant in the rewards they offer. And I don’t mean to suggest that they won’t be enough, but there is a worthwhile insight into the kinds of pleasure that they bring. Having a child is exciting, as is getting married. Once the novelty wears off though, then you are stuck with the reality of it. And sure, it is not like it was while you were expecting it, nor was it like it was in that golden period; but still, comfort, security, clarity, support, warmth, a home, are all there. Moreso, is it generally consistent that these things would be the case. In short, besides any other sorts of living and the pleasures those can bring, choosing this path is as good as any of them. But I would like to draw a comparison, or at least highlight another less clear example. Let’s say you discovered the principal element of the world. It had you up writing and engaged for weeks on end, and more than that had the time leading up to it been wholesome and plump, whilst the weeks that followed saw even more effort of the kind -however light in comparison. First, we can say that this sort of experience is different from those more civil and or familial pleasures. As I said, the value there is in the support and warmth that the scenario brings. Whereas you can see in this creatively indulgent case, that the richness of the experience is made by one’s investment; by that token, in comparison to those other values, we could say that what is pleasurable here is the expression of creativity, contribution, generosity, craftsmanship, industry and worldly love.  
    <br>&emsp;Now, this isn’t to say that people don’t enjoy the generosity imparted onto their families; moreover, does a creative person, or one who is especially so, not necessarily lack any places or spots of comparable comfort and warmth. The key then, is where the emphasis is placed. People don’t like to be thrown at by others; in fact they find it intrusive and overwhelming -like they’re being clinged on to. Whereas an artist may in fact earn some credit and care from another sibling or friend, but the nature of their work is one that generally separates them. The point being, that our life’s route will draw out certain aspects and give them more emphasis when compared to others; none be barred up or strictly absent, but time and attention can only be spread so much. My point is that depending on what sort of experience you wish to have, be it bent towards immediate living and fruitful construction, or that of a warm and secure life, really is up to you. Forgetting to determine what things amount to though, as well as what scale you have to measure by, indicates that an unfavorable result will happen in whichever case; or, at the very least, that whatever good you do have, will gradually slip away -whilst things of a comparably bad magnitude, will similarly trickle in. “And what stake would be worth it to have, if its end saw you absent of one and its gains? That, it seems, is the definition of efforts which are vain.” Let’s get detailed. When it comes to genuine highs, artistry and contribution will provide these more often than social settings and typical fortune. There are surely moments in that latter that reach further than the peaks of that former, but the median line of the former is generally higher. However, the lows of this artist are more common as they may simply lack a friend; though, the conflict and fear of loss within those holding hands, may make the peaks of the other comparably high -in this lower case. “Better said, fighting occurs little between a man and his brush.” He still lacks warmth though; or, at the very least, he would be fortunate in his own right to have a partner or friend that fits effectively within his personal kind of life. The point, is not that we will choose one or the other, but that in all aspects we will do them well. And moreso, that we will root ourselves into the side that we lean, and accept any other shortcomings -with natural progression and worthwhile fortitude in mind(as the good from the other side justifies any other lackings). Personally, I see a lot of families who lose their warmth and lack any creativity at all. I do see a lot of artists who are not so fulfilled, but this seems to me because they are not fully artists. “A creative person lives their life with respect to the world, and in the means by which they express the feelings drawn from the impression of it.” This is a very fulfilling thing to do, but requires that you put yourself into it; otherwise, you will get little from it, and be stuck with the little earnings from that contrary route.  
    <br>&emsp;In plain terms, I just see much more living actually being done by those who are being consistently and elaborately generous. The good from family is both in the warmth offered, and on offer. And admittedly the artist may get burnt out from time to time, or just by consequence from the passing days feel cold deep inside; their running is more substantial though, and their heart beats with solidity and pure passion, with duration too. “I just feel like the glow of my family and friends is to suttle, amounting to at most comfort. It doesn’t give me anything to do, or rightly that is.” Fundamentally, people are extensions of ourselves. “As if we were playing soccer together, or juggling on our own.” The actions we participate in, and our general place in the world, is for the most part objective, in the sense that it wraps itself around us, be it as one, as comrades or in a group. The details here are a real match for me then, momentarily at least; that is, if I seek to distinguish a family who does little, with a centered man who does alot, then I am in need of the energy to do so, well that is.  
    <br>&emsp;I think what I mean to say overall, is that whether we are alone -be it within our regard, or lonesome- or with a family, friendship or some friends, that it is within the world that we express ourselves, as one or together. And my only point, is that those things in the world are objective to us; they do not become more permissible because the bar for what is consequential is lowered through the fortune of your family; moreover, does your solo condition not render you in chains to those things which would otherwise be ripe and fruitful. A good illustration will offer the point. If one were to see the sun, and feel merry and cheer as it went about its way, so too would another friend by your side increase the enjoyment of this experience; wherein you would say it was a welcome accompaniment. This is referred to as friendship, in that you share intrigue and delight in what is good, and an equal amount of restraint and respect for what is unfavorable and bad. What if there is a friend, or group of people for that matter, that besides any condemnation for you being so gayly enthused, simply offered no interest themselves? How is this sharing? The question then is whether it is better to do these rich and grander things on your own, or to drink, belch, ignore, comment, criticize, argue, suppose, and generally be inequitable and tiring, simply because that is where you can share something in the presence of friends. “How valuable are people when the time you spend together is of the sort that it would not suffice by yourself?” I personally believe that what is good for me is equal to that which upon an ally, merely improves it. Because for me, the only thing that wavers in being so impressed by the green of this world is not our satisfaction or mind, but the ease and regularity in which I do it. For it legitimately would be more accessible and significant if I did have a friend. I only seek one of mine though, in that they should be a friend to me. “And thus there is no room for me to share anything else, even if this means that our experience is merely our own to contend.”
 </div>
 <div id="thegood">
    If we have family and friends, then two things are true. One, is that the improvement is to those things in the world. These are what require our amendment and respect, whether it is for civil, fortuned, leisurely or studious gain. Secondly though, is that these objectives are the same whether you are with friends or on your own. Where they differ is in which ones you adhere to, but onto that thing which you would, is the same. Now, I must preface this by saying that ideals are not meant to disown those who are uncongenial towards them during our current thinking; put another way, if someone is with family and relations that bolt them down and away from higher living, then our suggestion regarding ideals is not that this situation should be removed. Rather, as most aims do, it provides clarity and bearing, as to helm one's action further down a certain path compared to the other.
    <br>&emsp;In any case, it seems that our effort and life is best when that world surrounding us is best set upon. That means that drugs, cakes, argumentativeness, stillness, poor ambition and raught tradition, hamper those in all scenarios. The man, lets say, whose aim is in artistry, bears not these claims, for their action and intent is coalesced into a mix of enriched impressions and the accompanying resolve(of generosity that is); whereas those amidst other people may have less trajectory towards the positive end of this world, despite their fortunes nearby. If, for example, someone has a far stretching amount of friends which keeps them busy and engaged, then I say well on. But lacking any significant place in the whole of the world, through creation that is and principal, seems lacking on their part. That is not to say there is no good having a few close friends and a world made of others, but the consistency and abundance of joy, rest, right anticipation and admirable conduct, may come short. Let's be clear that my aim here is not to condemn those who lack peace and enriched happiness throughout their day, but I fear little to explain their lacking of such as a consequence to both their absence from the world in the relevant way, and their otherwise roots within the presence of other people -who are not poor themselves for being there in regards to satisfaction- but may not(and are likely so) not of any differing state as our subject, which in consequence sees them all with some other who is equally void from the world.
    <br>&emsp;What I mean by the world is action. And looking at our days there are moments throughout where they can be of a brilliant kind. Our judgment here is merely an ideal one. I don't propose that having good friends and a common life is vehemently poor, or that those who are lacking in both another and themselves, are not the worse of the two. But onto that scale of what is most positive, neither compete. A point then is worth bringing up. Simply, we can distinguish the degree to which something is good or bad, and value them accordingly, 'but we must have an equally firm taste for goodness itself, just as we must have an equal distaste for all badness itself.' In other words, my belief is that living consistently throughout the day, and regularly so, holds the most good, whereas comfort, security, thrills and fun are less good, and in some cases bad.
    <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, we are henceforth looking for the good, and increasingly so. And, to reiterate, will we say that despite any moments of it being present -as this can be the case in almost any sort of scenario- that we'll anticipate and hope for a true constance of it, enriched too. In that sense, there is reason to declutter poor estimates we have regarding the world, seeing as that space is where your expression finds itself. One reason that friends and people are lacking, is that your training, sleep, food, reading, film interest, story experiences and writing, bear no social setting; in those cases, we are truly on our own -with friends offering at best a warming glow. In regards to our view on the world then, we can see that its draw on us is mixed, that being whether we do something as one or together. The point being, that in a group or on your own, your actions place themselves to objects -which is what we refer to as the world. And which ones we choose, and in which way we act upon them, determines the heart of our lives. And I feel like I'm assuming little that those prior actions are either necessary or for benefits. Seeing as they are things done by yourself, does not exempt one from simply having friends, and only participating in actions according to that. "For our feet may have great itinerary and roots for fun, but not for lasting joy or rest, if those prior efforts are forgone." Our life needs to be more rounded than that. One thing to note, is that what we mean by consistent and abundant good, is that joy, rest, peace, tranquil and dreamless sleep, firm posture and breath, ill restlessness, avoidance of anxiety and stress, and no apprehension or grueling regrets, are each provided in their corresponding ways. Since our actions in the world will return us the sum of this experience, it gives merit to choosing the right things to do in that world; or better put, that there is some good in our objectives -if we want this favorable result.
    <br>&emsp;What is causing me to restep and tread on my heels, is that it is unclear what a normal person really ends up doing. Let us just say that with the support of others, they enact themselves onto the world, for both fun, principal and profession, and be it to other people, institutions, nature or activity. I simply feel that if certain things are lacking, or in some way lacking emphasis, then one's objective rewards will be more hollow and poor. Again, it is that register of aspects that mix together to become a lastingly good experience. This is our utmost scale. And rather than recommend which things one ought to do, we can at least say that per one’s bearing and proclivity to receive, that an object's impression and reward will itself be objective. In that sense, I mean that our judgment will have to be imparted, and measured against that foremost scale. All I mean is that if you want to do these certain things, or that those things lacking are o.k to you, then be clear that this being the case will have its objective effects. Donuts not being in your life will remove the effect from donuts, just as writing consistently will bear the effect from writing. "Regardless of what you prefer and deem suitable, know that the way things are, is in an objective place, aside from your view of them lets say. Be at least clear on that."
    <br>&emsp;Less our judgment has some place, and considering that we are otherwise on our own -in both the acceptance of good and bad- then a tautology is the only explanation. That is, things will do this on account of the particular thing: if this is good or bad, use your judgment, whilst remembering that things will have their objective effects. In that sense, the point is that being clear on what those effects will be, and what your values are, are strictly important by virtue of 'some effect surely happening at all'. And I could suggest what is good on account of my own judgment, or be impartial and say that one should be thoughtful and discerning by themselves. For one, my ability to give recommendations is resisted by that fact, that my advice is out of place and not mine to give. "Where I might otherwise plead that one is careful, or cautious." Being a writer though my thoughts have open reign, and are looking for clarity of their own; thus, I may attempt to be ostensibly suggestive for the sake of mending our own thinking. Another limitation grows though, in that being objective as to what things we should do is simply a hard thing to say. Again, in reiteration, my kindred passivity roots itself tautologically, in that I would prompt someone to be thoughtful about themselves on the basis that things will act on you as they do; the point being that your admission and resolve to any which thing should not be without initial discernment. In our writing though, or if we are actually giving forward advice, requires that we mold the world and our general lives, as to extract some sort of principle or law, which by itself indicates what we are congenial towards. I could distinguish the two approaches in that the first was hopeful and passing, whereas the latter is more direct, but merely based on strength and likelihood. For that to be so, our casing of the world can only be sufficient if the specifics on offer dangle from above. "For if we start with those, then the expense will be holes in our frame." We can thicken it though, the frame that is. We are all people, and mortal as such. Moreover, will food, sleep, responsibility and the future always be on our plate. Additionally, does our self regard give some credit to the fact that actions and good living are truly sought for at all. In fact, we can mix in the value of what's most positive as a fundamental aspect regarding our existence. "In some ways, this is true and warranted by virtue of us asking at all -for it suggests the place of an appropriate way to be."
    <br>&emsp;What we are trying to achieve is a suitable mold. This is not in it required that everyone else's life is accounted for, or that they would(if so) listen. I am personally trying to have a better target and grasp when it comes to living our best. So, we will begin by encompassing ourselves to the world; moreso, will we draw borders around it -in a national sense- but that of states and cities too. The former does have its literal restrictions, whilst the other is for our regards as to placement, but each rests on the fact that we are either A) somewhere local, and B) without imposition to be in any given locale, seeing as there are plenty where we can be. Now, these positions that we are in have similar elements; those being civil rules and services, familial rules and services, right and wrong ambitions, and our foremost place for activity. Across these, there is a sentiment of regard that ranges from 'what we have to do, and what will earn us more from doing so, or make it easier to accomplish, and that this is what we seek, and how we can do so more often, and to a higher degree'. This for the most part is sufficient for me to explain what one ought to do. I'll be clear, that I am in fact only trying to say what I ought to do, but in the sense that if someone were the same then our advice to one another would equally fit, and being able to consider the time and place for more than just one feels more approachable. To be clear, I am aware that people have different environments, hopes, fears and positions and that none will ever be the same. It is our understanding though which we seek to further, the aim of which is bettering the guide which orients us as to choose better and end up better within that respective life. "In that I earn more from seeing those around me as comparable. Or at least it smoothes our thinking to imagine so."
    <br>&emsp;Something not unimportant, is that we are merely trying to understand. Our goal as stated, is to simply reach a point where the flow of our life is without reckless distaste or ambition, and rather filled with rest, tranquility, richness and joy. People, bring this out in us, in both the company we have in our enjoyment, as well as increasing the value of the thing at hand. Their effect can be opposite though, in that important things are given less value, or at the very least their enjoyment is lessened in the presence of certain people; or, they detract from your value of important things, and instead encourage and or praise your efforts toward worse ends. My goal is to simply say that our life has a bearing, is improved upon with people, muddied by their presence when it's unsuitable for that aim, and overall that our best is when we further reach this way. That is all. Now, comfort and stability come into question here, as one may say 'what, you don't have a girlfriend, a career, a posse of sorts!', and I say "yes, I truly don't, and moreover do I wish I did. But I will not substitute a version of those things for a shortening of these things which I currently have". Furthermore, would I state and affirm the fact that all who are then good and congenial to me and this rightful way, will come about and join our path, take part in it at least, as long as we walk it. And either A) I have only begun, or B) have been going and have not crossed another suitable for this lane. In that though, I would plead that pity not be placed, for the good at the end of this trail is drawing enough, so much that even without a friend I am carried by it.
    <br>&emsp;All in all, we are left to bear what choices we have made; and, to reiterate, that even choosing well is enough to fill it up, regardless if the ends have come to fruition. "Doing what we feel to be right is ample enough to keep us encouraged and satisfied. For we feel like we're going somewhere born out of that foremost stake." Moreso, does that underlying wish for warmth and security -and its tendency to prevail- assure us that when it comes, it will be towards and in congruence with this better end. In contrast to this are those moments of gluttonous and idle regret, where being overly comfortable at the expense of firmness and application hollows one out, and makes them feel as if they were at best stirring, rather than being truly alive. And so we can build on that by saying that each of our aims are upward, and to whichever path we are brought, and whomever and whatever comes along or misses the way, that we can all accept and kindly agree that each may learn their own, but equally assume and be privy to the disdain of things which are poor in themselves, only that those who partake in them are not the objects of that contempt - only the results(or states) which reflect the dimness of our heart. So be poor or rich, I care not. But you are a man, or a person rather, and that means the regard for myself includes you both in my desires as well as where the scale in which I'd employ applies to. "You are relevant and suitable for my wholesome discrepancy." Again though, if you fail to meet these standards, or find truth elsewhere, Ok. But to those things which I view as bad, will my judgment remain.
    <div class="qu">No matter our differences we are still kindred and cordial, communal too at heart. We may simply walk apart. "But your home shares the same soil as mine. Grow as you please, but frett not if I nevertheless see you as a gardener, as I."</div>
    Let us summarize, for there is a crucial detail that needs reminding. On the whole, and generally I might add(considering the type of thing we are), that what is good is that which we are best to move towards -and more or less end up at. Now, what this is, firstly at least, is not particular or objective; rather, we can say that to whichever good(and corresponding end) this would be, that positivity is ubiquitous to any kind -of outcome that is. Now, this may be of an indifferent sort, as in the ways of a sheep or rock, but when it comes to Man, or at least one who is deliberate, then the end for us should reflect that. In effect, our actions are like those of the former, only done so with more huff and gust, and forethought to, as if we had planned for it and sought for a higher being within it. "As if we were acting for sake of the actions themselves." Whereas a deer may be compelled towards its good of running away from wolves or nibbling on shrubs, but without much care or attention as to what they're doing -by virtue of their baser nature merely bringing them along towards what is appropriate for survival. What is suitable for us, or at least where we are in contrast becoming more congenial towards, is actions that are good in themselves. This means that we seek the warmth of a spouse or joy of a friend, not for the benefit later on, but because it is what is worthwhile right now. And, as our kind of nature reflects, would thinking about this being the case, and deliberately addressing which things were appropriate for that, would not only garnish us with a self respect and ease as results from trying to live well, or good that is, but actually conferring the benefit and gain that we currently seek -by virtue of targeted intent.
    <br>&emsp;The question as always then, is whether there is any good in particular things in a universal sense, or is it specific to the subject. Of varying kinds sure, as a Dolphin enjoys jumping through the water, it also doesn't care to read. We on the other hand, have our own common proclivities and or tendencies which reflect, that which when applied, returns the greatest living. What I mean to clarify then, is that however unobjective we can be onto which objects are good, we can at least be honest and admit to the attributes associated with the result that any favorable action of ours would have. Again, this is based on the fact that, however varied in peculiar aspects and or scenarios, that our heart and bones(so to speak), or at the very least the roots of being cognitive and(more or less) industrious), does suggest that to whichever particular end of, that between us all they'll be comparably the same. In that sense, be it of family and friends, crafts and study, ambition or philanthropy etc., that each would be seen as good(in the result) if the following sorts of elements were present. Joy should be there, as something contrary to this is literally explained as something you don't enjoy doing. Rest should similarly follow, as being restless upon completion suggests that either something more will have to be done, or at the very least the current session fails at being fulfilling -for if it were, you would be pleased(with joy), but then able to rest(as if you were satisfied). In addition, the means by which you experience these things should not go against the other; drinking and parties are fun, and generally are full of enjoyment -little rest is on offer though, upon finishing that is. On top of that, would responsibility, your ability to participate in things that were good themselves, or one's strength in avoiding which was bad, will to our doom falter, leaving us with not but hopeful dreams and intent -as we wish to return to a point of action that left us without debts. Another important thing is that what we are doing should give us commendment of ourselves, as if upon thinking about it, or at least having thought about it before, measures up to what we believe is good to be. "If we set out to lose weight and later on noticed that we had, or were otherwise in the process of exercising, then by noticing this we are bringing ourselves to a more respectful position, personally. In contrast, had we stopped training, or noticed that our effect within it had been worse than we'd expected, then our pride is consequently dampened. Accordingly, we will not only feel poor and little, but discouraged too, which confers even more detriment as further good grows increasingly distant."
    <br>&emsp;As a fuller picture, I can say at the back -where more base actions are done, such as training, eating, deliberating- ought to be beneficial in a positive sense, but also void of negative effects when it comes to sleep, breathing, posture, walking, stretching, labor and common discourse. By that latter I mean that our actions don't produce future moments of shortness and irritability, rather that our success within those wholesome gains would give us the ability to listen more, endure through stress and ill fortune, or simply be patient, thoughtful and kind. Moreover, when it comes to those former elements of health and well being, that their consistency in being experienced bears the soundest mark, or measure that is, by which separate actions are judged by. "And again, drink all you will, but if your sleep seeps into detriment, and increasingly to, then that is for you to contend with -while you otherwise drink. To which end you will sacrifice, the choice is yours." The other end of this fuller portrait reflects the prominent aspects of your life. General content and happiness is good, but it swirls a bit inside the middle. What we are addressing are those moments, and corresponding activities, that see you drawn and engaged, lastingly to, and leave you with not but a feeling of richness and accomplishment. These activities range from study and writing, specialized training and recreation, particular interests in TV and Film, fun and immersion of games(from shooters to Sim), and if fortune bears us the claim, a sincerely well founded discussion. To me, these all amount to the peaks of our lives. They are not in themselves sex, or drugs, or momentary relief and excitement, rather they are things which abundantly you actually do, and embroider you with a feeling that you have lived and produced. "Those former experiences are admittedly pleasurable, but their effect is generally passing. Whereas these latter leave you feeling full for a comparably higher time. Not only that, but you have much clearer, strong, deep and commendable views of where your action will go next. While those previous lot leave you feeling a little dirty and hollow. 'That is why they call it finishing'." Wrapping these two sides together, are those baser actions and their aim of constant and easy solidity, with those in front, who live off of that ground, blossoming like flowers gifted with the grace of good roots and nourishing soil. In some ways then, our attention really should be onto that foundation, for it is where our living is built from; it is only of a formative kind though, as those forward actions need their own design and admiration -as to be clear and able to use the energy at hand, as well as being resolute and staked on their goodness, as we might otherwise see our ability better spent towards experiencing cheap thrills and short lived pleasures. "Whereas these and their total sum of widespread living, is a lasting one, and increasingly prominent too." That is the whole of it.
    <div class="qu">I don't mean for this measure to be aimed at scrutiny or harsh judgment; I am merely including those who I consider equal in relevance to the understanding which I seek to have. I only bring others into the question because it allows me to advance more effectively towards the truth: the only intent is for me to use it though. And in that case, for me personally at least, do I fear not that others would beguile me as to their inclusion in my assessment, or that they would treat me with their own harshness because this was the understanding that I had. I simply suspect that in being this way, and resolutely too by virtue of who I am, that none will be there to share it with, or to further learn, explore, develop and enjoy. And seeing as this attempt of mine is a legacy one at this point, you can see why my current steps to further advance are so severe and astute. "For the end, in effect, which they mean to promote, is one that must carry us by itself: who else would be there to share it?"</div>

 <div id="suitableconduct">
    The good is in proper action; that is, within an operation there is appropriate conduct within the matter. So, in a scenario of piety, prudence and grace are good in that they are in line with what piety requires. A better example is in skilled labor, in that a machine or device has a proper way of using it; whereupon doing so, or failing to and stumbling, would the former be commentated on as ‘Good’, whilst the latter would confer ‘try again’ -as to avoid saying that was bad. Secondly, in summary, are the investigations of the machines themselves. Note, that our preferred outcome is one thing with respect to the total of all things, but we can say that an oven, for example, has the aim of baking, of which the act of doing so well will be good for this. The point then, is how do we know what baking needs, or is in the first place. This, as I would generally suppose, calls on the means of science, wherein an object’s identity and possible purpose is brought into question. So if we had a large iron blade, a sharp piece of metal that is, then its use could be of military or decorative kinds. Now, to reiterate, whether one should be done over the other requires a higher understanding of what things one ought to generally do; in this case, we are merely explaining that in either use case, this is how the object could be appropriately used. And I would say that we can base these illustrations on the fact that we are creatures of utility. “We are not making the mold for reality as to make the forms act and arrange, rather we are trying to see how things are in themselves, by virtue of our opportunistic curiosity.”
    <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, through analysis we can see the use of the blade. At the very least we can say its operations are derived as such as they appear with relevance to us. “For a pile of gold might otherwise be viable as a paperweight. ‘Though King Midas may himself seek an opportunity with that.” In this scenario, we could describe how our tools of analysis were merely such, in terms of what’s useful, by further understanding what a thing was in order to see what it did. Two thoughts come to mind. One, is that by being more detailed and focused, on the sword let’s say, then we may become more capable in wielding the sword(by the use case) as well as employing our construct capacities to a greater effect(by our resourceful mean). Secondly though, we may discover that its main component was iron, and that it itself can be smelted into other use cases. In that sense, by virtue of our curious nature, an analysis aimed at bettering our use of an object, may in fact allow us to perform and or manufacture other objects. A good example is the lightbulb, whereby its benefit from lighting our nights, also saw further understandings of how light worked itself. Consequently, direct advances in electronics were derived, as were accompanying advancements in engineering and physics.
    <br>&emsp;To bring this to an end, we can say that beneath the proper use of an item, or the proper display within an operation, is the understanding of what the conduct is, what would be useful to us when we operate, as well as alternative devices and or routes that become beneficial themselves. Herein though have we reached our limit. Or mine at least as we’ll say. For at this point can I only decipher and explain the metrics of desire and avoidance seemingly conducive to us as people, but an objective measure seems otherwise a challenge to claim. I wonder though if there either is one, or one that we would find useful or consequential, compared to that earlier sentiment that we could say sufficiently defines what is good for us -as we would commonly expect as people. “Perhaps the lord’s aims are other.” But if we do not know that truly, then would the reach of our opportune casing not mark the point of sufficient regard. ‘Wherein all that sat beneath did so with proper respect for what they are bent towards doing, to which we could then soundly amend?”

 <div id="theprince">
    I figure that as we proceed, our outcome will be the same. This is why, in fact, they say excitement throws us off before something actually happens, for in anticipating it we become restless and fearful whether we can make it happen, or that it will occur at all. Seeing what you like is fine, but merely as a natural end to our wavering conditions; that is, as we go through our days, and have time that is full of hopeful energy or that of idol daydreaming, we think of the time ahead. And letting yourself do so is fine, but remember to come back to where you are. "Otherwise, you will dredd over every detail to an unproductive degree."
    <br>&emsp;Now, it's not that those events call for little, and that knowing more precisely how their various elements will be tended to is unimportant, but the event itself is not part of our action, now at least. This is because these future happenings are usually the result of some choice, a resolve no less. And again, thinking over what that choice will be or how its important aspects can be dealt with, is not itself unimportant. But there is no choice right now. And if you figure that an accompanying amount of aims, privilege, fortune, grace, appreciation, congruence and or indifference sits beside our eventual chance to proceed, then you can see that the simple act of choosing fares no difficulty at all. "Both in terms of what it asks, and what struggle there is in terms of what we need it to do."
    <br>&emsp;Lets say we mean to move, to a new house that is at some point ahead. In our case, the amendment will simply be to move, and get through the logistics of choosing where to go. Getting there will be simple, as will the road ahead from getting there. Looking for homes then is not unimportant, but only relevant when you get to that point of looking. And surely, the selection will be smaller than if you were there locally -as you will have to virtually call. But, remember, that our skill, persistence, freedom beforehand and ease upon arrival will level the lands around this predicament, so much so that the widely applicable measure for success will be met. And then were there.
    <br>&emsp;My point, is that you can choose to do this now, and moreover do we not know when it would be preferable or beneficial to do so. As it stands, our life is just standing, growing an inch or two every day. If we simply show up, then our place here will be lasting as well as our eventual return. From that, there seems less worry required about a plausible choice, admittedly, but one that bears little impact in what it requires and affords. And seeing as all is in most practically, if not strictly at the moment the same, then we are better off and fine to currently be. And to that, do I sit here progressing, tuned, and tailoring our strength; moreso, do our aims that run from this sit as mere targets and guidelines, as to bring our ever advancing place into a more subsequent and favorable direction. If we look at all that we wish to write, as well as our leisurely interests beside, then we can be happy that our only expectation is to properly show up. "For the practice within this developing state, prompts us to partake in the interests we have so long as we are present and able. And our goal then and care, is in being prepped and ready to arrive at that." And there is no room to worry about voicechat, the simplest of bills and formality, and the even easier process of moving(once clarity is cemented).
 </div>
 <div id="outcome">
    The fact that the world will go round and round is merely a garnish to the fact that every position is the same. This is because in terms of what we seek, and what really withholds us, simply reflects the cold and warmth of our days. Most other scenarios are passing ones, or those which we impart on ourselves. "The only real difference is where we are in the rotation; whilst those other misfortunes are mere moments of inconvenience: for we generally overcome it, see it for something lighter, or simply move on and take our following steps ahead." It seems appropriate then that we would not bank our life as though any of it will change. Now, transferring our placement in the world does bear excitement, 'but only will a subsequent change bring you to a point that is any different than where you left'. What you will find is that all contention and doubt, and criticism for that matter, comes down to comforting our place when aims and principle are lacking. Assuming those goals were sound, then we could see how their foundation within natural tribute and care, sees no particular place required -by virtue of the majority influences (of the moon, stars, clouds and sun), being relatively constant in what they provide(necessary in the smallest case). Herein, if the world is generally all the same, or within the variety still offering the same quality(regardless of flavor), then our position bears no real worth so long as we have values, interests, objectives, ambition, resolve, attention, generosity, strength and care; moreso, that it was directed at and deliberated on to a scenario which has no borders or bounds, or better said, that our purpose is not suitable in one place over the other, 'as we are everywhere that we go, in which the catalyst for our living is brought and glows'. "And this light simply asks for a canvas, of which there is plenty -for treatment by the indifferent giver to that is." Nowhere can we improve. Fortune can offer different tastes, and generally there is an acceptable stance on our own infidelity and the wishes that correspond with the relief of that, but there is no other principal way. "These alternatives of gold and travelers fortune are mere dressings to an otherwise ubiquitous core; in there, doth we dredd ourselves if our heart is not bent or reverent to that lane, and moreso then will those additions be but mere seasoning, rather than any bulk or grain."
    <br>&emsp;Self regard is an important feature of this, as we typically come from a place in which virtue and justice were absent. Par for the course, is a result wherein one's personal attention brings them to a point where the aims of their prior state are seemingly achievable. In other words, we become wise as we fall in line with the world, but in effect become more capable. Moreover, as we cement ourselves into this way and 'add some meat to this righteous bone', so does our product and creativity. Therein, does our prior roots of ambition, as well as the pressure of being so prudent and astute, migrate our interests towards reliefs and success of that lower sort. "Wherein we spend our new founded pure tradition, on comparably lecherous ends." What I would suggest then instead, is to come to terms and develop a grasp on who you actually mean to be. For fortune will come, and prospects are never far away. But we must not see those as the world; and moreso, must we not confuse their respective promise as some end which is more comforting and exciting, yet admirable. Put another way, as ones who have their heads underground, in search of ourselves and our re-establishment we must not confuse more dazzling objectives for ones that upon our own righteous use, would in fact be proper. "For in our efforts as men, we become so only through cultivating it; and if we see other spots for employment as suitable 'because we as the greats are now placed in them', will only see that the gains of those formative efforts sizzle away."
    <div class="qu">In other words, acts for men must be sought for and seen as what they are with respect to what is appropriately mature. Whereas those of boys, ought to be seen accordingly similar</div>
    Nevertheless, the point was that on our path to be more pure and stout, ought we regard ourselves in such light, and reflect on who we are and what we seek to do in context of that. In some ways, I personally see the fact that our life is readily setting itself in front of me. And again, I am aware of future credits, or expected fortunes, but there is really just the year ahead. Any farther than that, and I can only see that stretch of time where we are on our own: in which our current principal grants us the simplest of sufficiency. "So I am just to simply show up." Coming back to that point, and building on this as an example, can I see what is next and how I'd like it to be. "But I see very little that is required for anything right to come around at all." In fact, instead of making the error of staying inside the hypothetical goods that you engage with, simply think about these things for the sake of anticipation and clearness, then return to this point of self regard, wherein you address yourself as one who is merely present and growing right now. In that, will the proper vector be one of general excitement by virtue of goodness being present from any end that comes, as well as a rooted indifference to any outcome which might otherwise appear uncomfortable. "In that last sense, you are only giving plausible occurrences more figure and charm by thinking of them; and what is right, is to instead focus on the fact that there is very little that you can do to dictate the result." However, if you engage in the contrary of this fretting, and merely assess what you really care about and the ease by which it can be achieved, then the wideness of the lens will grant you both a calming relief and breezy advance, as well as encouragement by the positive outcomes and or likelihoods that this rested state of yours sees.
    <br>&emsp;In that, if we relax and let ourselves go, tending to our heart and lawful loins instead, then what is actually more likely to happen will become more apparent -and seemingly favorable. For me, this reflects the ground level fact that our funds and profit are set to last for the near year to come; moreso, the events that have expressed themselves as likely to follow, offer me much unapprehension at our return to the coast, future support from our parents, sooner or later privilege through the following year or two to come, as well as our actual inheritance (of sorts) upon our father's death. And I don't mean to be morbid, I merely am aware with how I would rightly use it -which drags me little on approach, for there is very little that I need right now. "Henceforth why I am unafraid to look forward to it, for I am not restless without out". Bringing this all together then, that self regard we have truly benefits us when we refer to it as our regular advancement and indifferent ease onto the steps that come. Not only does lightness and creative engagement accrue, but so does the future and all that it could bring. "For in being unafraid of what will come or what you are supposed to do, does a profitable choice or welcomed end become acceptable to merely sit there, as my choice in the matter bears no haste or care. So I will just let the probability of it happen -while I gently and flourishingly proceed."
 </div>
 <div id="mark">
    I can either reflect on the past and address hows its moments are impacting me right now, or I can consider the future and what it is I wish to accomplish. For one thing, it is not like there is anywhere for us to go. And even if some project or stage in our life would allow us to be more adventurous and engaged, so will this not happen with any ease or necessity; that is, a great deal of time will be required to even simply be yourself -by which the extension of that will give you what you genuinely seek. Of those outer things which flaunt our eye, will they demand even more; moreover, less we are without much thought on the matter, would we otherwise come to see that such ends would in fact be more of the same. "For as Socrates says, wherever you go, by your legs let's say, so will the body follow." The point being, that if you were fine here, then the reasons for so would see your ends comparable no matter the position. "It's as if all we needed was water, yet we saw great pleasure in those things which conferred confidence to there being more later on, yet right now there is ample amounts, lastingly to; moreso, when we look at the future, it is admittedly bright in what its course will offer, as well as being sufficiently met by things which we will be necessarily able to address: so why elsewhere ponder?"
    <div class="qu">In that, we will always have enough, as will the line of what we are ingrained to have and the means by which even more will come -persisting and improving</div>
    Im noticing though that there is less to compel me to wake up in the morning. There is to be clear alot of poor choices from even duller thinking that have me lagging behind, though, two things seem otherwise promising. One, is that you can solidify the scope of your nourishing efforts as to be more dense and substantive. Instead of doing a moring flow, followed by a hatha stability, with later rest and recovery for evening and before bed, simply do a great session that boldens them all. Rather than a slew of sequences, do this giant bout of standing, upper body, torso and recovery. This is effective in that your goal for the day is clear and compounded, as well as branching you off to do more voluntary sequences; these may naturally come after, or embellish themselves as the moments of focus for the day. "Moreover, would the simplicity that followed be reason enough." As I see it, sessions are wide yet shallow -moreso are their elements general- whereas a sequence is narrow and focused. In that way, this latter is more select and repetitive in its effort, while the session is more welcoming to other exercises that fit into the standing, holds, torso or recovery molds. "For in these moments, the goal is to complete the whole; and so side raises, handstands or pigeon pose can be done as promptly as the rest. Whereas the chaturanga sequence is best done from down to drop to up and back several times, with only light variety in between." In other words, broader efforts make way for niche elements, while focused ones fair better when the concentration is select to ones we regularly do.
    <div class="qu">In a similar way would more oranges fit our bill during the days, where some is good, so more is plenty!</div>
    Now, the front end of these remarks is in having more to do. We are not vying for some great project though, with the aim of it bringing us somewhere, rather we are presently trying to do what it is we can do the most. So we wrote a book, rebuilt our website, set up our studies, music and channels. Pictures are good to follow, as well as additions to those prior. Writing too is its own ripe reward, with our strength and ease elsewhere giving amendable time to produce within these investments. I think what is happening, is that we are not in short of things we want to do, rather we are too shuffled on what the requirements are and our view of there worth. "It seems less important to wake up early or to be so orderly when our aim is merely personal and passive." It seems then that a grand project or some mighty sort of business would justify more elaborate means -as to reach these greater ends. Writing though, requires little, as do games, movies, formatting and reflection. Industry does require immediate cares, which in practice spreads out the provident efforts into select pieces, but generally if our ends are purely onto our drifting rewards, then so the means can be more relaxed. In that sense, would a big bout of hatha as well as a big bout of strength, earn us the requisite blocks for our living to flourish widely ontop. "Whereas strict efforts equally high above need equally narrow foundations below." That's not to say that errors won't be made and that rules won't be better in place. However, my experience is that it is those narrow confines of good and provision that result in us stepping outside of the line. And these errors are never so bad, but they are hard to amend to, and as a result leave us with nothing: for the top is hard to return to. If our times are one of prominence though, and widely so in the means and their ends, then mere principals apply; that is so for the sides cant be fallen out of, rather we can fall too far below -where sugar lies. Eating breads, potatoes, figs, smoothies, quinoa, barely, corn and rice, as well as oranges(in plenty), kale and mushrooms, almonds or pistachios, and anything that is in whole generally true, feeds that expanse that is our living. "For there is little room for specific error, as the room for our life is as big and wide as its action claims."

 <div id="construct">
    The core truths of our lives have to do with food, training, careers, family and death. Though these are each common in our lives and expected to happen in whichever fashion, ought we discern what a good end from each would mean, and how our directed time can affirm this as the norm. In a similar way, we spend our time and attention in pursuit of office, commerce, property and profession, so why don't we direct those means towards the aspects of our lives which truly impact us? Money gives us no real friendship, nor does office and wealth provide the means for genuine parentage and familial bonding; in fact these things more often than not find themselves at the mercy of such ambitions. Instead, we can recognize that each scenario that we are in really offers us the same; if it is tough, it is usually our sensibility and fortitude that evens out any of the challenge, and firms us against whichever difficulty remains. If it is favorable and interesting, then our generous response and accompanying gratitude brings out the scene as to be more significant and reliable. "For we see it more." This feels appropriately contrary to that ignorant notion that one's position in life will act like an ointment to stress and hardship, or if something good occurs, that it is the promise of more and the luxury provided that is seen as good. "This is besides the stronger point that in either case, it is we who determine the affective result: as we are the vessel by which these scenarios come through. And there is a genuine lack of wisdom to see the latter as the priority, rather than our selves."
    <br>&emsp;The point though, is that even though we wish to be happy and void of distress, our application of these values must first be set onto things which are most prevalent. A good example is in doing business well but sleeping poorly. That former will eventually be outweighed by the lows of the latter as well as being brought down in what it personally brings. Now, if we focused on our sleep, then that care or mindset might see the business as less important or simply ineffective regarding the scales in place. But this is our core tenant, that of living and its goodness that we forwardly seek, no matter the cost or prior interest of things themselves. "We ought to become wise and sensible, then assess what things are with respect to that; here, will we learn the core truths of ourselves in that we have addressed the things most relevant and near to us, and with a mind of determining how they ought to be seen and arranged so that a good experience is claimed."
    <br>&emsp;Everything must center around this point. otherwise, we are headed for a place where goodness is absent, or bad at least is too prevalent( as in those thieving billionaires). Furthermore, are we better to be sensible and measured as opposed to vehemently principled, as these kinds of routes suggest that you are ingrained to an extreme response to the badness that was prior; moreso, do you forgo the broad applications in both your generosity and core regard, as regimented and strict systems typically resist any sort of change, so improvements and or corrections(of errors) fail to be made. Thoughtfulness, admiration and respectful assurance bring us a better way. This is because the particular aspects of our lives are given the room and space to cultivate under the guise of our sensibility. At the base we are then given a nourishing and dutiful strength, and in response an upfront means for industry, friendship and care.
    <br>&emsp;This life is a rounded one; moreso, does it fit well with its own address of family, civil liberties and death. As a science we know not that it is true, only that it is strong. Our framework that explains this is merely one with meat on the bone, and this is only in an increasing state, a tended one, rather than being complete. There are many reasons for this, as are there for it being enough. Foremost is this because we recognize that there is a game, and that seeing so suggests that the point of our reasoning is to better demonstrate ourselves in it and earn the sought for rewards. Learning about the game and nature of play itself, merely serves us to be more strategic and tactical, only for the better though as opposed to something vain -or idly technical. This is because the state that we reach wherein we would say that our end was true, is merely one of prominence; for those ends are ones where we are living, moving, reassessing and confirming, reflecting and improving and all sorts in between. "We may know more and thus be able to further grow and produce, but our need to digest does not go away; our merit in reasoning then is merely to provide more fruits, for our nature which remains."
    <br>&emsp;Truths then are associated with things themselves and in many ways are defined with respect to them. Simply, these insights mark the experience that we see as favorable and desired, and which things show themselves as fitting or not for that. "We know that sleeping is important; that is a value. That chocolate before bed negates this is a very basic truth but one no less. Whether or not veggies would be better is comparably known and assessed, but we may either experience this first hand, or merely suspect based on what our prior reasoning suggested about the time before sleep." In that sense, as we evaluate things, we learn more about the values we need. In that prior case, we could say that food before bed is quite poor, as its place is better for breakfast and during the day. What this may mean otherwise, is that when we had sugar in the morning we felt terrible, as did bread feel poor in the afternoon and rice before sleeping. Specifically, we know something about these, but generally do we know that the time that we eat is important; in that way, we may find things to perform otherwise, or are merely suitable compared to those more vicious things -sugar fairs worse at all times compared to broccoli, yet initial and closing moments care less for each. Put another way, we can say that things are superior or not to one another in a certain respect, but that the principle may in fact thrive from absence. "A small murder is better than a huge one, but both are still lacking good." And it's not to say that this model for thinking and assessment is complete and perfect, but it is a serviceable one. We'll take the heart of it then and apply it to things, which in the end is all that we seek, rather than the means to know: as the former is our aim.
 </div>
 <div id="deliberate">
    A friend is that person who cares about something that you do; the effect then is that you share something, which amounts to more openness and care to be involved. Being drawn though is not without its risks, as the same as it is on your own with bad things, so do those interests that are bad with friends deserve equal contempt. "The good though may only find you alone in place; yet when a friend comes by, or with your state as a friend to yourself, will the right ends and their steps be better set, for both regularity and reward." Parents too have their ways, as their place is one of giving but also stubbornness. Our course though comes to fruition here, as when they pass away will time and privilege be enhanced, or furthered at least. "So be respectful and trustful that their care for you is genuine, and that being happy is all your free to be: so be."
    <br>&emsp;The truths of training and food are the most expansive here, as there are so many specifics that result in various effects. I'll name a few for each. Circuit training fairs the most when it comes to strength as an accessible yet significant amount of cardio and resistance can be achieved. As a prior our hatha works well as does its resting emphasis in the later day that follows; moreso, as it is in the morning, does a flow sequence following our workout smooth us out and allow for initial and subsequent stretching. Regarding that hatha, the central count fairs the best. In this case, breathing for at least one whole time during the pose allows for each one to be administered well and transferred optimally towards the next. Breathing in and out is how you want to come in and out of each position, yet a full breath in between is where the openings rise. Moreover, that less you wish to do many minor sequences, that major sessions can be simply done. Here, you combine standing, holds, core work and rest into one large address. One of the benefits is that its width allows for efficiency to be had with less focus and intensity, whereas a smaller session gains its benefits from a higher standard. This lower threshold for concentration paired with the larger size of the progression, gives room for accessory exercises that you might not do otherwise: side planks can be done during holds, or handstands during core. In a sequence's case, the strictness of it holds little opportunity for new additions. Whether the early day holds this kind of session, or you merely do a vinyasa, a brief portion of flow to begin the day and rest to end it makes our training enough. Those are the truths of physical health.
    <br>&emsp;Food wise, the truths are more crucial yet acceptable to loosely define. Fundamentally you don't want to eat early or very late, and that starches and carbs are best for the latter part of the day. Secondly, is that lighter foods ought not be had following heavy ones; so rice should not follow potatoes nor should figs follow rice. Giving yourself more freedom to eat the same fruits and vegetables during the day can give you assurance and ease towards reaching the sustenance of the evening. Moreso, does edamame come into fruition as a welcomed protein source -if your training is more prevalent. Thirdly, and perhaps the most misunderstood, is that momentary nutrition fairs different than your baseline response. If you go for a sprint then your body ought to refuel from such exertion. If you hadn't trained for two weeks prior, then the baseline needs would be small. "So much time has gone by where we failed to make this distinction." And its point does not rest so much on what momentary choices you should make, rather that you should keep your baseline in mind. As it stands, when it is small(or lower rather) then grains are favorable compared to starches -as the latter surpasses your needs too quickly. When your training and corresponding needs increase, so does starches and proteins relevance -as well as the lowered ease by which dried fruit is had. Bread too loses its place as your body needs more; for just as potatoes fair little compared to barely and quinoa when your training little, so does bread get pushed out when potatoes come in -when your training is more, and less doughs required, but fuel. Keeping this in mind and having your sense of right and wrong tuned by this direction will see that your principal strength becomes both effective and simple. "For you can say which grains and starches to have, and when, as well as whether produce and dried fruit is appropriate or necessary -for we may bet better off in having more sustenance rather than ruffage."
    <br>&emsp;In terms of interest then, I have little. This is due to the cold admittedly, but our response is also creatively fatal. As I see it, what is good is that which allows you to continually do what is positive. In other words, an action will produce subsequence use if it is fitting; so if we read and enjoy it, we'll read more or if we are playing a game, so will our experience with it stack our investment. Whereas, it seems to be hard getting into things when we are at a standstill. This is no consequence of how drawn we are, or how worthwhile things tend to be, rather we break our movements by sleeping in, training irregularly and eating poorly. Typically, we rebound back to a freshened state but our actions are diminished; interest thus wanes and our care for things has to be redrawn. "This is a core reason for not acting poorly, as it prevents the presence and or advancement through alternatively favorable routes."
    <br>&emsp;Principally, our wish is to live well, and this aim rises above the applicable things; if we fail at some course of action, and miss them, it is really our resolve to live well in the first place that remains, not our effective place within the action. In that sense, our hopes and wishes to do more with the efforts that we have, are really remarks that come from points in which we are no longer engaged. "When we are participating in something, I care not where we'll go. Yet, when my position wanes, and I feel empty upon the initial point of return, I conjure images of how I can greater proceed. This merely reflects our fear of being outside the state, and its then hasty resolve to return." This sense then that we will fall from grace is not to be amended by making the heights higher; rather, you must become more ordained to the value of living, and deliberate with that as your scale. "That all goods and reason are set within the measures in how they pertain to that desired experience." To me, the specifics only come naturally, in that you think about how you are going to do more, rather than how you will begin. "For the former amounts to current additions, whilst the latter sees larger foundations for a higher aim. The more you get there though the lesser the heights and structure are needed; and consequently, does your planning elsewhere take you away from the point in which living would be in place, and thus you fall again." Simply assent to that more approachable point as the position that you want to be and let it flower and bloom, rather than trying to get far ahead by getting part way to some further end. "For that clearly reflects the view from someone fleeing from their idling doom."
 </div>
 <div id="innerweaving">
    Since our aim is to live, and this amounts to enjoyment, then the means to this(or nourishment rather) holds the bulk of truths. That is, what is fairly correct is that which truly brings out our objective. For example, in Buddhism, the goal is Moksha, as a state, a Samadi, the central mean by virtue of ending rebirth and karma. “The truths then are routed towards the removal of contrasts to our aim, and the saturation of what is good for them.” In the Buddhist case, Dukkha and Samadya are removed by Niroda, and its cultivated path of Magga. Upon finishing this, one quenches all their negative hunger; Nirvana is this cleanse, while Moksha is the prevailing state. In our case then, we could say that accurate assessment of what affects us dearly, embeds itself as the means towards flourishing, prosperity and tranquility. That is our Moksha, and the confidence we have and respect that follows are the positive signs of progress: our Nirvana. The baser truths though say that one must only confess their aim of living; the struggle is that admitting that you are in fact not, leaves you feeling suspended and at the mercy of all to come. “For you are not trying to get to some place, but rather become someone. And in that case, it is only more clear that you are currently not.” I would say though that the positive encasing that this admission brings, is genuine sensibility; for in our world, environments and scenarios present themselves to us, that would otherwise leave us principally free to engage with the world openly. These tasks though are natural and fair, only we must respond to them both effectively and maturely -and thus be honest and wise.
    <br>&emsp;The Second rule on top of the core interest of living, is that upon taking more time and care will our tasks be handled more effectively, done so as they are needed as opposed to fretting over or striving towards some further place; consequently, your are left with some actual good, in that you are lightened from your gratitude and strength, as well as plumped up from the active experience that follows. Regularity of this brings more confidence that it can be achieved, assurance that it is the right thing to do, satisfaction with what you have reached or are currently in, as well as anticipating what else will come -and therein what else you are willing to do as a means for it. The result that blossoms on top of this is our Moksha, a realm of imperial bliss and charming joy. “Nothing but the edge of this could see such righteous grandeur and beauty; for if you are out of this then you are merely elsewhere aligned.” For it is natural for one to be hopeful, composed, satisfied and unapprehensive when their situation is in harmony with them; that is, the demands are in check and the benefits are known. “More on each end is welcomed and looked forward to.”
    <br>&emsp;This is all baked with sensibility. That is, we are imbuing ourselves with a structure that innately responds to its aim of achieving Moksha, or joy rather. Because our place is with things, and of the actionable kind, then our experience will be determined by how we participate in the field that holds these moments of engagement. Specifics are hard though for we commonly find ourselves on that side of things as we are making judgments about them. Instead, we are better to sit with ourselves, being both valued and sensible in how we are best to proceed. In that way, we are more calibrated and confident from being so, whereupon the success that marks the proper achievement of where our mind and aims are set, reinforces the objective and our means of acquiring it. I think this contrasts Buddhism in the fact that we are more aware that there are things. And perhaps I am so focused on my highlights, but reading, personal study, training, eating well, great films and leisure, the scenes of the world, are not draining experiences; rather, they fill you up like a pump who grows upon being squeezed. In that, we gain everything when we do activities of this sort for they act moreso as vessels for us to contribute. “Whereas the Buddhist concern is in rearranging ourselves away from things in which we hope to be given something by.” We on the other hand are looking for and happy with things that we can throw ourselves into.
    <br>&emsp;Our eschatology then comes from the sensibility that this positive aim comes with; in that case, we merely see that we are going to die, the end of which will be a tranquil rest. Not only do we see this as fair, for we could not otherwise live, but in being so we actually welcome it and thus despair not, and enjoy the leading time as it is. “As we are in life, a dreamless sleep is graced upon us. Onto the end of all our living, will such rest be equally seen.” Now, our epistemology is rooted in the innate nature that we have heralded for millennia. That is, we came from monkeys to man, yet the latter is subject to Gods rather than himself. This is because we are aware of all but acting on it little. “As if the results from reason don’t make the lense.” Because of that, we are effectively monkeys with the abilities and familiarity of man. Yet we have not made mature uses of them. What we know then is that we are merely trying to live. And to fill in my own gaps, would I say that a chimp actually fairs comparable to us in terms of how its experience is dealt. Sex to it is pleasurable, and by its place in the jungle is idleness never close. Moreso is it likely warm by virtue of its compatibility with the canopy and warm environment. Just as we are well of in certain areas, or making up for it with technology, so is the monkey in its own congenial habitat. There are dangers though, and surviving is miles deeper than our own simple walk to the store.  
    <br>&emsp;The point, is that our needs being met are no different than that of some other. We happen to find it easier to achieve baser things than anything else though, but here an important point arrives. What does one do when their roots are in actual doing, yet there is no need for them to survive? They become idle, restless, stuck with responsive tradition, or otherwise gluttonous and avaricious. In a way then, we are trying to live when the ask to do so is not placed on us, rather we make it ourselves. For me, the heart of this is just as we gain little for moments of sex, so does the monkey. And admittedly its everyday life bears some pleasure, or satisfaction at least seeing as it is well off and engaged with its environment, yet I don’t believe that it is flourishing, or imbued with joy and rest. I am sure a monkey is in most ways senseless or on alert, or with pleasure otherwise. However, the latter comes just as it goes, the second arises almost to its despair, and the former marks that its life is not so full of living: for its lack of industry, intellect, admiration and care, render it contrary to generous and full living, and instead it is more passive. To be clear though, I think the monkeys passing time is more satisfying than ours because it is still generally active in the jungle. I just don’t think it extends beyond this in any significant way.  
    <br>&emsp;We on the other hand, have little interest or time to meddle, for the environment is already taken care of; moreso is the nature of the land around us one that becomes rather sequestered and hollow. This is why we bend towards those pleasures, or in some cases run towards danger and risk, or otherwise seek adventure. The problem is that these are aims for the world to happen to us. “Let there be fun, challenge or some new place abroad. These don’t fill us up though, as once they are done we simply want more.” The key issue is not that these activities are poor in how you feel; rather, their profit is not one where similarly good feelings follow. The novelty wears off, desires continue, and exclusion of other goods generally fall into place. I know this is true by the simplest of recognition. I need to convince you not that rest and contentment are superior to restlessness and contentment. Only, we must be careful and considerate as to how things bring these qualities of us out. We know that things are going to happen, and that seeing as our past is banked upon this that we are in most ways congenial to things happening at all. Better said, if nothing happens we will become idle; and as a poor feeling itself we will be driven to find life elsewhere. “And this response usually has its own perils and shortcomings.”  
    <br>&emsp;What I can measure and assess is the deepness of my breath; I cannot say what breath necessarily is and thus mark out all the spots in which it could be, matching then where my current state aligns; rather I can fairly recognize good from strong breathing, just as I can for good and bad sleep. Simply, there is a subjective element that need not be further confessed, only admitted to as the measure. That is, if I am at peace and rest, then the physiology and fundamental philosophy that accompanies this is not crucial to test. Stress though, and injury in clear cases, has more objective measures -in hormones and visibility. The point though, is that what we are looking for is that experience we deem well. Ontologically we are opposed to intervention; moreso, is our providence one that is ubiquitous in the elements, and natural in the form. Conclusively, we will fret and fry or live and die, that latter being so for the former has their eyes closed. I only subject it based on our viewing experience. “I’ll be there for death”.  
    <br>&emsp;I only then mean to remove the presumption that this course of ours is resoundingly true, and is otherwise a universal scale. I fair not in this case. Rather, I see myself and am content with the days that I have only known, becoming more in line with that experience of satisfaction and rest, as opposed to distress and boredom. To me, these are our foundational measures. For even if we do not otherwise know, we can say that there is nothing else to suggest -seeing as intervention, fairness of death, ostentation and a deep breath appear sound in our regards. The game is hard to explain, for it is in many ways made up, or ignored as the traditional response which it truly reflects. The strategy and tactics though are not clearly the aim to better; rather the ends of our play and what we experience is what we are better to address. “For the equipment we use, attitude that we bring, training we employ and efforts we produce, will bring us towards a more suitable and amendable state of victorious regularity. And one suitable to us too.”

    As it stands, there are four primary truths. In total, they amount to what’s good, as do their negations reflect the bad; moreso, does the absence of the former suggest the latter, as does the absence of the latter provide the former. “Would a lack of wounds not describe good health? Or would a lack of health, or wholeness to our stature, not comparably suggest an illness or injury? I think so.” In any case, the four truths are as follows. One, is we ought to be void of doubts and scrutiny over our actions. “I wish not to eat or train, for example, in a way that makes me anxious about the results which follow.” Here the second truth arrives, in that we should be confident in what we do. “What will come I do not know, but practically speaking I am reassured by the good in what we are doing; at the very least these actions are what I can stand by.” This truth readily thrives on reflection and resolve, as we give insight into what has worked and what in absence equally does so. In that way, if we are good then we can be happy that our path will continue; or if we are poor, then we can at least feel bolstered by the better aim that were trying for. These more or less make the back end of truths.
    <br>&emsp;On the front, the third truth is that we ought to anticipate what we are doing. Looking at what those nourishing truths offer, we can see how their provision is best when our ends are ones that excite us to arrive at. “We ought to write and feel drawn to do more. It’s not the case that things should be banked upon, nor should outcomes and fortune linger in our mind, but onto what we have done so far that we find respectable and confirming, so too will more of it be welcome.” Lastly, and where this blossoms, is that our activity is one we enjoy. Simply, the measure of our lives is that the components are pleasing to us; consequently, will we anticipate more of them and feel confident if our means toward them are sound; nor will we feel absent if the errors against this are avoided. Buddhism in comparison, has ignorance, suffering and rebirth, each of which unite to form the whole. Each element though is a portion of truth, or a piece rather onto that unison. In our case here, it is the stitching of aversion, amendment, disposition and reward that come together to form the good. Corresponding to that, are the elements that come to be in the absence of these parts. To be clear though, that these are not things in and of themselves, rather subjects within our discourse that describe the voids left by the absence of those better (and truer)pieces. In that, will a lack of sensibility to what would be bad, leave you with cluelessness and frivolity. “As if you don’t even know that you are suffering.” On top of that, will a lack of principle and self respect leave you with a mixture of doubts and uncertainty. “As if your reasoning for acting how you do, is not one that you’d stand by, as what it suggests is not commendable.” Furthermore, will your disposition drag you away from anticipation. For one, your ignorance will not prevail by virtue of its ineffective nature; two however, is that awareness that you are poorly kept and defined will only reveal that the end is not one to look forward to. “The steps that you now see, are towards an end which is not desirable.” Foremost though, is the presence of frailty and discontent. This is the hardest thing to reproach from, since if you are moving away, then your view from the bottom only reveals how far away the top is. “That is why people stay ignorant: for if they only knew how lackluster their experience was, oh how troubling that would be.”
    <br>&emsp;All that being said, it is important to note that these truths are not qualifications for things. Rather, they are embodiments of how we are intrinsically. That isn’t to say that things don’t affect us, but that happiness is a point to reach, or thing to have, as is restlessness a thing to avoid or place to refrain, is not true. Instead, these are arrangements of ourselves. And I should be clear that the configuration is found through things, as our expectation of some event may be gently ingrained to us and leave us thus with contentment, or we may cling to it and becomes apprehensive. The point is, just as deep and shallow breaths are descriptions of ourselves rather than the ways of air and oxygen, so too will gluttony and savasana serve as inputs to our vessel, of which happiness and its negation are states of the mold. That is the crucial thing to know, for despite the resting end, so too does our living state benefit from a generous scale for judgment. That, is then onto the subject of application; whereupon learning the truth, we address how we’ll live. “And the results of that which are most positive are those by which the proper scale is credited.” Place yourself before ignorance then, and remove all assumptions of what you need and simply ask what you require: is it not that state of your vessel being void of rugged proclivities, and full of righteous ones instead? I feel like our need for more is strictly because we have not clarified that what we seek is that: for which the scales of good are made.”

 <div id="aman">
    To expect and regret something is to refer to some measure of truth. Good or bad refers to our assessment right now, of some factor or thing. However, these estimates are really based on what we are naturally inclined or averse towards. For example, we bring our hands away from the fire as our innate tendency is to avoid it; however, if the perils of hell upon death must be particularly amended to in order to avoid, then so would our nature’s wish to fall in line. To be clear, we are not comparing impulse and higher thought. Rather, we can know for example that eating heavily before bed is unfavorable in a nourishing and thus rewarding sense. Basic thought and awareness reveal this as true. It is merely a personal truth though, whereas objective truths reflect the frameworks above us; this amounts to ends and consequences which we could not effectively anticipate. “Unless we use reasoning.”
    <br>&emsp;People have responded in this sense and forged pernicious systems of divine promise and benevolence; simply though, their conclusions are wrong. Foremost, is that their truths are merely composed of air weaving; that is, compared to stitching linens whose fibers come together strong under the needle, our religious sentiments are like arranging abstract ideas and possibilities. Better said is the heart of it purely deductive, as if there are musts, rather than the points being sound and likely. The attempt though is not foolhardy, as a simple line of regress does bring you to ponder an origin, and therein where it is to. The practical mistake is our fallibility in configuring the parts that we get from such inquiry. “You do not know the true origin of the universe, nor can you even regard its complexity and principal nature. Moreso can you not account for it on the whole scale, and thus your place within it.” Better said, our view of objective truths are in error due to their certain completion. “As a man who is reasonable and mature, these weavings of ideas and concepts into floating frameworks bear little truth nor use for me. I am only seeking to be happy as nature has ordained. In that, ought my reasoning for things rest neat and tidy beside me, rather than trying to paint the world. The outside scenery will do instead.” That is what I need to explain.
    <br>&emsp;This concludes it for me. As a man, I am unsure. What a man is though, is one who seeks rest and freedom, and avoids idol discontent. These are not values any more than gun shots are an aversion -or as air is preferable. “The elements of me are what define me; and as my bones fair poorly when broken, so does my mind when it is drenched with sugar and crumby thinking. And so forth.” The interesting thing then, is that if these peculiarities innate to me amount to the quality of living, then our formative response(as opposed to earlier impulsive ones) is to ardently consider, resolve and compose ourselves in a relevant way so that our environment is in harmony with us. We seek food because we need it, just as there is heartfelt security from a friend. So to do we avoid dark alleys for the fear of a mugging, and otherwise act respectful in public. The crux of our mindset is in the following addition. It is easy to demonstrate our nature through examples that show our core aversions. That is, where we run away from and avoid clearly illustrates something about us. What is more difficult to explain is why we would choose to study in school, as if remaining safe from predators garnished similar attention and care as being employed. This is the point to explain.
    <br>&emsp;As I see it, where we must come in line is in understanding that what makes a high career good or a sensible action or reservation prudent, is not something we must choose to desire or like. Rather, the results of these are goods that we innately find favorable. The issue though, is that rest and contentment come from forward actions, whereas the aversion and fear of tigers and snakes are responsive. The crucial strand of our reasoning though, is that the values for each equally mark the man, and thus his nature. “Fresh health and a clear mind are definitively equal as preservation of air and an interest of sex, in regards to our core tendency.” A useful parallel to this is that mention of virtue and vice, in that on neither side do all actions amount to the same in severity, yet within each are things strictly one or the other; they say then that although cheating on your wife is quite poor, and that however worse murdering is when it comes to being bad, that badness should be seen as consistently poor regardless of a particulars strength. That is it more or less. In that sense, we can see how preference, skill, prominence and interest vary when it comes to our core proclivities; but we should equate them equally ‘as perclivites’ regardless of how their individual ‘peculiaritieness’ is. “A domain explains this nicely, that joy and self respect fit within the same range as frivolity and trauma. Where they differ is in their color and saturation; as elements though, or items rather, they all fit the line of what defines us. And as that marks our nature, so too would our deliberate regard or measured response relate to the subject or maker that we are.”
    <br>&emsp;This could not be more important to know, for it removes the need for an objective measure; as our nature clearly is defined besides the need for it. To our benefit then, we can paint. “But as painters though, happily, rather than those who must know if they can, and in effect doubt whether their sense that they can is correct, or otherwise that their work must be submitted and in(that) effect, alter the creations we mean to make and thus what we feel compelled to or at liberty to see.” My own nature reveals to me that these are clouds of exhaust coming from our pipes of reason; the road is ahead though and, in driving, there’s fairness, pleasure and care from all that I see. And are those fumes not a result for the sake of those? Moreso, should my objective then be to grab all the smoke, ‘or put my foot on the pedal’? Perhaps the purpose of those former is to prevent the drunk driving that we see. “If there were no laws against this though, wouldn’t reason still carry you to drive sober, so that you could see.”

 <div id="embers">
    I’d like to dedicate these thoughts to Plutarch, whose illustrative aims and power reflect my own, to which I am grateful and with comfort. As he has said, disposition molds life; that is, it is the foot that bends with the shoe. As I see it, we are bowls, spheres, vessels if you will. If left unattended, then the walls will close in, increasing the pressure by which troubles and concerns exist. Consequently, are they more likely to ignite: the result being hot headedness. “And, as they say, such hot heads are not actually big ones. Rather they are small, where problems easily bounce around.” On the flip side, if our borders are more expanded, then incoming affairs can float around more easily and freely. In effect, they will either not become inflamed and thus act as deeds rather than burdens, or if they do spark up the flame will be at most mild. “That is why, in contrast, we can say that those who are well-tempered are so because they have the space to fit everything.” Now, there is a point of wisdom for each side. On the part of intolerance, we can say that removing issues in the first place will remove the required embers for heat; note however that problems will always arise, so long as the world and you remain. It’s not that we can’t become more sensible and become less intruded, or be longing for things whose absence equally stirs us up, ‘but never will the bowl be empty’. To me, it feels like a strict condition that the vessel be attended to, otherwise, the expected instances of intrusion will necessarily burn. There is another related point as to the relief caused by a larger bowl, but we’ll come to back to that shortly.
    <br>&emsp;With our small enclosure in mind -with all the animals in the pen bumping around- we can see clearly that the walls should be extended. This is quite simple mind you, though those prone to or in a state of heatedness tend not to see the greens around. Nevertheless, as in most discourse, we are discussing things as if they were something we would in fact address, or otherwise do. And I can say a great deal about what will specifically widen your foundations, but I will subsist by merely being formulaic about it. That is, what is good(we’ll say) is that which gives you a bigger bowl -or a suitable one at least. This, as we said, is to remove the proclivity for ignition, as well as allowing for concerns to rest easily within you. The good then will allow you to sit with troubles with more ease, and solve them in a more able minded fashion. In contrast to that, will the bad be that which results in a smaller bowl; gluttony tends to do this actively, while ignorance or shortness when it comes to fruitful activities serves you the same(by virtue of their absence).
    <br>&emsp;What these activities of good and bad are, I will not for the moment say. It is not that I have little sense or suspicion, only that the discourse here relies on either an objective measure, or approach at least towards it -that being an account for what is right and wrong. For now, I am simply suggesting what outcomes we would want, as to establish our value, and letting the student and or person assess what activities and resolutions seem to fit that. In other words, you may say what things are good or bad based on the experience you have. What I am saying in a more forward sense is what results we will say are poor and which are favorable. “And, definitively, goods bring out the latter while the bad draws the former.” I will assume these values, and by virtue of our bowl illustration assume that the heart of it is worth agreeing upon: to which things you do specifically, that can be up to you.
    <div class="qu">Take this scale, I recommend it be yours. What we should measure though, that is less clear. Through our inquiry though we can better know -as our reflections and care demonstrate- but only to a likely objective end. Because of that, I only invite you into these talks regarding things and definitive measures if you are fine to be suspended and suggestive when it comes to what things we actually do. However, besides right and wrong, we can still use a scale of good and bad. For none can tell us that irksomeness and hot tempers are worthwhile, while rest, satisfaction and joy deserve avoidance.”</div>
    Another important point is in regards to the goods that come from the bowl. As we said, if the walls are close together, then the elements of our lives will feel compressed, and thus ignite. Moreover, does the likely accompanying stiffness of these fumes exasperate the problem. If the bowl is large though, two things happen. One, as we said, is that troubles and concerns have more room to mozy around, and thus become less prone to ignition, and with less severity when they in fact do. Secondly though, and to the good, is that this increased area allows for positive elements to cultivate. Interests, inquiries, personal care, the removal needing prospects, the introduction of ostensibility etc., these ideas and cares will have the room and freedom to assemble themselves into light yet hearty things. “For they have less scruff and gruff dragging them down; or in other words, there are less sparks of avarice and spite putting out the embers of good and green.”
    <br>&emsp;Two things regarding this. One, is that the removal of inflammation makes the birthing grounds for these things more welcoming and fruitful, which gives us the benefit of being void of negation and full of promise. Secondly, is that the growth of those goods carry the enclosure as to keep it ripe and plenty. A useful example would be how air underneath a tarp lifts it. Now, in the case of these goods, their evenness increasingly spreads across these greater grounds, and upon becoming more solid and ingrained, firm the walls themselves as to keep them from pillowing in, as well as giving them that fluffing effect, wherein their own milder heats and pleasure give the enclosure a blossoming effect. “As a cloud remains solid and whole, yet through its lightness pillows over.”  
    <br>&emsp;Altogether, this is a mere illustration. It is a useful one though, as we can see that it is really we who determine the results. That simply being the case because we are the ones who take things in; as there are elements that offer, and thus our ‘bowl’ so to speak, will tilt our ends as being compressed and inflamed, or evenly fresh and stable. “Thus, a hard brittleness is no measure of strength: we seek a more robust and virile firmness and solidity.”

 <div id="ends">
    How we feel right now is worth reflecting along with the course of our lives. The former may in fact just need some tender love and care, while the latter could simply bring its light into further fruition. As for the present, I am fairing well with our interests and duty; though, the nature of this can bring me into a point of immediacy, 'as good becomes subpar to greatness'. It's important to remember though that feeling average is best compensated for by taking careful accounts of why you fell short in the first place - and then what you are going to do. And to that latter, I could say that keeping yourself active and accordingly fed in between strength sessions is a means of regulation, while returning to an aerobic state is otherwise crucial before resistance can be attempted -if and when you faltered. This will hopefully keep me in line. My attention though is fairly placed on what lies further ahead. As we refurbish ourselves from that lower state and make a resolve to become more effective, the larger path ahead becomes intriguing. Down that road we can see our parents leaving from early April to mid June, followed by another month long trip from the end of August to the middle of September. Then, though are edge here is marked, is a substantially longer trip in the early spring of next year. This seems all good and done. "And I am happy to rest with it as our course, rather than plan what will happen during or after: as what follows will more or less be the same. Thus my minds eye can fear not, and settle, to me."
    <br>&emsp;As for our life, our time and days are one thing, but our happiness is the other. For the former, we are graced with a trough of games, shows, films, creators, books, study, principal and noble resolve. This is pleasing, and respectful. Regarding our general lives though, my core is slipping. Admittedly, this can be explained by our solitary state unfolding as we become more apt and pure personally, and considering this it is clear that any slips in that stead are likely to reveal the wares of such solitude; but the potential of which the line at heart has yet to fully reach, that describes the answer. That is, we can see that there is a great deal to do; moreso, can the baseline of what we are required to meet as well as what we are given, is ample and increasing. Where the struggle comes in is that I have no plan for my life. The course is good, as is our every moment in place: it is merely the road that lacks a wheel, and by those moments where the joy is lowered, does my lack of grip become apparent. "For that is how I wish to live, as it seems the best in an admirable sense, of taking increasingly great steps, and letting that bring me to advancement." The core issue though is that our anticipations are waining due to a lack of real expectations. For our ends born from self importance and fantasy have been shed off, yet nothing has really replaced them. In that sense I can see where I am. And even though all the poorness has been removed as well as the aims which it purported, only the good in contrast has become fully placed: the according aims though need some development.
    <br>&emsp;On the whole of it I see so much interest and green in our righteous study. That is, like a painter who skillfully knows the world, are my own efforts similar. "Both in the care and keenness to the beauty I see, as well as the priviness to and ability with the craft that allows for an effective display." In that, has an all encompassing approach towards the mightiest of inquiries lit my way. "And what I mean is to give it the proper depth, as what I see must be respectfully drawn." The truth, is that what I see in those things which inspired me, as well as the end portrait itself, is where the reward lies. "The drawing and or painting otherwise, is merely peeling the fruit." A not unimportant note is that these paths are banked on regularity; and seeing as what I have to say is sought for based on interest as opposed to opportunity, then the abundance in which I mean to contribute marks a path which is not so casually begun. For I do wish people to see it as to draw out the value of the work; moreso, do I wish for others to be involved, so each element can be expanded upon its viable mold for tribute, as well as furthering the array of parts which we can be generous too in the first place.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, this path marks the route of me becoming the greatest version of myself. It is a massive line though, rather than a single figure which fairs well with occasional additions. For two reasons then should our resolve be contained. One, is that I am currently on my own and with more personal concerns. I love Middle Earth, but my place at home is to write about it rather than form a video -or wide production rather. This is partially explained by the fact that our civil scenario is one where the time is spent mostly walking or at home. As the sun rises so do we, not to some audience or crowd. And so, for one, these elements of abundant construction are secondary; which in itself fairly suggests that what is primary is a priority. Secondly though, is that my intent upon these is one that banks itself on regularity and growth. In that sense, I mean to go to war, rather than win a current battle. And with the current fight were in being one of personal interests and cares, then no lasting conquest is on the table. And that is the main point, that our present place in life is one where we are solidifying our core selves. "Therein, is our time more private and locally industrious, rather than being directed onto the world." Our base is all we have and in turn where we live. I don't have the troops nor the machinery to encompass the land, or achieve any significant victory for that matter. In other words, unless we actually win the war, then our return home will only see us wishing to return to battle. And for me, the more favorable choice is one where we continue forever, rather than retreating home.
    <br>&emsp;That isn't to say that these efforts will have to yield me with riches in splendor, no. "Their aim is reflected in what I actually mean to do, the living and tribute of which is the compensation." And to be clear then, that blogging, YouTubing, programming etc., are not poor choices in terms of what one wants to do, or what they could receive. What I wish to achieve though is a brilliant end, one of which amounts to an accomplishment: for I generously lived. Therefore, as that path is one where my consistency and care will be placed, then no other path which required the same will be acceptable. "For in those cases, not but that kind of commitment will yield a reward; and seeing as though for any path that the end is one with no finish in sight, then we ought to prioritize which one(under those conditions) we'd choose. And if the one which you see yourself sticking to is not one you can suitably begin right now, then simply keep it in mind." The course of which, will see our good sprout and extend. From us though will this happen, by which our current attention is merely onto the seed. "In which our life and nature will simply grow to our bettering end: for we are letting it happen."
 </div>

 <div id="virtue">
    Since we are alive, living seems to be the mold for our aim. That is, in a redundant way, that all ends are so if life is actually gained. A useful metric for this is joy. Rather, if we wish for our lives to be full of rest, satisfaction, contentment, excitement, curiosity, friendship and care, then we can say this is so for we enjoy these things. Opposed to that are those things which bring little joy, such as trauma, idleness, frailty and stress. Herein, will joy be our measure. Moreover, can we say something is good because we enjoy it; as well, can a lack of things which would otherwise be unenjoyable also be considered good. This is why they say then, that good and bad is found in ourselves rather than things. "As a long line causes trouble to one and nothing to another. The patience that composes that latter can be said to be good as it is favorable towards maintaining enjoyment." In that sense, we could say that what is good are those things which we enjoy; however, this must be colored with a touch of maturity, as a lack of character and understanding will not procure and desired results. To refine then, we can say that if joy is our sought for experience, then achieving this readily and smoothly carries more value. Therefore, will things that we enjoy momentarily but at the expense of others, be seen as minor goods, as their joy is also so. Seeing as we are placed within a condition that tells us to adhere to it through a certain way, then we can say that only those things which sufficiently abide and the otherwise select interests that fit with these harmoniously, mark any merit in being an eligible claim. I would point out in addition, that those goods aside from those within responsibility are soundly so if they work in unison with those demands; that is, that our more creative and leisurely interests sprout from the grounds in which we are ordained to, as well as being either supportive or encouraging for those lower tasks. In short, there are things we have to do and things we want to do, and in terms of why we have to do those former ought it be so we can provide for those latter; and these latter should be staked as if they were rooted from the offerings of the former, and, like a seed which gets carried to some adjacent place, 're-nourishes the ground and soil by which its origins were made'. As a complete picture then, we will say that goods are only so if they fit to this model; otherwise they will be seen as lesser, or of a lower kind -such as a full count of half goodness.
    <br>&emsp;Within this framework there are two sides: nourishment and reward. The former reflects the amendment to our condition so we may be present and thrive. The latter in contrast, marks the reason for committing to such demands, as we are given something that we seek. "Compensation more or less." Now, each can be regarded in one of two ways. In terms of our means, they can be central and of duty, wherein we abide by the law, act civil, shower, maintain our health etc. The other side is one where we develop skills, the ability for craft or mind for design and formation. In that, do higher interests at the front require their own particular means to enact them(such as skills as drafting); whereas those baser needs are merely in place for us to survive. On the flipside are what we get from what we do. And to be clear, that this end may in fact involve more doing, but of a preferable sort. "For example, if I am playing a game, my aim may in fact be to win, yet through my humble and better ways would the simple act of playing satisfy enough, rather than requiring the trophy upon completion." To be clear though as mentioned, there are two sorts of compensation. One, is a profit. In a specific sense this merely refers to the removal of friction for interest elsewhere; this may be for direct advancements towards some other end, or may simply remove the amount of core responsibility that you need to have, or otherwise soften the efforts required to lift the same load. Secondly are rewards. These are what we strive for the most, 'as we feel the best when the feelings are of this kind'. Profits are pleasing, but their heart and core is in what you can more easily do; it those highest things that reward us, and thus is where our furthest ends are placed. "For this end holds the things which we find rewarding, making the spot foremost." To connect a few dots, we can confidently say that these rewards usually come from efforts or activities where you are genuinely involved. "If your mind is elsewhere because something else feels more important, then that clearly describes this current place. If your doing something though that you have no interest or mind for somewhere else, then we can say it is rewarding for it is clearly pleasing in itself." In that case though, would this activity likely have its own kind of requirements; if it were some craft then the appropriate skills would be needed, or if it was some grand plan for producing an abundance of creation, then prior design and formation would also be necessary. These are at the back though, for even if they are baser efforts for works of a higher kind, they are still means. "In that we call them nourishing, simply higher than paying checks or doing remedial tasks."
    <br>&emsp;Adding to this, I will say that when it comes to the array of specific tasks and rewards, that the back is typcially more dense and concentrated, whereas the front end activities vary in what they offer and demand. "For writing books and fiction fairs differently in the genuine amount and quality than playing sports or driving cars. In that, despite residing within the same league of interest and rewards, the details for each reveals what they truly amount to. In that sense, these things are all definitively rewarding, but to what extent and by which credible means, is where they vary." Moreover then, do we use this sentiment to distinguish between average and higher goods. "As a brief sprint of a car is effectively lesser than an evening sunset with books or a friend." Even though the former has a higher high, so mine has a wider low. And when comparing the two, you can see how one is merely a knife whose point stretches a bit longer; while mine, being admittedly long and sharp though comparatively less, has a more wholesome and firmer base. And to me personally, that is the reward that my nourishment is banked on.
 </div>
 <div id="tart">
    I'd like to talk about principle aspects. We have said that an objective measure is hard. It is not too difficult though for two reasons. First, is that a local principal is generally sufficient in that locale. That is, if we are cooking we ought to do so well, as the contrary however devoid from the foremost measure, is by itself clear with respect to this situation. Secondly, is that reason, or rather what our senses confer as being relevant to us, takes situations and their corresponding aspects and tells us which of them are essential. Breathing, water, sensibility etc., all appear as necessary for us to be, and henceforth require no further understanding. "For we may be better off in having that measure as we may consequently achieve more, but being as we are in the first place has no detriment in remaining so." This arranges itself nicely in the first place, as the scenarios which are relevant show their relative principles. "If one were to choose cherry over grapefruit juice, then we could more simply ask as to the point of juice in general. If it were health, then either would be more clear as they pertained to that value, or it may simply negate them. Or, if it were based on drinking fluids, then each would be assessed equally; though, other considerations would still be in place likely, otherwise the choice would literally be the same." In that way, we can look at what it is we need to do, and simply respect what is true based on the situation of that. "If we are best to do some action, then the nature of that action is where we will amend to, rather than nature herself -for the truth of her we cannot know."
    <br>&emsp;Personally, I find that fitness and nutrition offer the most when we explain their principles. For both our need to do these in some way, as well as our apparent frequency in doing them nonetheless, suggests that there will be more profit and good if we understand them at their core. I will be brief. Fitness, accounts for walking, running, sitting, standing, jumping and bracing. At the core of this is our propensity to wish to move, and feel poor if we don't. It seems though that action in these cases will just naturally happen; my belief though is that opposing forces can bring us down. Chairs, beds, inactivity from life's build or other select choices(such as food) dries our nature up. "Where if a burglar broke in or a tiger was after us, so would we be capable. But only by prompt would we do these things, rather than it being something we commonly do." And I would say that having this as our nature is the most rewarding, as we are able to watch, think, dream and know. Moreover, would the rest and fulfillment that came as offers from such ability, best describes how we are happiest being, and thus what is good for us to do -as it provides us something rewarding -or a means at least. As a resolve then, I would say that containing your nature of activity is good, and that refining it is merely of excellence. Nutrition fits in here nicely as well, as her place is meant for the same and banked equally as a worthwhile thing to uphold. To note, that the pleasure one gets from these things in themselves, such as the fresh feeling from running or the satiation from eating, ought not remove the advantage and or point by which the principles of these are staked upon. "Enjoy your days and dinner, but not so much that you are too full to live otherwise."
    <br>&emsp;Specifically though, we can say that what is good for exercise is that which allows for it to persist and bring the rewards. For me, Hatha is what permits this. Simply, it roots us into the ground and imbibes us with gentle strength. Effectively, we are able to be still as well as grounded enough to produce powerful movement. From that, will motions be carried out in a way that more can follow -because they firm themselves in by virtue of the practice being substantial. As well, will the time between not wear us away, as we are steady and true in our rest and preparations. "Here, will the steps we've gained not fall away, as we hold the progress and prime ourselves for more." The principle of fitness then is the lasting abiliy to do it; both in terms of allowing for our natural ability and interests to run their course, as well as defending against any withering away or friction in being productive. "Our root is solid when its base cannot crumble, as well as letting the body blossom and expand -without retreating or imploding mind you."
    <br>&emsp;Practically speaking, the unit of measure here is our breath, as it marks our means of assembly and demonstration. In effect, we gain the most from breathing through the exercises as well as during transitions(for Hatha that is). However, when we do such training is besides that point, as the method of breathing still remains as good beyond our completion of the activity. So, building on that, can we say that stability and recovery expressions through this breathing method will produce the strongest Hathic effect -and thus the principal good for our active nature to flow through. How much you do is not so important, rather that you do some at all -and well at that. Based on the time of day, as well as your sense that it ought to be done, or at most that it could be done and you were able, will see that either type be administered. In this sense, it's as if there is a casing which forever needs stitching up, as well as benefitting from additions and or affirmations. What is crucial though, is that we have the right putty, as our interest in rebuilding and improvement will reward us with efficient success, which will in itself carry us forward with more potential and further realized gains. As if we had a home and some paint, will the clarity of why the former should be treated as well as the experience and sense as to why the latter is effective, will see that we act properly as painters, and earn the sought for reward.
    <br>&emsp;Whereas fitness marks the structure by which things are done, nutrition reflects the engine so to speak, of how it is produced. "In a way, our diet saturates our means and ends, in that we infuse prominent capacities in the training as well as the activities that we are rewarded with." It follows though, that nutrition bases itself heavily on what is appropriate. Specifics aside, we are looking for a general principle. What it amounts to, is that what your body needs must be solely amended to. If it needs sugar, then this is good, or if it needs protein then that too. In effect though, as it commonly occurs, poor choices here leave the subsequent needs out of wack, where the sensibility to have or not have something is pushed aside for the momentary need that is currently best to respond to. This is no point though, rather the reality of the situation. "Principle seems even more important then, for we can at least stake ourselves towards the proper end, wherein the good is done when times are better, or we at least more happily and eventually do what is good in response to times which demand us be pernicious."
    <br>&emsp;The details are rough though as it is very difficult to know what you really need. Similarly to note, is how Hatha is not so clear why it is good and whether your body needs this in particular, or if not so some other. In that, we merely have a well founded and thought through sense. I suggest we apply ourselves equally when it comes to nutrition. In its case, the furthest remark that has sparked my attention reflects how your body has a mass state. This amounts to the kind of needs you have based on the actions of the day, only that our view of it respects the sense of what recent expressions require. Whereas the average of all expressions over a stretch of time more effectively tells what place your at. For example, if we hadn't worked out in three days, then the prominence of our need for nourishment would be low. However, if we had been working out every other day for the three weeks prior, then the base would itself be higher. Practically speaking then, you can see how a moment requires a response, as in a severe case would a marathon require a great deal of refueling and recovery. It is what you have done over time though and accumulated which determines the bulk of the matter. In effect, the higher your base needs the more you will have to intake. Whereas a low amount of needs paired with a moment of severe requirment, suggests that only that brief span be amended to -as the whole is quickly pleased.
    <br>&emsp;What we are trying to avoid is eating too much when we need too little, as well as forgoing nourishment when our baseline is higher up. Again though, the moment should be preserved, but the day not be amended to as if its needs were the same. "What is best for Monday comes from the actions that followed Monday prior; whereas the choice action for that evening is based on what you did in the earlier afternoon." This is generally a good understanding. Specifically though, will we say that starches are very filling, whereas grains have more room to grow. And neither is better or worse necessarily when it comes to the whole, only that starches will fill it up quicker. "And going over, in particular, is the harshest thing to error at." For the moments, if extreme fatigue and or resistance is expressed, ought more protein be down; and if this drain is one that marks a significant - rather than a brief moment of intensity- then the caloric burn that occurred ought to be accordingly dealt with. Smoothies, many oranges, dried fruit or bananas fit that bill of replenishing fuel. And if a moment needs none, than an orange, almonds or kale will do -with carrots, and later on a smoothie, being suitable for after portions of the day. In that sense, would an off day following a stretch of intense training see the resting portions during the day respond better to ruffage and lighter foods, whereas starch and heavier grains would still be appropriate during the evening(when we nourished the base).

 <div id="amend">
    For many years I see us living immediately. Following that, I see more control to target more long term ends. However, it is most evident that our life will not appear to have improved unless we get more from it. Naturally, the steepness of this line is fairly slight when we're on our own, but its heading is generally up. A friend though, or illegitimate impressions or praise, will bank it more quickly, as in these scenarios we are more drawn. Reaching this point is tricky. Foremost, is that if your further investment is into lower and unsustainable things, then that end will eventually fall away. On the personal end, you may otherwise find more true and genuine dealings with works and efforts of a higher kind: their attention can only receive so much from a single person though, nor is it as seemingly important as the world lays aside. Worth noting, is that there is a reasonable sense of community, seeing as we are people. Removing our aim of grandiose praise or delivery, or remedying the worries of far off acquisition, our simple efforts that merely come from ourselves can sit in both a comforted and communal state, 'as our place is already amidst the people of the world'. One way of looking at it, is if you were by yourself but saw people around, who also were doing their own unique things, then to all could confidence and security be gained, 'as during our own intrigues and work, there were others around doing the same'. At the very least, we can be confident that even in private affairs, the world proceeds around us. The point then is that good work need not be sacrificed if one is in that private case. Their strength and ability to see, will result in a dignified course of kind of conduct, as well as being pleased that their personal direction is not a deserted one. "Man is always there."
    <br>&emsp;Coming back to our issue, is in the improvement that this proper course would have if other people were directly involved. As if we were architects, does that worldly mention affirm the stability in which the worker is placed? There is only one builder though. Humanity being around however helpful and comforting, does not directly contribute or care. For that we need friends, or a genuine interest that is. And this can be tough as the kind of work that seems favorable is not one that most people lean towards. Part of me then sees that our course in life will be one where our private efforts conjure themselves as to draw others in. A friend may be found along the way, or many in fact, but the situation will be the same. For other people to care and or get practically involved, requires from one or the subsequent group to be impressive. Know however that this is only so we can throw ourselves in. By the virtues of stability, we are in most ways made, simply trying to live. In that, the works, pieces, ideas and or creations that we mean to contribute towards, require less money than time. Our efforts are ones of generosity, formation, tribute and design. And the world in which we are inspired by along with the molds we erect as a means for our treatment, only require time, attention and care. Tithe, or the income from a patron is merely additional here, as if it were more fuel for a fire that would always be lit. Helpful indeed, but were looking for more direct involvement. "Those who would actually roast weenies and mellows over the flame."
    <br>&emsp;On these sentiments I have two things to say. One, is that my venture to describe this path and its ways is merely reminiscent of my clarity onto the things that I wish to treat. Currently, we are in love with Aristotle along with great film. Games sit there too as do our roots with training for nourishment. These elements of our lives increasingly cement themselves as those things which were generous towards. And in seeing so, I am merely stating how it would be improved if there were people of a similarly generous build. That isn't to say that onto each piece that this is where that person leans, rather that they are attentive and resolute in general - regardless of the specific way. In that, I am looking to find those other people who are ordained within creative piety. "Of others who worship are what I call a friend. Neither the end though of those treatments is what matters, nor are you my enemy no less. 'It really is just about whether or not you care'." This reflects the aim of the second point, but of its route I will first expand.
    <br>&emsp;Of great importance is that we constantly adhere to ourselves. The simple reasoning is that if we had friends who liked us and we were comrades to, then being out of line with who you were in this situation would reflect 'riches of a poor kind'. That is because, for example, good words and great deeds are only worthwhile to those who can read or see them. "In that sense, would a currency from a country that did not domestically apply, be quite useless." The practice of this wabbles in the following way. One discovers the reason to live; moreso, do they imbed themselves into it and become rich with personal wealth and cheer. There's no one around though. "And more or less we could describe this predicament as one where there was no one to share the bounty or load with." So, you venture back, or into rather, ignorant lands where others reside. You say 'hey, come with me, I have something great to show you!'They may humbly oblige, but also may feel uninterested. An issue arises then that if you sought to demonstrate an example let's say, of the goodness that waits, you would likely find that there was no suitable place for this reasonable expression to be done so 'in this land of ignorance'. Therein, you may bend to the local ways, as to learn their customs. In this case, if we meant to spread the word of Jesus in a foreign country, then we would likely learn their common language as to spread our doctrines with respect to that. What you may find though with goodness is that it is easily stained by relative badness. That is to say, if you learned Chinese to share an idea through that, then the English roots in which it came from get easily swept aside. "As they say, you must avoid or imitate the crowd, for the fairs of either are lost in each end." It is worth noting though that regular exposure to reason solidifies it(so to speak) in one's bones and mind. In that, it is fair to expect that some accommodation can be made to the local ways, wherein more effective communication and display can be made regarding your own local goods.
    <br>&emsp;That is one element then, in how we are going to draw people to the land of reason. A second issue though is that just as your roots are baked within your domestic product, so are the others. And just as you maintain who you are at heart when foreign lands are approached, so will these residents of Ignoria when they land in Reasonville. That's not to say they won't care for the weather or appreciate the food, but their heart and palate is otherwise ordained. Here is the important point then. Regarding cooking, we learn local delicacies so we can fit into a new locale. In this example, we may wish to reveal ourselves as a chef, as to encourage the locals to come and try your brand of food. As a strategy, you learn to make their kind of food so that their interest is sparked onto you personally, and are then fine to see what you otherwise have. Regarding reason though, the details change. For one, this land of Rationalia is really just an assortment of thoughts and their practice. Whereas the food of an English chef is sure to satisfy the tastes of those familiar with Taiwanese, the folks of Ignoria will not so readily and happily be drawn to or oblige the goods of reason. What it requires is an impressive display. As it goes, reason provides rest and cheer; however this is hard to convey through your private affairs. Consider who we are as creatures though, and how this tempered soul and mind realizes itself as its strength becomes outwardly prominent. In the case of man, it is industry, generosity, creativity and design that comes boldly forth into fruition. "And as a mark of the character and kind that reason produces, gives much credit and appeal to those who would otherwise see it as pretension and cirfufity."
    <br>&emsp;The point then, is how this builder builds. As we said, we are going into an ignorant land, like a missionary would, and asking those besides the doctrine to come and see the good that it can do. This is a flat remark, but what have you actually so far done as to legitimize your claim 'that reason is provident?' What goods in fact have you uncovered or materialized? And to which ones that you had, did they come easy, or quickly mind you? Moreover, if they actually had and your stock was abundant, do they forever remain, 'or does reason require consistent care herself'? My point, is that in leaving your post as to find potential interests, as well as the accommodations required to 'speak to those of suiter's land', you soften your abilities and place as a builder, as well as slowing the progress of your personal display. Better said, will the creation that you leave at home be good enough when you return with others to see it? Or would it have been better to remain at it and profit by another means? I believe this is the proper way. In fact, the principle of monumentality fits perfectly here, in that if you forgo the mission outwards and instead focus on the goods themselves, the grandeur and promise of these efforts will speak for themselves. "Build it and they will come." What this means is that if you focus on the work, and to the ethic throw yourself in, then by virtue of the product you'd expect, those around could not help but see it. This seems more lasting and favorable then actively trying to get others in, as upon arrival you have shortened the very reason that their attention was meant to bring.
    <br>&emsp;This is more or less my second point. The first being that the ideas and care that we have, sees the good in embracing those on either our own or with other people. "It is simply a line that is right and proper, and bettered by others; removed though if it itself is replaced with another direction: even if that new route is done well itself." In other words, the right thing to do will readily support and smoothen the goodness required to reach it, as well as the goodness that it provides. "For that is what makes it the right route, in that we are most able and rewarded for doing so. To that way we'll say its whole." Then, that second point merely says that the means to that improvement will simply come from being the best version of ourselves. Instead of looking for other routes that we could do well, or trying to show off to others what you have become, simply be the good that you wish to show. For that will be the most evident proposal as to why goodness should be the one. "And in that, are we not still fine on our own."
 </div>
 <div id="living">
    For our course we will die. We are currently living though, so to that end I merely anticipate how our time will be till then. Morseso do I reflect on how things have already occurred, and use those to furnish more accurate estimations along with more reasonable values of what I wish to obtain and avoid. Now, for me the right kind of life is always one in which you are actually living. And seeing as an abundance and regularity of this is important, then brief and occasional highs are unideal. Instead, for example, we can indulge in writing, study, reflection and or other creative means; be it in war movies or great dramas, immersive sims or skill based shooters, there is a piece for us all. More than that, can we see others treat these things in their own way: these are the creatives. In this day and age they are everywhere, from pithy little comments regarding philosophy on Twitter, to more interesting and rich discussions on Youtube. "And all other kinds for all other pieces spread abundantly between." Furthermore, it would seem that our interest here, in activities let's say, is such that the amount we care and our ability to be thrown in, determinans the resulting satisfaction. On the former, if we think about particular things then we can find more worth in them, or, more likely, can we share interests with such things with comrades and friends, 'wherein the value of a group is formed'. Here, the height of the appeal rises significantly for each one involved. Moreover, does it encourage self attention as well as communal support regarding our capacity to be generous through these things. "In that sense, if we care for a film, then on our own we may simply recognize its good and(more or less) silently respect it. If this thing is cared for by a group though, then not only do the basics of your attention feel more substantial, but further investments and care are placed by virtue of you being drawn; as well then, would the way in which you contributed towards this, be it in analysis, criticism or pure reverence, be brought and cultivated by the helping hands of those others around you. Together, all of these eyes on some thing makes it more appealing and accessible to abundantly treat: which is where we live the most."
    <br>&emsp;It must not be forgotten though that our selection of interests ought to adhere to a measure of 'regularity and ease'. That is, we ought to be able to do the things we like often and simply. "For our lives are not meant to have momentarily reached the highest point, or within a given duration do so for an instant, then come back down to a point best characterized as 'nonliving'." By virtue of our engagement and care of things, will we be wholesomely satisfied and fulfilled through the various actions that we do. We'll read many books, write many things and discuss much; moreover, will we train and refrain so we can be more well founded and wise in both our desires and fortitude. Occasional and brief vacations, the glory from impressing others, seeming clever, rushing to be seen, these things and their vain consequences are no lasting measure for what is truly good. "For the end which they offer is eventually minor, and irregular at that." In this case, ought the interests of ourselves and our friends be onto those genuine things. Moreover, would our relations with the former reflect our own stake in the latter -as to come together on something good and worthwhile. Seeing as we are looking to spend our time well, makes us in a way restricted from doing poor things with other people. "For even though we may be supported and drawn, still will these activities wain."
    <br>&emsp;Conclusively then will we say that something is good based on its nature. what we are right to do then, is line ourselves up with those things whose good is substantial and lasting. Therein, will our amendment to that mark the soundest way, even if some other indulgence or excitement seemed more appealing: for what it offers is a mere moment. "And we are looking for lives, whose range themselves accounts from beginning to end." What we must understand then is that it is to things which we apply ourselves and thus our measure of lasting goodness. In that, will we be wrong to choose things that fit otherwise, even if it means we are left doing the right thing by ourselves. Again, even if an action is one that draws you, and moreso are you able to have the company of friends, that this end or activity is not sound simply from being so -and such friendship is otherwise a fortune, for how many truly ordain themselves to something well? Within reason, what's offered must be lasting and accessible, as well as cooperative to other interests, rather than draining the rest of the whole. "Ought we choose things which allow us to be drawn and productive within other things as well. Foolish ambitions or exciting events, however harmless or acceptable, may in fact work out of line with a host of other things. Seeing as our life is meant to be full of goodness rather than briefly experiencing it, then the whole of our time that need be filled must be done so with things that fit and nourish eachother. However pleasing and or sound a particular thing is, we ought to see it as it is with respect to our lives. For it may not seem conducive across the board of other things. And we are best when that range is full."
    <br>&emsp;These are our values. Not only do we hold them, but we practice them too. And in seeing so and feeling the strength by its effect, can we say that no other choice or obstacle is worth detouring from this. The road is open in front of us, and this is our reason for movement. "Not only does it take us down this path, but it also determines the smoothness of the ride." For as we get more comfortable in the seat and acquainted with the wheel, so does the terrain feel more even and leveled out; moreso, can we see more as we travel along. This in total feels like a worthwhile fair. "Take me," as Socrates says, "oh destiny and fortune, for in these tracks will I have lived knowing that your end would be reached: and all that lay beside in its wholesome grace and glory, will be my just and gracious claim." Conjuring this sort of attitude within ourselves will see that its principal nourishment and rewards become ingrained and easily faceted into the seams and or proclivities of our minds. With these then affirmed and producing, will the steps we take be suitably great.
    <br>&emsp;It is worth noting though, that the path will call out to you in ways that it would improve. Concerning what we care about, ought we firmly remember that it is not our time and place on the road that counts, rather our destination. "As we said, initial excitement and content for a current path is not what makes it good, rather if its substance is substantial as you go along, as opposed to the common risk of it whittling away." In that sense, it is our reasoning and philosophy that curates our direction. And to the ends prescribed do we say their good, because the result from adhering to them is continually fruitful. In that, will theology and ethics trump dinner parties and soap operas; dialogue in film will appeal to us more than the drama on t.v; moreso, will nourishment be seen as what provides towards this path, rather than the needs of futility. In that sense, the demands placed on us are the principles and machinery needed to operate the vehicle for this path. "What some other end needs, I bear no response. Like a bears care for calculus, only this path is becoming of me". Serenity and ability will reward you from these times. For the profits of the highest kind benefit those in those most assuming ways. "The good route for a beast is one where it can easily survive; of man though, will the goodness we gain from the land of reason, offer us the means to be the greatest version of ourselves, in that an appreciation and respect for this being our path and resolve will sink pleasingly in, as well as rewarding us with the space to be congenially expressive, through industry, creation, friendship and care." And so, cement this stake in your mind for the pure promise of reason and her treats. Bolden yourself from the back, in that you are happy enough to simply go this way. But also have trust, that the riches that you find will extend themselves beyond the initial borders of your learning mind; for upon realizing themselves in you will the light they bring shine further out and high: wherein the borders of reason, like weeds, grow over the fading greens of ignorance. "The residents of which will suitably follow."
    <br>&emsp;Which is how outstanding communities and friendship are made.
 </div>

 <div id="ameasure">
    The heart of any point or discussion is what's most important. If some technical point is missed, so be it. "Let us measure one's expression by what is meant, rather than how it is fitting a supposed measure." Foremost, is the fact that without an objective measure, then all errors of truth are in themselves unfounded. Fully at least, ought a criticism base itself on an objective measure of the world in order to say that someone's conjecture or view was unsound. And to be clear, that validity is merely of the form, whereas this universal scale reflects a test as to whether the terms in use are properly used. This means for assessment though seems unobtainable for those already outside its place. This is due to the fact that if you had reached it, or supposed you had, then you definitively would have come from a place wherein this absolute had not yet been claimed. "And my sense is that no proposal would truly be sound, if in coming from a place of ultimate imperfection that it thought that its reward would be perfection." Perhaps this is best described as the inability for fullness to be reached by those things somewhat hollow. "For in that, the end is already there."
    <br>&emsp;Anyways, what we are trying to do otherwise, or at least what we are trying to contend with is an objective measure. As stated, proficiency marks itself as a sort of machinery, wherein upon its ways a suitable amendment is stained. In other words, within these operations there is a proper use: but without the objective measure, we cannot say which operations to do. We could refine this however by saying that what is better are those things which upon proper use, give us the highest good. That is, if we more or less killed someone, but upon determination did it well, then the good in that would still be lower than the good from being generous and kind. That is why I say, in this case at least, that we ought to tend to the heart of the matter. For in this current state I am unable to say whether being honest and frugal are truly the best, but we can at least say these are more favorable and well elicited than thievery and licentiousness. Additionally, we might say that there is an important point of distinguishing between the propriety of man. That is, we surely must be more productive, consistent, cooperative and sensible, as opposed to impatient, compulsive, irrational and irate. "Again, for the good within the heart of our conduct."
    <br>&emsp;The discussion can be furthered when we think of what holds this medium by which these obvious things act. As we said, these more acceptable traits and or actions seem fitting for us; however, their place is suspended from a ceiling in which we cannot quite express. Moreover, do more refined questions such as mortality, deliverance, freedom etc. case themselves in those rafters -as opposed to comparing the value and use of dishonesty and sportsmanship. Second to those finer concerns, are the natural workings in which even the everyday things of our life spurrs into our minds. Since we are in fact creatures of the sort who are both subject to those higher concerns, as well as able to wonder, it is not surprising that an equal kind of thought is triggered onto the simplest of things. "Whether we should buy this house or that, or choose this amendment or another, does not fair in terms of significance of whether there is an afterlife, yet to each we address them the same." This is unclear of me, but I only mean to suggest that even the normal things within our lives are in need of some scale in order for their respective choices to be deemed in accordance with truth. "For how do you know which one of your tastes for either ketchup or mustard is better than the other? Better yet, as they are separate objects, could you place one in front of the other with respect to the truth?" To that would I say, that neither red or yella is clearly superior. That is because I don't have measure.
    <br>&emsp;One of the reasons this question is so difficult to conclude is that we assume too much in terms of what the answer would be. As we are asking what will guide us objectively, what does the delivery, or rather expression of those suggestions mean? In other words, where is the message by which this truth is known? "Could it be that as it happened this reference of authority was in brail? Moreover, what should we assume the messaging means; ought we translate it interpretively, as if it were a mere bearing against our own inclinations? or maybe we'll adhere to it word for word." Whichever end we take in this regard, it is simply hard to entertain. Foremost, is that we are in most ways ascribing a result that is in fact absent. That is, we have an idea of what truth would be and what it would contain, but we expect too much of the kind of answer given. "It's as if we were foolishly afraid, yet smart enough to ask for wisdom; what should our profit be in regards to this foolish end: is there truth for that, or genuine guidance rather?"
    <br>&emsp;For me personally, I see very little in the way of a truth that we would anticipate finding.
    <br>&emsp;As it is, we deem the reference of authority to be the element or thing which can answer our questions. "The absolute is that which explains all that I wish to know." In my case, I am simply buckled at the thought of derailing this opposition. The heart though, in the matter of me, says very clearly and richly too, that our thinking of both the issues and their end, will clarify what it is in the truth that we seek. In other words, if we put more effort in, then we will not fall prey to that all too common misappropriation of what tool is necessary. In fact that best explains it. An ultimate tool will produce the ends of any prompt, or rather by it all results are given. This we will call an operation. "That to my prayer this mechanism produced. And whereby to the end in which all regularly and fully do so, did it earn the spot of our highest stake. 'For our faith is placed onto that which most giveth'."
    <br>&emsp;Anyways, we have said that right action is that which corresponds to the machine. In that, we are well to take good advice. Here, we have a problem though. What advice is good? For goodness, or right action, is that which complies within the commands of a certain operation. "So if you wanted cheese, then onto the rules of doing so you would so well; and having done so, then to the end of cheese will we say that you were good of it: for you arranged yourself appropriately to what it required." The good then is in how you meet things. The most divisive question then, is whether we are better to personally address the worries and interests as we deem fit, and simply ordain ourselves to do these well, or do the actions we take become choice when they are given as directions themselves. In other words, does the objective authority tell us what things to do, and equally in turn declare that we do them well, or do we determine what things to do, but treat them in a similarly appropriate way?
    <br>&emsp;Discerning so is troublesome. My view, is that the path forward in these respects is one that we are continually out of shape for. That is because a great deal of our best effort here comes in the form of negation, whereby we explain why determinism and preceding genera are weak in their claim for truth. To suggest what is otherwise strong and likely, demands that we employ our greatest means for questioning: the toil of which is the hardest for us to do. For we are in some ways asking questions by highlighting what we don't know; and the struggle is in being articulate and sensible enough to see what aspects of your considerations that you have excluded. By my estimate, and at the very least where I judge myself in coming short in any given experience, is when our intellectual rigor loses the steam and clarity in order to do that. I must say though, that in these foremost states, despite when I run out of steam or when the finishings seem incomplete in retrospect, that more of the world I've claimed. And relatives aside, can I say objectively that our current approach is one that reflects a great deal of soundness and civility, in both the encompassing nature by which these inquiries are produced, along with the genuine candor and process in which these incomplete steps move a little bit ahead further each time. From that I am proud. And admittedly, I cannot say what is true and what is not. I can see it though, 'like a stranger staring at you in the crowd but is hard to recognize'. Perhaps in a few months time we will be better prepped to make more common attempts within this rounded framework. Still, I am in many ways skirting around this integral flame. "As I see it though, our own moisture and ignorant wetness, dampens any embers that, if I were otherwise pure and beholden, might ignite and grow." I must say though that this is why I wish to participate in this quest, for in the reasoning and all its adventure, I learn more and become more ingrained towards the path of being a better man.
    <br>&emsp;Maybe this explains it all: that without that objective measure, I am unsure what that end means. "For how else would I know."
 </div>
 <div id="target">
    If one were hunting, they would prepare and ready themselves 'for the fight' so to speak. Then, when they were aiming at their target, a good shot would be taken. Note though, that this shot was not good because they 'would' make it, rather that it seemed best. However, if they hit their mark then this is success and the hunt seems complete. "We might say then that however unlikely something is definitively, that the end is itself objective, or strictly the case no matter the outcome." The point being, that despite our attempt being rooted in weakness and strength, the result is explicit. Ought we conduct the whole of our lives under this model? I would say no. That is because in that case, for living, the model which we would base our actions towards has no explicit end. Another way of looking at it is by seeing how the hunter, having won his prey, still has to continue to other actions or things. In that, this activity is merely part of living; and so the ends of this species(so to speak), achieves its end differently than that of the base genera.
    <br>&emsp;The reason I bring this up, with that core question in mind, is that at regular intervals I feel as though(in explaining it) that I can take my shot. And that's not to say that our ability to do so doesn't increase or that our soundness in the description fails to improve; there seems to be no end is what I am saying. This is best put in a similar light to that hunt, wherein we see a good chance to make our target, then complete the step to some explicit end. The concern here is that our explanation of life and the model which we base it on, never seems to finish. There is always more evidently. And akin to our limit, I can say that our attempt to bring our understanding closer to completion is an eventual point we will not reach.
    <br>&emsp;Saying why is difficult, for as they say, 'how can you say what you cannot know if you don't already know this'. This is a legitimate argument in most ways. And I don't claim to have an answer otherwise, despite having limiting principles that effectively describe it(our limit that is). To me, our place as thinkers bar us from anything more than measurement. For one, we are not the things that we are measuring, and in that sense lack the constitution of the objects and forms that we mean to explain. Secondly, it would seem that our place as inquirers continually builds itself as we learn more, in that if there was an end that we reached, so would our existence continue; and consequent to this, is more impressions that either A) affirm or weaken the views that we have, or B) introduce new additions or possible negations to our conclusions. "A nice way of looking at it is in wondering where the ocean ends and the air begins, for the waves or momentary splashes intrude upon the space of the latter; in effect, the limits of the prior's body is difficult as the irregularity of its shape makes it challenging to contrast with an adjacent object."
    <br>&emsp;The hardest thing though is to say why it is that we don't know, or will not for that matter. I suspect that there is an epistemological root to this, in that if one were ignorant of what they didn't know or understand, then those inclusions would not be considered in terms of what they felt was complete(regarding the knowledge of something). This seems quite characteristic of ourselves, and well founded in our quest for further understanding. However, I feel as though this outlook bars me from friends, as having little to say yet being aware of all, sees me as both contradictory, out of place, uneducated, unnecessary and, foremost, unwanted because my highest proposal(as reflects my own aim) is one of indeterminacy.
    <br>&emsp;Let me illustrate what I have to say though. For one reason or the other, there will not be a point where all is known, or better yet will there be no point where we'll not have to act -if even all the knowledge were gained. "Truth must be acted on, and is useless otherwise; like a tip that is made to no one's advantage or benefit." We are aware though and with some grasp on the world, especially the very elements and their origin. In doing so, within meta considerations that is, ought we respect that limit of ours and simply build another model. For how is our understanding meant to produce or profit otherwise, less it expands from the heart of its actual being. "That is the issue in looking for these ultimate truths; they forgo the anticipation of one who can see it with the proper action congenial to their nature." It seems that the only one who would enact those highest principles is the maker himself. To be clear then, we are best in being ontological, rather than knowing ontology. For we are either wrong, assuming, animalistic, or thoughtful. And to me the latter is the most true of our nature.
    <br>&emsp;This can better explain hopefully. The good is in proper action; that is, within an operation there is appropriate conduct within the matter. So, in a scenario of piety, prudence and grace are good in that they are in line with what piety requires. A better example is in skilled labor, in that a machine or device has a proper way of using it; whereupon doing so, or failing to and stumbling, would the former be commentated on as 'Good', whilst the latter would confer 'try again' -as to avoid saying that was bad. Secondly, in summary, are the investigations of the machines themselves. Note, that our preferred outcome is one thing with respect to the total of all things, but we can say that an oven, for example, has the aim of baking, of which the act of doing so well will be good for this. The point then, is how do we know what baking needs, or is in the first place. This, as I would generally suppose, calls on the means of science, wherein an object's identity and possible purpose is brought into question. So if we had a large iron blade, a sharp piece of metal that is, then its use could be of military or decorative kinds. Now, to reiterate, whether one should be done over the other requires a higher understanding of what things one ought to generally do; in this case, we are merely explaining that in either use case, this is how the object could be appropriately used. And I would say that we can base these illustrations on the fact that we are creatures of utility. "We are not making the mold for reality as to make the forms act and arrange, rather we are trying to see how things are in themselves, by virtue of our opportunistic curiosity."
    <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, through analysis we can see the use of the blade. At the very least we can say its operations are derived as such as they appear with relevance to us. "For a pile of gold might otherwise be viable as a paperweight. 'Though King Midas may himself seek an opportunity with that." In this scenario, we could describe how our tools of analysis were merely such, in terms of what's useful, by further understanding what a thing was in order to see what it did. Two thoughts come to mind. One, is that by being more detailed and focused, on the sword let's say, then we may become more capable in wielding the sword(by the use case) as well as employing our construct capacities to a greater effect(by our resourceful mean). Secondly though, we may discover that its main component was iron, and that it itself can be smelted into other use cases. In that sense, by virtue of our curious nature, an analysis aimed at bettering our use of an object, may in fact allow us to perform and or manufacture other objects. A good example is the lightbulb, whereby its benefit from lighting our nights, also saw further understandings of how light worked itself. Consequently, direct advances in electronics were derived, as were accompanying advancements in engineering and physics.
    <br>&emsp;To bring this to an end, we can say that beneath the proper use of an item, or the proper display within an operation, is the understanding of what the conduct is, what would be useful to us when we operate, as well as alternative devices and or routes that become beneficial themselves. Herein though have we reached our limit. Or mine at least as we'll say. For at this point can I only decipher and explain the metrics of desire and avoidance seemingly conducive to us as people, but an objective measure seems otherwise a challenge to claim. I wonder though if there either is one, or one that we would find useful or consequential, compared to that earlier sentiment that we could say sufficiently defines what is good for us -as we would commonly expect as people. "Perhaps the lord's aims are other." But if we do not know that truly, then would the reach of our opportune casing not mark the point of sufficient regard. 'Wherein all that sat beneath did so with proper respect for what they are bent towards doing, to which we could then soundly amend?"

 <div id="ofdivision">
    A body of water is a strong analog for how primary substances operate. The word melting comes to mind, in the sense that if a volume of ice cream were melted down then its constituent parts of milk, cream and sugar would become the substances. In water’s case, if you split it, or rather divide it, water remains. That is the idea more or less. To be clear, water, as is the case for any molecule, would either be broken down into its elementary particles(and radiation) and so forth: but we don’t say that water is elementary. Strictly put, a general body will hold itself upon being split, like water, but equally transform its shape and type whilst remaining of the kind. A blanket, or cloth for that matter, illustrates this best. Simply, if the blanket folds, hath the material stayed? Of course it has, and none will disagree.
    <br>&emsp;Here is something to consider then. Guided by the fact that nature appears to be fundamentally vibrations, regarding matter that is, then as a blotch of water here or a fold and wrinkle of the cotton there, is the principal layer by which these vibrations come to be not merely this base foundation knotting around and turning out, but doing so without dividing or loosing its kindred claim? For, just as there is liquid water and nitrogen, so there beith the strings of an olive garden branch, or a linen rope; the point being that by that primary being or substance, that its imaginative engineering, as to whether it moves and curves this or that way, or in this or that fashion, continues and lastingly does retain its act of being genera(or of the same base kind). “And do not all the genus’ by that token, duly exhibit their proportions by virtue of that? I feel as though there is strength in believing so.” To further note then, ought we at least address the necessity of this blanket, or at least its constituent place amongst other potential beings(of contrary nature for example) or even as to how this primary cause remains and heeds itself as so. Perhaps it may be divisible, or, in other words, that there is more than one principal material. It is fairly possible. Note though, for the sake of forwardness, that being singular and specific in how a mere body of individuals can be woven and stitched, sufficiently explains the ostensibly whole matter that we see, wherein we can likely explain wherefrom it followed. The idea at least of indivisibly and genera seems to offer a more or less prudent beginning.
    <br>&emsp;Let us summize our proposal then, that the folds of reality make what seem to be true, what they ostensibly are. In that case, the base element is one, however unfolding. Principally, this is true because it does not divide. And moreover, as our heart in this suggests, that all the peculiar things that we see are in fact one, and merely the ends of that ever making mold. To that, would the genera that holds all our kinds, be in fact not so, for it was no holder to anything other than itself. “What makes this true is the division of water, whereby the separation of it does not change its form. And by that, we can reasonably suggest that the unchanging arrangements reach their particular end, whilst being constitutionally the same. And is there room for God in that. I simply wonder.”
    <div class="qu">Considering what this is about, that is the heart from me</div>
 </div>
 <div id="divisibility">
    Let me delve into a topic -as opposed to fretting over the meaning of things. To preface, if one separates an element and finds that there are only adjoining elements of the same kind, then we can say that this is of genera, rather than separate species. The common example used is of water, wherein a dividing of it maintains its place as water. In a similar way, would swirl ice cream be broken into two separate kinds of vanilla and chocolate; flavor wise though, would each of those be their own kind. Now, just as two bodies of water are the same kind, so can they rearrange themselves and or configure their shape in differing ways, yet remain as water. One way of looking at this is if we shape a dough in a circle or star, the kind remains. Only if we add another aspect of 'kind of dough with respect to shape, flavor etc.' does a division take, otherwise they are merely arrangments of the same thing.
    <br>&emsp;Now, what I suppose is that the primary element of entirety has merely configured itself in the ways that appear to us now. The key point then, is if the constitution of all things are the same, differing only in arrangement rather than kind, then each object is only ostensibly different; this is by virtue of it being rearranged rather than its own unique kind. In that sense, an apple and banana are the same thing fundamentally, separate though in the arrangement. "Again, two bodies of water are the same kind, but may splash this way or drip down that side, of which there is a difference in the figure, but not the form."
    <br>&emsp;Now, there are many suppositions to this. One, is whether this principal element accounts for all that could be, or if there is negation of it. Technically this refers to its contraries, but more interestingly is the assumption of nothing. Imagine if you were in the ocean, looking for fish or sharks perhaps. If you looked around and saw none, you may say there is nothing there. What about the water though? This is a clever issue in that we are merely prodding at the idea of some aspect which lies outside our principal grasp. However, the question bears the only merit here, as we are not so clear on what 'something' actually is. Nevertheless, it pays to address whether there is such thing as 'no thing' at all, or if that principal element in fact protrudes to all. "We ask though, for where is that bound? Less it is infinitely everywhere, then are the points where it's not merely so for it lacks what is principally so: for that though I do not know, and lean towards the fact that I cant. But I can suppose and or ask -hence my limited intelligence." We could follow this with many inquiries as to the nature of reality, in its compactedness namely. But a more pressing issue is at hand. We have said that we know for the most part what things are, how they can be used and that doing so well(with respect to the operation at hand), marks the point of goodness. We have also noted that understanding which operations are best to choose is a challenge. Worth noting though, is that our quest to define such measures and their corresponding end is effectively a means of reassurance. This is because we can already say that idleness is poorer than engagement, as is honesty superior to deceit. The problem though is that we cannot know completely: and people make little effort without clear guidance.
    <br>&emsp;The main problem as I see it then, is that where we presume to hold the answer feels irreconcilable; that being our description of God. This is only the crossroads though. Because I, being sound and wise, can truly see in a wholesome way, that peace, tranquility, natural amendment and commendable success are worthwhile and sufficient to achieve; just as I can say that gluttony and larceny are irrefutably bad. "My discretion at least says these are appropriate values, as my palette rightfully hungers for nutrition." I make no claim that these are true because it is what the world demands, or what God would command; rather these are the insights and discoveries of one in touch with reason and themselves. Better said, in regards to the things relevant to us, we have noticed and tended to those which our natural faculties and gifted strength prefer and wish to avoid. "I need not God's understanding or approval to take my hands off the fire." Bringing things back to that point of ignorance, we can offer a useful alternative. For what it's worth, I think those values of content and satisfaction, as well as those vices of frailty and sloth, are worth amending to and or resolving to avoid. However, I do believe that doing so from pure sensibility is below our threshold of capacity; that is, if the primary being ought to be known for a general principle to be instated, then I feel as though this measure can be effectively defined. I do hesitate at the thought that our attempt will be incomplete, but I think it bears strength and thus I'll proceed.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, it is that idea I've stated. There is no God, prior reason, true absence or ability for intervention. The world as we see it, and in turn who we are and what we interact with, is merely the root layer of being arranging itself in different ways. Why it does so is beyond my vocabulary; still, it is not the interesting question. What is paramount is in regards to this view of divisibility, whether or not the need for prior reason is necessary, as well as the present ability for intervention to occur. Put another way, in terms of siding with one view over the other, does the merit and or strength within their ostensibly being the same things lessen the strength of reason preceding matter(and its consequences), or is there still an effective requirement that this uniformly generic being had a precedent as well. I am not entirely sure. What I can say though, however sound my premise is, is that the matter that would come from this reason is fairly explained by this view of divisibility. And all I would say then, is that whether it was brought into being itself, or if there are commanding and intruding rules of what proper conduct is, I would still take the Protestant way and its subjective determinations. That is, if there is God, that his place within us is a constant benefit regardless of our actions. "More or less, that whether we believe or not, or otherwise steal and rape, heaven still waits. For God intends it for us no matter the case." This at least can be comforting, if not a removal of avoiding one's sensible claim of real human flourishing. And again, I cannot say strictly whether those claims are true, nor can I really say what God intends or demands that we do, but I still have a place as evident of the times before.
    <br>&emsp;Personally, I see no problem or glaring weakness in defining my view of the world otherwise under the guise of attentiveness, reason and the resolutions that follow. In fact, the only element that has me concerned, is whether or not my end will treat me to the blissful nothingness and rest that I look forward to and expect. Perhaps it is that latter part that renders me wrong. As I do not know. Which in effect conveys my concerns; for how could anything but overwhelming strength or brazen certainty protect me from doubts regarding my foremost desire? "I suspect that it is assuming that the opposite of this would otherwise happen." Frankly though, I couldn't believe that some favorable end wasn't guaranteed. For what sort of God would penalize one who merely sought to be the greatest version of themselves, regardless of whether they were ignorant or bound to the measure? As we have said, goodness is in how you do things, no matter the task. And personally, I have grave doubts that God so strongly cares about being orthodox; or at least I greatly expect that goodness at heart will earn his approval.
    <br>&emsp;In summary, I think that end of congruence and praise is how the ultimate measure is well explained. "Which items fit the scale though I do not though, for I still can't proclaim who holds the lever
 </div>
 <div id="ostentation">
    Here is a theory of everything. A rock exhibits its purpose by the actions of its characteristics. "Wherein its nature is in motion, and thus to a targeted end." As people, our chief trait is intelligence, that is we can think and inquire. In this way, our purpose will be brought out when we have understood the world. In the same way as a runner has much to go if they are merely average at it, so will we assume we are incomplete if there is knowledge left to acquire. An interesting point however is that the means by which we partake in this action is one of discourse. In this way, we are merely discussing things, as if they were subjects of our investigation. Another point, is whether or not a completion of our discussions, in that all things were known, marks the place in which we were done; or if we ought to use the material that we've acquired for some other end. Or maybe, be it from a limit of learning or the unnecessary fact that we would even completely know, that further action would be worthwhile at all. Moreover could we say that seeing as our rooted kind is through inquiry, that if that bowl was full(so to speak), that further action could not be done at all. "For, definitively, the mark of us being complete, corresponds with there being nothing else to do. More or less."
    <br>&emsp;A not unimportant as I see it, is how these discussions are made, for we do not know everything already -hence our purpose in doing so. However, in a practical sense as well as what we would think sound and just, is how we are meant to progress from incompletion to so. This to me is the hardest thing to explain. I think despite this that an illustration can level the ground. As we have said, all things are ostensibly the same. That isn't to say that there is only one element, rather that all things which are not of that primary status, are necessarily derivative. "For if they existed otherwise, then they would clearly be primary, as you are or you aint." Now, in our discourse we may ask questions about this principal component as to whether it is material itself, has dimensions, a body, or if it's a unity or plurality, has contraries and or accidents etc. I must divulge the issue though. Take a sphere and consider its volume. The basis for it in terms of the length and width, portions inside as well as what the object could not otherwise be -as to lose its uniformity would make it oblique, who would become more sphere like if its own ovalness became more uniform. Now, take a bunch of spheres and put them together; now you have a body of spheres, an ocean if you will. Imagine then that these units arrange themselves into peculiar ways, so much so that a complexity emerges so far that vision of these complexes are seen. Can you see how both the viewer and the products seen are merely those baser units rearranged? In that we say that these higher objects are only ostensibly so, as who they are housed from is ubiquitously fundamental.
    <br>&emsp;What is most important is in how our discourse can address the 'nature' of this primary being, while also considering how whole elements lack any of those aspects. What I mean is that a derived body has no genuine measure, in either its material or form. "It is merely a product of those core elements". Additionally, could we clarify by saying that arrangement means nothing more than bodies of the same kind. "As water is the same whenever it is split." The point though, is that beyond our theoretical position of what this primary component is, do we forgo a great deal of eligible consideration if the subject in question(more or less) rests above the level of genera. That is, how there could be a form of the principal, or variety in itself, or quantiy of sorts. This is so in reference to our spherical model, that just as the bodies in which these units are arranged, so do the containing aspects of the sphere itself similarly break down. "As if there were a statue of bread, that upon splitting apart revealed itself to still be bread, yet those same portions were equally derived from water and yeast."
    <div class="qu">The foremost question then is where does our refining end, and where does a proper address of the primary being begin?</div>
    Where discourse comes in, is that it means only to better explain, rather than purportedly know. In other words, we allow ourselves to have proportions, quantity, necessity and contraries of the primary being for the sake of consideration. True wisdom and articulate strength would then seem to be when one can decipher which aspects of these are true, a simple example being the unrequired factor of accidents. And truly we may not be able to fully say, but at least within our descriptions and address, can we speak more firmly and sound about which elements and or aspects are fairest and ripe when it comes to those principals which are otherwise unknown. In doing so, will our illustration of the world from our point of view, reflect it appropriately in as much as we can see what it seems to be. "For we may not know God or what he is fundamentally, but we at least know that he(or one of the kind) would not(or in any case could) be contrary. And that just seems reasonable to suppose."
    <br>&emsp;With all that being said, if we assess that our end is one where all is known, then the form in which that would take would necessarily suffice for completion to be reached. And in that sense, would an explanation seem fair as the mark in which we were credited. To finish so however, does seem to require that the basis for the operation in which the end is reached, is itself adhered to. This is why with discourse being that action, that a removal of all factors as to remove ostentation, feels inappropriate, while wisdom of there being ostensibility feels sufficient as we otherwise address the primary elements as if they were whole -as opposed to singular in aspect, which is most difficult to know.
 </div>

 <div id="propiety">
    This may illustrate the whole of it. Too much do we pull away in both the front and the back. In the latter, we try and find the specific workings of all things, whereas our best effort would be to simply address how you feel and what in that regard is favorable. On the front, we forgo assessing things from the stance of their place amongst those values, and instead we look ahead to find an answer that will declare which things to do. This seems foolish, as we eventually will miss the mark of the congenial goods that we seek. Otherwise, we end up making a portrait of someone whose merit lies in that they could tell us what to do, rather than actually being insightful. Or, we look too much inwards, and fail to see the simple nature in which we are trying to address.
    <br>&emsp;As Buddha had truths that pertained to living, so will we consider our truths as those values at the back; their essence is to the subject though, as what will amount to goodness varies. "If pleasure was preferable, then some might like sweet and others spicy. To each and their own then, will objects be judged as good so much as they fall in line with that." In this sense, we are arranged a certain way; the truth though is that the world in which we live and the context in which our assessments address, is of humanity and its offerings. In this case, we can assume our standards as general so that we can more simply reflect on the medium by which our nature participates in.
    <br>&emsp;All I mean is that our regard for what goodness is lies simply in the common areas of food, training, careers, family, leisure and death. We need not understand the roots of this congeniality, or rather why these things are so relevant to us and attuned to attract in a certain way. In that sense our only place is one where we are reasonable. In this case, we are merely applying our time to find things which fit us the best, and the scale by which we use is merely sufficient if it is the best one in place.
    <br>&emsp;The highest ethic then reflects that highest principle of seeking goodness, with the soundest resolve then being a true assessment of both the subjects that we attract as well as the truth in the mold. This method bases itself on the nature which we have. If we were more primitive and innate, then our response to the world would be of instinct and compulsion. Our discerning efforts onto what would be better to receive goes then in harmony with the consent of things which we have similarly assessed. This removes the foolish mistake of using one's reason to achieve lower aims. Instead, ought the things that we do reflect the rational nature by which we apply ourselves.
 </div>
 <div id="forensics">
    Discourse, whether private or personal, effectively describes itself as the means of explanation. When we assess what things are in themselves or regard how things can be or came to be inherently, we are explaining. The reason that it is called discourse is that we have to address the point we are at as one who lacks the answer; consequently, we must disregard certain things and give more credit to others so that we can progress. “Looking at things requires that we speculate and define, so that our estimates and qualifications for truth are employed towards a proper conclusion.” Discourse then simply demonstrates how we use terms and subjects in a way that satisfies the heart of an explanation. This is not to say that it is true, only that we are using the tools we have to paint a better picture. “And it may prove more favorable to merely splotch the brush and give it some highlights, then detail every leaf on the tree and bush.”
    <br>&emsp;Opposite to this is deliberation. In this case we are strictly focused on what we are going to do; and things will be assessed, only as they are with respect to us. So we may analyze the elements of an apple, and address how it as an object is meant to be, but to us it is a flavourful fruit and treat; moreso would we judge it as a kind of nourishment, to which we resolve ourselves towards. Discourse would better explain how we are as things in general, and that since we are natured how a nature’d thing should be; that we seek rest and are averse to aimlessness is determined by us though. Thats not to say that our roots of desire and distaste aren’t rooted in something fundamental or that they could not be explained, but we are not trying to learn so for the sake of discussion; rather, we are looking at the apple as nutritious because we experience it as so, and are thus deliberate on where and how we’ll use it.
    <br>&emsp;Another way of looking at this is that discourse merely helps us to understand things, both in a particular sense and one overall(in which those particulars fit). The problem though is that our wish to learn more and find higher principles can prevent us from directing ourselves in a proper way. The idea is not complex, but if our heads are turned so we can see the truth behind us, we may fixate on it too much and forget to bring it infront for actual use. To me, the important note is that knowledge and its means through discourse is effectively aimed at truth: this amounts to what is objectively right and wrong. However, what is good or bad is quite easy to determine. “By our inclinations though in experiencing rest and joy -as found in things, of which we oblige- despite us being ignorant of what is actually correct.” Moreso, as our thoughts turn inwards rather than outwards, will we see a great deal of conflict in acting outside any objective measure. The point though, is that the ease of our breath and lightness of mind, is a mark of something favorable and good, of which we can amend to no differently than our ignorance elsewhere would promote us to steal and lie. The absolute scale does say what is right and wrong, but only that we know our resolve to live well and die easily is true. “Even though by this token, for our lack could crime and lechery also be suitable.”
    <br>&emsp;What I have found though is that the deliberations I have upon myself reveal that our own needs are not placed in that ultimate demand, nor is it one that my reflections suggest we are capable of achieving. As an admission to all the logicians and philistines(who I don’t equate), I will say that my resolve here is not one that is banked on truth, only reason. That is, we have come to terms with ourselves, and as those insights regard matters such as ontology, death, liberty and pain, do I merely craft pillars and frameworks around those central matters: the heart of which centers on me. I don’t see them as true though, rather as rafters that allow for our senses to determine which is appropriately good or bad, only on a local scale. That is, satiation, and of a fresh kind, is of my favor whether I know it is true, or how. “It’s my philosophical attempt ot exist profoundly, in this lil world of me.”
    <br>&emsp;Put another way, my personal inquiries have revealed to me that a natural death is promising and acceptable; on top of that though, have I flattened out any bias or ill foundedness that may otherwise be had in the quest to know the actual truth of it. And again, I will not say that it is ultimately true, nor will I correspondingly rest with the utmost certainty that it will be the case. However, my senses tell me that the trouble is for those who wish to prove otherwise, and that my common place is one that more ordinarily rests in that natural position. I may be wrong, but those actions within my own affairs are where my actions go, with confidence and strength mind you, no matter if I know.

    An important feature of any thing is that it has a right way to be. This is because, depending on the characteristics that form its nature, will it have some end or being that is congenial to it. In that sense, the inanimate life of a rock gives its being an impermanent state. Whereas an animal is almost definitively more actionable. What is important then is detailing the scale by which objects are suitable for an entity. How it works, is that externals sit outside a subject, waiting to act upon it as a response to its attraction; that is, if the subject wields it, then the attraction will be one of craftsmanship and skill -as if wielding the handle brought the blade into submission. In other words, the man, or subject, attracts an object into its practical use.
    <br>&emsp;Another attraction is one of compulsion or rather innate response. This amounts to the objects around impressing themselves onto the subject, who then replies with a response that reflects their nature. A clear example is that if you put a monkey in the cold, it would shiver, while a penguin would appear content; obviously, a naked man would be colder than the former, but the bodies of each are arranged differently none the less and thus respond differently to what is impressed upon them. I use the word attraction then in the sense of a mold, or vessel. The world imparts itself onto some entity who takes in the expression and materializes it into an intrinsic response. "The heat comes in and I am affected, wherein I feel hot, can address so and speak, as well as discern between the slices of this experience; relatively speaking, any point could be considered whether it was more or less of something, or rather one's attention or potential experience no less, could align itself by virtue of possibility into a state which reflects the current arrangement and those that are equally plausible."
    <br>&emsp;The basics of this are extremely complex, in the sense that temperature is nothing more than matter vibrating. And so when we say that a man is startled by some noise behind him, we ostensibly say that his senses were alerted and his body sprung him to action, but molecules and hormones specifically are at the heart of this play. Moreover, are the constituents of reality and their fundamental reasons for acting even more basic than that. If you look at a plant though, you can see how its components functionally convert sunlight and CO2 into sugars and necessary products. Now, the nature that caused this is one that similarly results in other entities acting in their own sort of ways. There are many kinds of plants, cells even, and so are there further arrangements of those. Imagine then if a path of arrangement led to a point where there was innate sense. That is, if a rock hit the ground and made a sound, or was melted by molten lava, that the reaction would not simply be broken sediments and the physics of sound and heat, rather the rock was aware that it was happening. What if it could see it, or hear it, speak about it too?
    <div class="qu">In that way has man come to be</div>
    Unfortunately, the products of those senses is a wholehearted mess. For even if we can agree that we are seeing, and that we are speaking too, it is not so clear on what we have to say. On one hand, we have made great strides in reducing the need to act at all; that is, we have flattened the curve for our need to address the world in necessary ways. Living though has been removed. On the other side sits those who try and assert a guiding principle, as if that presence of living is valued in itself. Yet they only reach for the answer higher, and falter in the fruits they seek. However, there is a worthwhile remark. Just as heat is really vibrations, so is that living which we truly seek one that more simply reflects a lack of idleness and frivolity, and is full of joy and rest instead. Moreso, could we describe the needs that those wishing to beat survival seek, as an avoidance of stress, injury, insecurity and discomfort; while those within the higher principles are trying to be more collected and arranged around a path and its end, as to bring out the goods they seek in a more assuring and respectful way. The only difficulty is in knowing whether we should act with this model in mind, or if we should display ourselves in some other way. Ought a reasoning man reflect on whether breakfast is good with food or freshness, or is he better to concern himself with how all things generally are. "Is an absolute scale required to determine how right our intent is to eat eggs, or not?" That is the troublesome approach here. That if we don't know how things act principally, then it is hard to be specific about ourselves and the objects we treat.
    <br>&emsp;However, it seems nearly impossible, or at the very least impractical, to describe ourselves and the suitable actions by their constituents. "What should this bag of carbon and bone do on this earthwarren ultraviolet lit day? Maybe I'll use my stomach acid and saliva to break down and digest a mixture of fructose and polymer, or maybe I'll be egregious and use my skills of respiration to intake nicotine: oh how would I enjoy the stimulation of those neurotransmitters!" A more simple example might be that a service would offer(and in effect equate) their products in terms of the dopamine received upon satisfaction. Or, assuming it would taste better, that a waitress would ask if you wanted more pleasure with your coffee. Commonly, it seems we address things, as opposed to their constituents. And this seems for the most part sensible. What happens though when our choices come short, or we are selling ourselves below our potential? How do we improve our benefits and remove any errors? Moreso, if we are thoughtful, how do we merely foray into the lands of reason and take her fruits for the benefit of our experience, "rather than worrying excessively about the analysis of principals and objects themselves?" Even more than that, how do we arrange ourselves so that our inquisitive means are towards things which are truly good in innately? "Less bureaucracy and innovation be spent towards cigarettes and fast food satisfaction."
    <div class="qu">A general qualification is that the good and the bad in our lives equal up; that is, experiences amount to moments, however long, and they are either of some severity of favor or not, along with adjacent qualities such as eventual outcomes later on -while our present anticipation is of the moment itself, whereas the truth in that event is more primary</div>
    Returning to the starting point, that things will affect something naturally. "As oil and water don't mix by their natures, so will too little oxygen impact ours." The ground floor is worth addressing, only generally though. We don't need to consider that we breathe oxygen, or what sugar even is; these are arduous tasks and difficult pieces of knowledge to apply. What we must be concerned with is that all things will act as they are made to do; and we are an arrangement of those things, with various functioning organs for example. And in that sense, we must assume that there is little which is forgoing us, as the fact that we have a nature suggests that other things are filling themselves into the mold which the arrangement of our nature makes. Inquiring then into the ways of that nature, can ready us to proceed in ways which give us more personally, as we can see what things are good for our kind, and thus advance in a way which is congenial to their arrival. That last point is key. Why we should not ultimately address how we acquire food, get sleep, stay active and engaged, then freely die, is beyond me. You might consider though that these demands are usually responded in a forward way by us. We move mountains to find more grain, destroy nations to become more secure, and prudently eat and train as to get better sleep and earn more rest. Can't you see how our compulsion is to act as our nature has ordained? "That skin cannot be burnt without a cost is representative of our nature; it seems only sensible that the presence of that also has a means to avoid this, so that if it is burning it will move away."
    <br>&emsp;The point I am trying to make is that we are always doing something, at least things are happening to us. We are trying to survive for not even our stubborn minds could proceed or assent to no air or food; a lack of action though also sets you into a weighed down state, as if you have no more lift. "It just seems like there isn't anything that we are not doing." We are always in motion, or mildly so, or at unease as the mildness becomes so much. With all of this action then, it seems right that it would reward us with a result proper to our nature. As our body feels at rest when it is free from danger, as does a relative amount of relief come when there is no longer pain, or the source of it has been removed at least, so too will the complexities of a well formed and mature life yield you with the same principal sorts of pleasure and content. The thing is, is that our time is more bent towards the latter. We cannot settle into the satisfaction and clarity that comes from the troubles and concerns of primitive times. Our path is free, with nothing but the fear of idleness or responsive tradition ahead. What is better is a hard thing to say, yet we can generally agree what it is we'd assume. Regular joy, righteous confidence and regard, safety by virtue of personal and civil respect, and so much more. All actions ought to point us towards this, at least we may describe what is furthest and highest as having these attributes present.

 <div id="beginningsend">
    Pardon me, but I am no academic. That’s not to say that I don’t respect what people of science and education do, rather I am merely a thinker. In that way, I may speak about things that they formally see or explain otherwise. Philosophy is a good example. As a branch of learning, it technically means love of wisdom; in parts, it is formally split into metaphysics, knowledge, logic, ethics and aesthetics. For me though, I tend to use these elements as they particularly are, and regard philosophy as a general care and approach for thinking. This in effect runs contrary to what ‘a’ philosophy is, in that it is a systematic approach to understanding the world, that usually defines itself on the basis of those prior elements.
    <br>&emsp;To me however, such a complete end suggests that you haven’t cleaned the table. “For how could you confine everything in truth, if confinement hadn’t been done already? Who holds the mold!” The limits here are themselves implicit, but I can say that history more clearly illustrates the picture. If a model is to accurately reflect living and the world, then it will be perfect when we say that its depiction is complete. Definitively, elements of a perfect entity can only be shifted around, not altered. “For if a dress flaps in the wind it is no less perfect; if a spill hits its side, or if an additional strand is added, then the form of it has changed.” Now, we can see how past models have been added onto or adjusted, or simply made anew in the vision of the old; or an original one at that. The point, is that even though Aquinas and Kant had all rights to claim and or be praised as sound in their thinking, has more not become known. Or, at least, have additions and developments not been made? The progress of Aristotelian thinking namely reflects the former while phenomenology, psycho-analysis, modern physics and mathematical logic appropriately reflect the latter. What I mean, is that the advances in chemistry(per say) by those great advents and discoveries in the enlightening world, were not in themselves a complete view of the world, chemically.
    <br>&emsp;The most difficult thing then, as a limit would be in place, is how can one know or see if more additions are to come. That is, how will we know if our model is complete? One mistake to avoid is in addressing our state of progress now as one which will sooner or later reach a state where the advancements are done -as this really just amounts to the same. A conditional question is useful then. “If we are to be finished with a complete model, then no more alterations will be done. We may lift it up and spin it around, rub out some cracks and refine its edges, but new parts or restitching will mark a new form.” Importantly, we must recognize that those further alterations may be in fact regressive or progressive. “As the Greeks attempted to understand the world using geometry and rational consensus, so did the religions that follow make their own additions and form using millennial scripture and custom. We can at least say that these are at most complete on their own, but incompatible as being the correct view of truth. For there can only be one.” That is perhaps the proper portrait of these thoughts, that is, what marks the correct view of the world?
    <br>&emsp;The question though needs more refinement, as we must be clear as to whether we are trying to explain how things could ever be and how they came to act and form, or if we are trying to assess what is good for us to do? There is a murky line as I see it where one thinks that if the answer were known, or the view was correctly seen, then proper action would ensue. Two core problems arise from this thinking. One, is that we are in some way giving ourselves too much credit by thinking that an accurate model was placed before the embodiment of truth was known. And Secondly, that upon acting upon this model and ingraining its experience, that more would not become impressed upon you, or revealed that is, and consequently prompt the change of the model. My suggestion is that there is a better way. First, let’s admit two things. One, is that this line of questioning and insight is merely a mark of discourse; that is, we are merely illustrating the world, rather than defining what all its constituents mean. Practically then, we can ignore the agents within this model, and rather focus on the framework itself. “For that is what discourse is for, to make reason rather than claims. At least these should come after, but are therein reminiscent of resolve. In that case though, ought we have configured a measure.” Secondly, is that base assumptions in our process here will be admittable. For one, we are shackling ourselves to details that bear no assembly to our search for the truth. This is not to say that they are irrelevant to the truth itself, ‘but where paintings will go on the wall is better concerned after the house is built and painted’. Moreover, and moreso I’d say, is that we are by definition coming from a place that is ignorant. Seeing as our quest is to know, then something is strictly lacking. What we need then is an approach which does not halt its progress because either some screw fell out or some flap came off and makes the model unappealing. “Let us construct the landscape from back to front; there, we can develop the most depth, and more successfully add minor additions -as they will have a world to fit in.”
    <br>&emsp;Let’s take these points of guidance under our wing as we advance. As a mark though, the question is here in place. Coming from a place of imperfection, and seeing as we can basically assume that we are mere rational animals who will continue to be so and at most benefit from knowing the truth -as opposed to being more able to run the system, like we were God planning a project- then we can for the most part see what our model of the truth needs to be. Simply, we need to have the best depiction of the world as we know it that marks the best assembly it can be. If truth still needs to be found, we’ll find it; we need not despair or give up because there is room to go. We also shouldn’t bolt ourselves down into our current steps under the notion that ‘these next ones will get us there, finally’. This expectation suggests either that you will be evidently wrong and that further steps are required, or that you are anticipating stopping upon completing the model. “And that forgoes the ethical notion that upon cementing the frame, you’d use it.”  
    <br>&emsp;The basic premise for all of our inquiry though is what is our reasoning for? And I believe that it is only to those relevant that must answer the question, and bear the answer from all others; and is it not the commonly accepted response that the end of our reasoning is so we can better live? To me, it seems sufficient to live with the best model that we have and make use of it the best we can. “For in some ways life comes after learning. And won’t the former become free and flourishing on its own, and in effect disregard the model?” Perhaps then we could explain our issue with or frustration from the state of progress, that we neither apply it or mean to. It is so clear that we are only giving us more time and space to live; yet we never use it. “Like a field built for us to but we never run.” The discussion then can be summarized. Is there a limit to knowledge, or better said is there a point where it can be complete? Even if at heart there is so, then we ought to ask how and when we’ll live with the model as it is at any point. This is where philosophy ends and the curation for living begins: in that, is our nature and its congenial inquiry. “What ought we do now specifically seeing as the measure is done? The end, to me, is worth knowing more than preparing the model. For that latter ultimately comes by those attempting the former.”

 <div id="adultbend">
    Talking about the course of our lives is difficult. On a macro scale you have the whole, which is principally limited, but by virtue of our tissue, tends towards a tranquil end. Still, the portions of this living part can be broken up into eras (such as adulthood or seniorhood), stages (such as young or old adulthood, or one’s younger childhood compared to their youth), then periods (such as the strands of your highschool stage, or infant portion of your kid years compared to those when you could actually run). On the micro scale the largest unit is a chapter -which in effect comes together to form a period. This is more or less a year, but is in any case less than a period and more than a season. Spring and Summer (as seasons) are what we call batches, quarters if you will (of the chapter that is), while stretches mark portions of this, and sets as pieces of those. Stretches are akin to the first few weeks of a new school year, followed by the stretch from autumn till the new years. The first stretch of summer vacation is another example. Sets, are the smallest strands -as we need not account for any given day, or inch for that matter. These amount to moments of your life, such as a week long trip, or a work week in general. A tournament is a good example too.
    <br>&emsp;Something to consider is that instead of purely breaking our lives into these corresponding parts, how could we reflect on our present scenario with respect to any length of strand. This is hard to do as each measure is not purely a point that is marked when surpassed, rather it is more akin to a gradient, or heart of change, and varies so with respect to the distance at hand. In other words, we can work our way up by virtue of splitting from the whole, but how can we be at any given point then look back, and see where each stretch began?
    <br>&emsp;For me, my youth ended when I was about 19 and I had fallen off the whirlpool of juvenile entitlement and resolve. At that point I entered the world and put myself on display. As it stands, I am reaching that point where that mold is settling, or coming to fruition rather, as a viable means of ground floor action. Better said, I am becoming complete, and able as a point of origin wherein full works and efforts can be done. “Put another way, my state as a man is fully calibrated, and I can now live and be from the heart of that -as opposed to using a bent tool.” In that way, our adolescence is coming to a close, and correspondingly the era of childhood. What this leads into is unclear, but I can at least say that it is the beginning of the bulk of our lives: real adulthood.
    <br>&emsp;“Having grown into myself, I’m a man, and in being so can act and instate all that comes from someone able to fully do; and upon our finish of that, will our ending days begin, whereby I retire into the realm of a post-me existence: for in that, had I already been totally so.”
    <br>&emsp;The period is tough, or at least it is much less clear. On the basis that our current stage began when I started to place myself into the world, that can be our domain. I can reflect that a clear change came when we transitioned away from the novel idea of being on our own, to the point where we saw that duty was our fortune. And following that, with the remark that most that followed was positive, I can see how a great deal changed when we started to live more objectively. Now, you might say that if the era is done when your actions are from completed grounds, then so too would the corresponding stage similarly begin. We must be clear though that this point, at least within this discussion, is not one where we then look ahead and consider what we’ll do upon this full maturation. Rather, as I suppose, or say at least for the sake of addressing the unkown, that we reached this state of being who we fully are when we reconciled what that full person would be. That is how our objectivity began, wherein we reflected what we truly sought, and as the period progressed we deliberated how such claims would be executed. By definition -again for the sake of having one- we will say that the man is one who acts fully, whereas the prior stage of adolescence and according period of objectivity, marks the leading strand that brought the pre mature person into a calibrated state, rather than a point where he could ‘then’ be truly calibrated.
    <br>&emsp;In other words, by assessing who we are and how we mean to be, is where we fully become who we are as we are accurately set for actions that appropriatley reflect us -upon which the execution marks our founded steps. So, breaking down this stage of realization, we can say that the one that follows is colored by the demonstration of that fully realized self. And in terms of the prior periods (respectively) of adventure, roles and aims, the one that follows is either actively dressed within manufacturing -by our active lane ahead- or the principle self regard ‘that we are all that counts’, which our actions outwardly follow. “In other words, all that there is, is that which comes from us, the ends of which mark little in terms of what further things you could achieve, rather the solid line of forever being yourself.”
    <br>&emsp;Seeing as this era is one of true execution, we could sensibly suppose that one of the stages will bend itself on the focus of giving. Whereas this current point at least is about us being the greatest version of ourselves, so too will there be a day when that expression is not so outwardly in how your generous, rather to a small group of people, a family, or specifically a child. As we see it, the end of your adulthood is the point where complete actions are done; and so at the point where a mind for others is placed, then so too will this fit in line with our current place. Furthermore, we might briefly say, with respect to rearing at least, that our goal was to guide them to a place where they can be the greatest version of themselves. And not to digress but let’s say that preceding this is a similar kind of attention to others, but onto one of marital affection as opposed to training. In any case, for each let’s say, they are gradients of what mark you giving yourself, as opposed to at first fully being yourself.
    <br>&emsp;Overall, in fully being ourselves, and thus giving to a friend, a lover and a child, will we have been who we are fully. Perhaps the world can follow, but really is marked in the need of a man. As I see, what that means is one who has reached a point where they can fully be to another; and seeing as what the world needs, it is the sensible ability for all to be themselves. “So let’s not be complacent about that in ourselves, for in doing so the world will see true green.”
 </div>
 <div id="sweetqualities">
    Never will an aim be surpassed as our current need. Per our natures, our experience is always occurring, and as a consequence fairs nothing more than what we hope to claim. In other words, that our time was joyous and pleasing -while serving us with regular amounts of quality rest and ease- bares us the measure in which things are judged. “And I say thanks to all those which effortlessly follow, staking themselves in with simplicity and grace, and treating us to a crushing blow of mere cheerfulness and respect. And nothing short of that.”
    <br>&emsp;That being said, we must deliberate about what it is that will bring us down this lane. If we were birds then flying would be our bend, and as such we might see a place most suitable for that as one placed congenially for us. As men, we are rational; moreso, are we generous, pure and kind. As such, we can regard these as our highest qualities; that is, if such peaks were reached and spoken from, then all foremost could be said. It is true that absolute specks fair less than milder gems, but to our top we can at least amend. “By virtue at least, of doing what is right well, even if through an approach that humbly stays premature as to be full fledged then: but still with those truer starting grounds in mind -as we make ahead.” Again, our strongest base comes from a place of reason and tribute, whereby we incorporate the world around, and position ourselves excellently, then bring ourselves forward as if a suited screw for this greatest groove -as made by reason that is. And in being so fit, and for practicality sake with constance -as to lastingly experience the pleasure of fitting the mold- will our actions flower, as if nectar and fruits from the solid bark of a well rooted tree.
    <br>&emsp;“And to all those who would disagree, or condemn even, on the basis that such stable grounds are not worthwhile as our claim, I would say that looking further in will bring even further gains, both in the firmness of the roots, the according base for the tree -and its trunk- and those corresponding fruits and flowers.” Such prominence blossoms beyond a point that can’t be identified, as real substance and shape takes suit, and allows then for sharing to occur. While initially, principles may be hard to explain, and thus encourages judgment or ridicule -as if we were stale and short- remaining clear and set to such grounded ways will bring out the rewards you seek, which can then reflect things worth relating on.
 </div>
 <div id="lushdomain">
    When it comes to identities, our thinking and qualification vary. Prior to this though, there are two relevant truths. First is the principle of positivty, which says that regardless of your aim that something ‘positivte’ ought be achieved. This means that if your a sadist, diplomat, missionary or man, that the ends to your actions should be positive. Furthermore, we could appropriatley qualify this by saying that the results should come regularly, easily and with substance; moreso could we say that as these aspects continued and increased, whilst contrary aspects whithered away, that our positivity was improving. Specifically, if we are cooking, a roast lets say, and for simplicity sake we might say that a burnt one is poor while a flavorfull juicy one is right, then for an instant would that latter mark a positive end, whereas if acorss a stretch of time (despite this initial score) that the results were more like that former, then so to could we say that our results are depleting -and becoming negitive that is. Thats rule one.
    <br>&emsp;Since that was a sound amount of detail, I’ll be more concise in the second principle. Simply, we have no beliefes, only positions. That is, upon any prompt or view there are relevant sides; and to each one, there are strenghts and weakness’s regarding what we’d hope to achieve. For example, are gun rights laudible? Well, defining what the rights are, and what they otherwise wouldnt be, then speaking to their worth (or lack their of), illustrates fully to how the situation really is. For one we’ll leave the identity and value for later. All I wish to say is that when it comes to seeing something as good or bad, it is onyl so for some reaosn, and usually this sprouts from some value, or desire rather, to which the choices at hand are weighed against. Moreso, if we do in fact side with one postion, we can still recognize the nature of the other half; moreover, if our side appears to be weaker (on account of its many weakness), we could still reamin firm to the strenght we had (and how it perhaps outweights the contrary.) It would be as if a risk were being taken, and although the other side offered a route which was secure, that this firey path was worth the reward.
    <br>&emsp;In other words, this is a considerate path, although one which is not fully developed. That is so because even though thhis method better explains the ways of the choices at hand, so too our we premature in our actual decision. Commonly, people are moreso in oppostion, and to their own side stubborn, rather than having made a weighted decision. The background though of the subjects in question paints a better picture, as seeing as they are for the most part political, our vote seems to be action at hand. Conversation is important, but only so more genuine votes are casted. And so by your own token or that through the influenece of another (or too them), ought it come and go by real education, or sense rather onto the topic in question. I say most if not all of this because there seems to be little real discussion at hand; and although I admitt that our own sensible views are not being put out there, I also dont think myself absent from the chaos in question. Instead, I ought to be bigger and better, as to shine brihgtly yet sincerely, and in that provide room for a proper disucssion. “I dont feel bad about being to imperfect to overcome the mobs: and explicity I claim that taking part with that aspect, is random and at best awkwardly revlent. And the path to something finer (and impactfull) need not share that path.”
    <br>&emsp;I guess, in short, when it comes to a proposition or some favor you find in something, it only amounts to a strenght you find in it, or (as if it were an alterantive) it lacks the weakness from something else. In part, and perhaps, the coward in me rests on the laurels of fidelity, whereby I claim that knowing completely is uncommon amidst your awarenss of yours and others strenghts, and weaknesses. “How else could a position be had.”
 </div>
 <div id="boundofcontent">
    What is best? Well that clearly means what is the most positive experience. “Or at least, absolutely -whereby a slant against would be equally not so- what experience is (more or less truly and completely) positive.” For one, the relevant answer angles itself according to the subject at hand. “A positive experience of a shark is that it would survive, and at most thrive.” For men though our condition is the same, yet for practicality’s sake the concern is even further. As it were, stability has accrued, of which our industry should be commended. But whereas we fought against the elements in order to live, this at most meant that we were alive before death. But now that this escape is absent, so too does our path lead to the same end. However, whereas before we were engaged with getting by, now we are in a sense waiting. And from this life seems pointless, as the absence of struggle gives us nothing to do.
    <br>&emsp;Man is a tricky subject, as all other species fall into the category of surviving. An important point is that when they are safe and situated, they graze. The crux of our concern falls into play then, as we in our similar states feel poor, whereas those of the herd (chewing cud) feel suitably docile. The simple reason is that whereas those in the mud rest happily above their core need to survive, we (increasingly) sit back into such passive living, whereby the freedom above -by virtue of danger’s absence- dangles her active hopes ahead. For the cow is not really absent from death or danger when he is wandering the fields, he is merely in a place content with the present moment of lacking alarms. In other words the stress is coming, and thus peace is ever appreciated. We on the other hand have little that crosses our way; at least, things to do with us that scream with apparence when their lacking. Though, hearing about the world illustrates nicely how such passivity is hard to claim, and that upon that, grazing would be favorable. That is neither here nor there, as we are talking about a well footed place void of the perils of tigers and famine. And at that point the query rises, as to what we are going to do. “For unless we see such freedom as temporary, then waiting is off the table. And if the road ahead is expected to be clear, then not driving on it feels idling and stiff.”
    <br>&emsp;The question I have, is whether it is alright to be content with me. Ought I run forth because the world is so free, or should I cultivate the ability to live more on these stable grounds? I am of the utmost belief that each side really hopes for the same, and that the single measure that defines such end is sincerely represented by that latter statement. As it were, we are trying to be ourselves. Whereas a fish is complete when its gills are running and its stomach is full, so to as Man, are we in line and checked when the saturates of our mind leave us without any sturring, and instead a wonderment of cheer and awe, grounded to. And as such, our peace and tranquility, evenness and strength, solidify us as being the right way. “For in other words, a looseness to such completion would be appropriately described by a lack of said qualities.”
    <br>&emsp;And so for the sake of expression, running wild and free may bring a larger kind of measure; and that if our world is truly free then so should this account for us really being ourselves. The key thing to remember is that upon that outer advancement, only more will fill the role. And as such, ought we wonder how we can truly be forever, rather than reaching for a point which may seem obvious -as it brings clear excitement- but prevents any sustenance of its point, or any lasting amount below.
    <br>&emsp;Our lives should have width, truly, as this reflects us demonstrating ourselves, whereby in turn our desire draws us to see more, while in the process sharing. Consequently, you bring more to the table, to which others join, and the meal is thus larger and more enjoyed. But we must humble ourselves with the knowledge that such offerings only come naturally, for if we are premature in our push, and in other words forcing the draw, then so too will the kind of things we bring (and seek) be lesser, which in effect allows for the good to be less wide, or lasting -in overall duration or severity.
    <br>&emsp;Our true estimate should be who we truly are, and this should account for the lasting success we seek, and in turn one that addresses their current state. Specifics are important, but we should fret over the knowledge that our wings have fledged, or that there is no one to even share the current fruits. And that’s o.k, for such caliber of ends is approaching; and in turn, the expression from there will be in itself complete, and in accordance broad. If we rush for this happening early, we’ll simply fall over. “And who would be jealous of that.”

    Any end is marked well by its favorable substance, regularity and ease of accessibility. A crucial question though is who we are as to find such things for alignment. In other words, the best fit will be the one which happens firmly, neatly and often. The question, is what sort of screw we are and as such what groove will fit that. Moreover, can we discern this by those generalizations of what any good groove will be: for we may otherwise have to vet murder before defining it as bad.
    <br>&emsp;Now, it is true that culture and tradition raise us to inhabit certain lanes, and that by virtue of our inquiry we may not actually be fit for what is of the norm. Even if something is normally done, it may only be done so poorly and does not otherwise reflect a poor focus. In that sense, I see death, family, leisure and self regard as the crux of our lives. And as I have thoroughly experienced, a lack of respect and or grasp on these elements will produce alternate motions, such as indulgence, deceit, contempt, repulsion, depression and impotence. To be clear, the strands of these segments are not so explicitly poor in and of themselves, only it is all too common that their execution matches the rubbish of the domain; in other words, we may eat and drink well, however poor in quality, but if we are reckless and or stupid about it, then so too do our lesser ways drag us down -as opposed to being pecks and tears in our otherwise well behaved constitution.
    <br>&emsp;A further point of importance is that our respect for the crucial elements of our lives generally bring us away from things which happen to run contrary. As it were, if we mean to live well through fitness, then our constancy and care for that naturally separates us from flattening activities. So in our death, that if infamy and shame were to be humored, then so would it be at the cost of ignoring our truer end. And that pretty much explains it, that things tend to go one way at the cost of another; it isn’t so much that we would prefer to travel and adventure, but choose our family otherwise, rather if we bent towards that latter and heeded those fruits, then so too would our pallet lose interest and respect for the former. Who we are then may be defined as ‘what is congenial for us, to which our mold is described’.
    <br>&emsp;Who we are though has more principle patterns. This is difficult because our place is almost primarily born from an ignorance of these effects, but so much as we have been thoughtful and directed ourselves towards a better way, so have these elements become clear as the root cause. Simply, our breathing and its susceptibility to food, exercise and sleep, as well as the impact (by these) on our seating, strength and activity -such as walking or trotting. And at any rate, we could say that as we drink, so do we train less, which brings our body into a more flappy state, of which the unable consequences cause us to drink because our better means are destroyed; on the flipside, as we run more, so does our body settle into a firmer state, whereby interest and leisure sprout, and cut away from baser desires that would otherwise flatten our day.
    <br>&emsp;In short though, we can say that all these come together, as sugar makes our aerobics shortened, so does our strength incorporate nourishment better, to which in either case the according effect reinforces itself by virtue of the according rewards. I will say though that working to these from that point of family and death -under the guise of general quality- is much harder, as for the most part these baser elements are uncovered by reflection, as opposed to more evident reasoning.

 <div id="rightfullhammer">
    If I were to ask the purpose of pushups as compared to bench press, I would say that one yields robustness while the other offers power. Whether you prefer one or the other is its own matter, but as scales no less or at least molds for judgment, we could say that for each (of the subjects) their purpose is to one, or are at least conducive for those respective qualities.
    <br>&emsp;Another question, regards the assessment of the item at hand, for how do we know what pushups offer, and thus what their purpose is? And to get to the primary factors, we’ll remove for the moment any concern for modulation -as in accompanying elements which alter the pushup. Perhaps the realm of assessment needs its own fortuity, but at the very least we can act from assumptions that cater to our intent. That is, if we are addressing certain exercises in terms of their promise of fitness, then we can discern (by this instance) that one is closed chained while the other is open. From here, we can infer that heavier weights will go well with the latter, while a more firm and and even use of the entire body will accompany the former. By these, we will simply describe them as burly and robust. More or less we can say what each one does.
    <br>&emsp;Where purpose comes in, is when we evaluate each entry by their relevance to our aim. So for argument’s sake, we may have previously considered whether brutish strength is favorable to solid rigor; and coming to grips with the constancy and accessibility of the latter, we lather our grooves with that, which is to say that we make ourselves welcoming and interested in things and their kind which fit this value. Now, linguistically, we may intuit that robustness and burliness serve as useful descriptive measures -as to reflect the care for such strength or rigor. Looking at the nature of pushups and bench press, we can see how the closed chain conduct of the former leads to such robustness (and as such the solid rigor we seek). In that, we may assent to pushups, and as such consider their purpose in meeting the requirements in which we evaluated on. Moreso, we may only do this for the moment, as the longevity of the pushup is always up for re-evaluation, or assessment at least -as its merits may lower, or otherwise offer us poor results which strike us as reason for removal. And similarly too for the aspects of flavor and accessibility.
    <br>&emsp;On the whole then, we can use familiarity and intuition to describe the various objects in the world. Then, as if we were picking candidates, we can weigh them against the qualities we seek -again, with continuing room for assessment and evaluation. And at any rate, we may in fact use our reasoning and wit to discern the actual truth in our personal matter, that is whether or not our qualifiers are wrong. As it were, we are in the realm of thinking, which is to say that our concerns and performance sprout from due regard and care, as opposed to passively (and or primitively happening). Almost by definition, has the prevalence of the latter been utmost, while the former aspect trickled slowly upward. The remains of that which is primitive still coats our modern minds though, and as such warrants reputable means for directing our attention properly. “For the animal still rests inside, nor are we in our best and most sensible moments exempt from the natural limits of organic being.” Accordingly, out we think about the merits of our qualifiers, as opposed to simply being attentive to things which hold up to futile worries.
    <br>&emsp;In our life we are limited. And in terms of who we are in such a range, are we both thinkers and makers, that is one’s who consider and adapt, both in personal and communal ways. By this token, be it on our own or with others, ought we be free and welcomed to live accordingly. That is, if we are burdened then let’s use our strength and wits to overcome it, or bear it at least. And if we are welcomed to more liberal ends, then let us apply those in our dearest ways; that means truly looking up at the stars, or at least being refined and definite onto what (in your sensible freedom) draws you; then, as if it were a problem to solve, meet the heights of your reverence with true industry and expression, ‘all under the notion that this is viable, pleasing, meritable and sound’. That more or less orbits around us as the right directive, to which our reflection and deliberation can persist -whereby we assert more personal and operative qualities.
    <div class="qu">For me, our own life at hand can be best described from an earlier quote. That is, ‘the qualities of living for me are reputable actions, one’s of industry, one’s of pure and cheerful engagement, along with the reverent and or pleasing asides from both worldly demands and environmental beauty.’</div>
    As we said, these are our scales, and in terms of which areas we should vet, or what is otherwise pressing on me as the one with the instrument in hand, does reverence and adaptability apply. For the jobs we have are not truly of interest to me, yet their offer of provisions makes them appropriate to regard. The ends which they support make this so, as the elements and or subjects which fit into our molds of industry, worldliness and cheer, shine as the righteous lights which warrant such sensible amends. “As I say, being gracious for the lands and world around is quite easy, when in fact my mere presence earns me the living and stable means for those given ends.”

 <div id="basisforends">
    There ought to be a word which remarks the incompatibility of some action, and thus a relief of feeling inferior or halted at heeding it as a desire. Perhaps that is what wisdom is, but still a distinction can be made.
    <br>&emsp;We say with great confidence that all aims bank themselves on results which are regular and of substance. Simply, a contrary subject would be that if such qualities were not in place. This seems a mark of intelligence, as we are being quite considerate of what our life and time would be in general, whereas wisdom seems more like a siv, whereby we run things through this measure and see how they hold up. In that sense, wisdom evaluates based on our reasonable scale; science however, or that which investigates, identifies what things are, and we as well, so that their flavors can be properly placed, and consequently assigned a measure of worth.
    <br>&emsp;I will stand on this, and feel no problem in casually saying it is necessary, but just as there is no real good or bad without some sort of scale, so is their depiction of this without a nature to a host and the objects around. If we identify candy as being full of sugar, and of the crumby kind, how is this in any way poor to those who would not incur irregularity and coarse substance? I’m not going to say a rock has values, but for example the rawness of meat is acceptable to carnivores, yet for us it is not. Would we say that such a thing was inherently bad? Well perhaps with respect to the one affected by it, but in that we must know who that is. We know by what’s evident that a lion can eat a gazelle, while we (with some evidence but intuition no less) realize or are at least fine to accept (by that probable suspicion) that eating such a thing in an equal way is false. Wisdom doth seem like a string which would lead us to where things obviously go. Our assessments may in fact be wrong, but this does not change their use, for if we deem it to be a ceratin way and in that there appears a wrong connection, then we’ll avoid it. This calls on our investigation to be well founded, and for practicalities sake angled on our shortcomings in being truly so, to which we can humbly amend -or at least find ways to determine the accuracy within things.
    <br>&emsp;Case in point, whether we see it as divinity or natural resolve, we will act, and perhaps if we are primitive then so will those accordinlg sensitive, color the mold which means to be filled. Judgment though seems to easily put the two together, for if our baser impulses are given the regard, and our deduction concluded that dirt was the best suiter, then we’d try it at least. It would follow that convincing yourself that it was in fact sweet -when the staleness in your mouth proved otherwise- but the proceedings still follow.
    <br>&emsp;I’d reference Descartes’s early notion that men lack nothing more than the application of reason, as opposed to how much reason they have. Our minds may be dull and quickly jump to an end, but this is more likely to result in the basis for our decision, and how well we decide what things are. For it is true that things may be conceived poorly, but not strictly against a complimentary impulse, as we may in fact seek righteous ends -or at least ones thought about- but our inspection as to what is congruent may be false -or poorly founded at least.
    <br>&emsp;And so I sit here not with the mind to tell you that choosing an aim or aligning with what seems preferable is an opportune action, as I already see you living in this way. What we must do is erect a higher caliber of sensitivity, for on the basis of what’s regular so will the desires of our baser natures fail. “Seeing as they are in most ways definitively bent towards what is quick and easy.” And too, that if we are even so, that we would be true in our inspection. It seems that all things have an apparent nature, even if we haven’t identified it. But I imagine that if peace and probity were not defined as our sought for aim, then those things which we’d adhere to for some other end would not in fact last. For we may be idle bums who respond with an intention for business, but which lasting and sincere end will this produce?
    <br>&emsp;Considering the well of genuine desires, ought our resolutions lean towards that? If excitement and gratuity is all we seek, for it may in fact be in contrast to our meek frivolity, does it stack up on those baser commands of regularity and substance? For even if moments of improvement are gained from these avaricious ways, are they constant, fresh, reputable, of worth to others or the regard you have for yourself? As a model, I care not whether it’s linear, for in forgoing so we can root ourselves in those basics of regularity, surrender to the flavors of solidity and evenness as compared to brazen strength and burliness, and congregate around the world and its ways which respond to this, whereby those which are good are those which we determine to fit by those purer qualities.
    <div class="qu">At least we can assume what the scale is, and measure those around</div>

    There is no war. Even if there is, it is merely a strand on an otherwise free garment. The world is fine, economically, environmentally and culturally. Issues will arise and proclivities will cause friction, but our resolve will outpace them.

Recreation or not, the mind cannot be taken, as my being with it is not reminiscent of inhabitation, rather it is me ‘and I am it’.

 <div id="rockyworld">
    The world is a bundle of rocks, with an atmosphere in part because of the way it formed. Whereas it now has trees and oceans, other local planets do not. Through industry, such places could be inhabitable, but there is likely no indigenous tribes. So for now, we can say that Earth is our domain.
    <br>&emsp;Statewise, the world has advanced from major civilizations spanning whole continents, to more segmented republics, or nations rather, which border eachother akin to a puzzle. For some time, historically at least, there was fighting between these as there were between the empires of old, but those days have settled. The point being, that you are likely a member of one of these states, and usually at home within a nested province. Moreso, are you part of a territory, and a region within that. In a timely manner we may often travel around to this extent -along with brief ventures past those grander borders- but commonly, our life is lived in neighborhoods. Again, work may have us commuting an hour or so, or perhaps for the sake of some excursion, but otherwise we probably at most go to the store or dentist, or friend’s house too. In that case, we live in districts -which act as the parts of a region- and admittedly our lives may extend past this -for either demand or leisure- but is generally for a moment: the heart of our day is spent in our home, or nearby at least, which is stated by a neighborhood and the particular block of ours on it.
    <br>&emsp;Now, merchants can travel those higher borders regularly, as can those of official status; their business is merely that though, and however novel and fair the destinations and adventure are, their accessibility to such is rooted in the occupation to do so. “And as a point of reason, that being joyfully engaged is worth more than a heads down trip to Tokyo.” That is the far of extent to it though, as people may otherwise have crafts that they’ve made lucrative enough whereby they can venture around -for the sake of inspiration, or scenery to work in front of. And this is nice, but almost nearly as local as ours. It is true that entertainers and (more or less) journalists -and content creators of the sort- have the freedom to be where they want and do as they please -within their bounds at least, for simplicity, but their roots are dug deep within constancy; and so the thing which they do the most (and often) is really the heart of their effort and reward. So, even if they can travel nationally, or simply around the province, their work is carried with them. And so, like the merchant who brings their billings with them, so too does this artist and creator. To be clear I prefer the latter, and as a bearing for what would be good in our lives, of it I see a fair end. But we must remember that it and all other kinds of completion take time and devotion, and that in being so removes the childish center of our lives, and instead places the onus on us; or in other words, we are dealt what we have locally, be it stable or moving, as opposed to believing that our destiny is to be spoken, or rather (simply) that who we are at heart and kind is what will be heard and rewarded, as opposed to the sensible place of you being with yourself -and those close around.

 <div id="integrityofdepth">
    Take a disc: well consider this our area, or plot rather. Now add some height to it, as if we were making a cylinder. Concerning a metric, we might say that each slice is according to that, be it a year or a moment. Now, consider the earth (of recent times) and its occupation by man. In one area, say France, you could see how the slices progressed from the Germanic tribes to the Gauls, then into Renaissance France and the Post Napolean Era. If you asked what France was, you might respond with what it is today. But imagine if you asked a person who they are, and that their account withheld, or at least gave no regard for their prior development. You might as well say we’re baking a dish, and it’s almost a bit hotter. No, we’re cooking a steak, but as a full one, that’s what we mean, and so as it hits the pan, it is becoming something which even upon a further step of progress, remains. Better said, becoming 10 counts up from 1, but 2 still keeps the aim.
    <br>&emsp;I say this because, geographically (and the according societies) at each point there is a pillar which runs down. Land wise this continues for hundreds of thousands of years, and even though the pieces of the plot eventually change, so does the fact remain that slices above and below are laid. Now, as we said you can take a ring, from China let’s say, and carry it up from the Shang till the Republic. This seems sound in regards to China on the whole. “And being wholesome reflects how well were founded.” The criticism offered (and applicable) to most, is that they A) forgo such heights of consideration, and instead take a slice appropriate to their claim, but two -and to me most importantly- they don’t fail to make this mistake across the whole of the plots. That is, if we assessed America by its place in 1850, Russia in its state in 1922, then added Iraq in 2000, then at different moments we’ve particularly selected. This is an intellectual afront on two sides. I’m not saying we have to account for particle physics in our cooking class, but within the subject ought we be layered -or topically well founded. Secondly, is that across the sum of our lives, ought we be so topically sound at each point. For how could we have a credible worldview, even despite our soundness in one area, and have disregarded the rest? It would be as if we scouted a player in the fullest wayoffering not even that fullness to one-, but(still) left the other candidates (or members at least) in a less concerned fashion, or not at all. Again, to do with me as the player, I am enough, or at least as much as our attention centers on me. But for the team and the sport in general, holes make for equally solid views.
    <br>&emsp;I say all of this because regarding history, were flawed, and the sentiment surrounding race, economics, government, religion, crime, violence and war, philosophy and simple well being, ‘could hold not much more than air’.
    <div class="qu">Which is why we’re so full of it</div>
 </div>
 <div id="mindormatter">
    We simply want to live good lives. Doing so however is no easy feat. For one, it is because we are questioning things prior to their execution; and if I may bring up a root problem, that is whether the principle place for our time is in setting up for better days to come, or living them. “And as men we must be fearless of the fact that we are common, whereas the ability to succeed both is in the realm of God -as he is both mind or matter.” As rational animals though we could say that were more set for the latter, even though we wish for the former. The solution arrives though on that notion, as it is quite common and clear that it is our misfortunes in such material times, that privies our mind to find freedoms of a kind according to that. “It is not for the sake of remedying those mistreatments though; instead, we conjure imagery of a place which would be free and better, of which we illustrate and define as being through the mind -and thus within the realm of God.”
    <br>&emsp;Our reason though tells us explicitly that we are clearly being dishonest. For the pure fact that there is a great way to live in this world, one of which removes the preference and place of such unworldly claims. Banking ourselves on this is perhaps our strongest choice, as our inability to administer our stake under the notion that its frame is within the world and time, makes our place in it bitter and vile. Moreover, will an alternative only appear as pleasing, and drawing to, as well as being the thing which we resolve towards and hope to achieve. For the sake of argument, let us say that either end is true, but with respect to what any course needs, so too will we apply the rule to those. And foremost, or definitively rather, if our bend is towards the realm of mind, then your place in the world will correspondingly recede.
    <br>&emsp;Away is how I would describe it. While on the other hand, our stake within the real world may in fact be limited and brambled, but is into ourselves that we go as much as this is so. In other words, bends describe a slant which sees no farther than what’s right up the road, but the path is unclearly seen. Our wish though is to proceed that way with the hopes on offer. If that route is unworldly, then we are becoming further away from ourselves, whereas the approach towards worldly matters is a central one, for that is where we already are. “Less one thought that their advance to heaven was not from a lower level.” And seeing as those according wishes usually come from the ground -for the aim above- then so too will we see then that our hopes to achieve wonderful living of those material planes, is one where we simply settle into where were presently at. For me, that wish for Mind over matter is one where we reach beyond ourselves. And the impetus isn’t wrong, nor would we say that an otherwise oblige would not require strict maintenance. But even through our doubts and all that our ambitions bring -regardless if it is of Eden or the world’s spring- so too in this earth warren pasture of green, do we settle into ourselves, as if our discontent is reproached from. And as God is meant to be given faith too, or in other words the gifts of heaven and surety of man in this realm is not to be taken for granted -or overstepped upon- then so too will our rocky affairs task us with being gracious and humble, hence the reproach beneath our discontent. However, the thing which is true for each, is that upon appropriate advance and treatment, will the person gain what they actually seek.
    <br>&emsp;As far as I’m concerned, the claims of that worldly promise have been given relatively small definition, nor has the alternative been given any genuine criticism against the fact if that former was true. Arguments against theism surely exist, but they’re merely saying that such ends could not happen; but there merely denying it, as opposed to saying what it runs in contrast to. And as much as they do, they fail to illustrate those truer heights in comparison to those peaks which are fabricated.
    <br>&emsp;So what could we say in some sort of summary? Well, it is clear that mindful resolves are in contrast to those of real being. The thing is, is that the latter’s ends are ones of real action, while the kinds of the former are mental. The problem, is that we are still best to think about the means and ends of the world. And so, whereas the affairs of the environment may press themselves upon us, and thus encourage us to look towards some further place via our mind, the affairs of remaining in the world still come with their lower concerns, or reasoning that is, but onto them we are meant to go. Wisdom is a good example here of how poor choices to do with real things cause us turmoil -and the according shift of direction- while frugal, generous, kind, and timely actions avoid such maltreatment, thus keeping us content with the world. Furthermore, is it safe to say that we are not Gods considering whether we should remain in our mindful realm, or transition into that of the world. We are people, mammals, creatures, of matter, and our recognitions are merely through and for the world, however directed onto themselves and corresponding extensions.
    <br>&emsp;In any case, we are generally rooted by our hands and feet, of which our reason guides us. Whereas industry and self reflection can appropriately guide us to use them for a fruitful end, so too we may turn such regards into the realm of abstract ideas -and those corresponding interests. That is why we say that such cares are away from us, as our nature is placed on the ground, and in which our senses operate. This also suggests that even though our mentality has strictly material aims and according aspects, that the otherwise whimsies of worlds and or matter within the realm of the mind itself, seem somewhat faulty and conjured by those baryonic senses.
    <br>&emsp;The question then, is if we have aims for the mind, then our thoughts are directed towards that, but if our stake is of the world, so too are our thoughts towards that. And whereas the path of the former generally fairs one the tasks of patience, as if the illustrations are promising their vision to come, our earthly intent has business for us right now. Or for practicality’s sake, all the time before the priors offer could come to fruition. It must be noted that the heart of this organic path holds it to be true that our death is fair and tranquil. Now, I say this for an important point that our regard for how we proceed in a worldly way, is either banked on the solidity and comfort within the according regards, or if it is more forwardly set on the activities and treatment within the world itself. Put another way, our mind pictures reality in a certain way. If we see it is natural, then we know the end is easy and similar, though our time before can vary. But just as those who believe in God and heaven may feel apprehensive and constricted at the process of reaching it, so too can the man of green, in a contrastingly positive scenario, still be at most confident about the world, and be free from its discontent. “To that earthy heaven though, and the actual graces that its active offer places, that is the front of our minds view of such realm. And the key question is whether it is fine to be spiritually alright through the materially calibrated path, or if it is the actual sights and corresponding gaze, that marks the fuller view.”
    <br>&emsp;It’s really for you to find out and deliver, for whereas those lighter ends have supposed consequences and conditions, our ends are the same. Our place though may not be any more absent of the struggle which pushed others to approach that former, only that during their retched time and preview of paradise to come, their advance and excitement is at least pleasing and positive. The challenge is in figuring whether natural resolutions should be similarly conditioned -in that their hopefulness was the mark of satisfaction- rather than actually experiencing the world’s good. For, as I see it, those in these green pastures who are unable to see it, may in fact have more relevant preventions to them being otherwise pleased. “Whereas those who are religious may in fact be naive and foolish, but still pleased and graced.”

    So deductive arguments may in fact be limited, but our use of them reflects that. Unfortunately, it is clear that a disagreement about this flattens both my local and broad appeal, or at least my perceived station. This isn’t so poor, but our future comes into question, or the use of our time rather. These are not so poor when you consider the course which has been identified, but sometimes that route is not so clear, and demonstrating it to others feels appealing; but that scenario seems neither appropriate nor fruitful.
    <br>&emsp;Technically, my error of deduction is in presuming the axioms are correct. Moreover, it is strange that deductions take place as if in an ideal world, but then mean to apply themselves in the real world. That latter can be identified, while the former is transcendent. Still, we act like it’s true, and for good reason. If an identifiable object moves only by some cause, then so too could we imagine that all things came to effect by some starting cause. This brings to light the concept of causality. The problem, is that within the real world, ‘cause’ is not so correct, or at the very least is best illustrated outside that classical view.
    <br>&emsp;The problem, is that if I say that God caused everything because everything needs a cause, so would I reply that only within the idea of ‘cause’ -and its corresponding effect- does this idea reign, as objects themselves are not so bound by the way that term is used. The point though, is in explaining how a result occurs, which by standard definitions is referred to as an effect, while in more accurately identifiable ways, it is at most effect like, but not so in a linear sense. The causality argument that gets through for the sake of theology, marbles the cause and effect in such a linear way; and its weakness is that it assumes that the terms and use of them are being done so properly. I’d say correctly, but in which way is not clear. For we are not Gods, simple. We are merely inferring, or deducing rather, how things are ideally -or perfectly that is. But in that way, we are not giving enough credit, or rigor that is, to anything beyond the simple line of cause and effect. And seeing as such a line would not describe identifiable things appropriately, then I have two conclusions to make. One, is that however sound the deduction is, that it speaks at most to the sheath of reality, rather than its instances, or objects rather. Holy books and what not may be claimed as such instances, and thus true guidance, but at the very least it does not follow how objects are and what we, as inquirers, should do, by deducing that there is a beginning and God. Even if we concluded an afterlife and doing the right thing, of which operations and how is not so clearly given. The second point, and baser one as I see it, is that the deductions being made are ill founded based on their conceptual root born from objective things. As we said, the cause of one thing leads to an effect, and the meta (so to speak) of causality begins; but as we said, real things aren’t suitably described that way, and so -by this second point- I’d say our use of causality is wrong. Results speak to it better, just as entirety describes literally everything, whereas many otherwise presume that ‘the, or our universe amounts to that’.
    <br>&emsp;I think that deductive arguments will always rest outside our valid measure, as their worth is almost beyond doubt, based on the relevant use by the minds considering them -who would consider them as if full, within their bounds, however limited those bounds were, and thus their concepts. But I wouldn’t offer an inch past those root deductions, as however untrue they ultimately are -as we said, beside their local truth- the past point of particular truths -regarding our actions- fairs less so exponentially. This could be angled as a deistic rather than a theistic view, but the point seems irrelevant. The contrast to these deductions is an action, by our actionable nature, sprouted from identifying reality, of which we are part of and a member. Practically, this doesn’t extend our reach beyond our obvious regards, nor is there any ground to introduce ill founded motions that run contrary to that. As a man, my breath is equal to my death, and so when I sleep or find a state of ease, so will eternity be tranquil for me -by our being safe and sound in nothing. The motivations to prove otherwise come from ignorance. And even if they were born from inquiry, and as if a warning to say that such ends were in fact different, I’d say based on what. We could build past these points and concern our deaths as if their essence was no longer identifiable, but the silliness is creeping in, or at least the poorness in claiming how such state is in fact properly identified. For me, referencing reality suggests it’s nothing, nor does my right place in reality drag me from accepting it as so -in fact, if it were even untrue, I’d remiss. But, conceptually, how is one to really propose what such end is like? We can (faultily perhaps) use eternity and causality to prove the necessary existence of an uncreated creator, but this is in a way just mathematics. “Where is this well founded point about what will be built or calculated (on those numerical grounds) coming from?”
    <br>&emsp;A rational animal happily accepts everything, as superstition, absolutism and (more or less) principle eternity bubbles up from the scrutiny, holes and fear in our mind, so I care not. But even if I did, or (which I do) invite those opinions and reasoning, I’m still lost (and waiting) for any point (for that matter), and a good one at that, where the course of our life is uncovered. It would be poor if we just said that we should live well, and even if we acknowledge our place as animals, that assuming what goods of those there were, would still be a point of erection rather than guidance, and qualifying things otherwise simply reflects the living measure of one who is such, but having determined it -by virtue of presuming a positive quality. It’s hard to summarize even a set of objectives based on humanity, economics, geography etc., so it is hard to fully erect -as if the right thing should be done, and that each thing doing what it is meant to do (by virtue of the natural flow of things).
    <br>&emsp;Bring this back, the limits of deduction are such that the concepts their based on may in fact be misplaced due to our limit (or prematurity rather) of understanding the objects which said concepts are based on. We may see event A causes event B, and in general form some idea of causality. And as such, an event becomes a symbol, or condition rather, which we can use to postulate a formula of outcomes that occur based on this or that element. The problem, is that less the world be whole, and considering our aim of defining the whole, it is our own error to attribute the baser concepts to the actions of ostensibly whole objects. Causality of a gun may in fact suppose that the trigger fired the bullet, but these parts are composed of smaller things, atomically if you will. And even those are further defined by the entropy and persistence of space, which to our point, behaves quite differently than our symbols profess. Conceding this point, we would not presume that our logic can in fact encompass the happenings of those finer matters.
    <br>&emsp;The second point regards the fact that our attempts to deduce, and prove otherwise, are both for the sake of understanding the truth and thus our proper actions. In other words, establishing an aim, of which wisdom is given by those who receive clarity to this. The problem, is that even if God were proven, or better said, that our deductions were correct, that applying this and suggesting how we should actually be is false. For one, testimony is quite unreliable, as even it is based on utterances which fall under ‘non-identifiable resolve’. Still, we speak of miracles to support this, and scripture to boot, but these fall flat due to the precise falsity of intervention. Perhaps it is not with an iron fist, but considering that all that there is, is almost definitively a mark of the creator, or at the least the destiny that reflects how things have so far come to be, of which suspension and or intervention is excluded. This is simply by virtue of what we have elsewhere seen, and that besides imagery and suspicion, objects can not be intruded, as by the present impression of thermodynamics and quantum theory, entirety’d explode. And in a way, since that hasn’t happened, then so too can we be sure that nothing occurred that would cause that. Again, we are supposing that the divine is real, and that all things have a plan and are guided, but suggesting that intervention -as if during the process- proclaims validy how we should be with respect to our actions, fairs very little.
    <br>&emsp;It would seem that our rationality and sensibility offer more there instead. And as a righteous defense (in this practical side of the arena) whereby someone might exclaim, ‘so what are we suppose to do then, or is there just no meaning’, we could say, ‘that just as you would identify shortness of breadth and the anticipation of the summer heat, so could you be clear on the description of your death, which upon being nothing, fairs nothing more than that most desirable thing (when it is of the purest form): sleep’.
    <br>&emsp;In short, presuming a larger plan is unnecessary in the same way that a thieve cares not if there was in fact one, for he goes where his desire takes him, to which our wisdom can seek a natural end. Although we are not required to act or be inconsistent for the sake of proving inconsistency, so to can we say that the boat should be pointed this way by the misdirection that deduction and its application otherwise seem. Nature is rising ahead, and despite the many sirens and tempests ahead, so can we be sure and confident that the ride is progressing for our enjoyment, as wherever we go (or get to) so is it the same if we now reach the end.

 <div id="lettingyouknow">
    I feel quite bold in saying this, as writing letters is not a relevant or desired thing. From time to time though, a suspicion in me arises, one which we have in a way shared over the years, but (as often happens) gets covered by more ordinary matters.
    <br>&emsp;Rather than propose something, I only wish to illustrate what’s on my mind. Imagine two scenarios. On one hand, you have a course (in life) which is professionally significant, full of excitement and fun ahead, and generally one which is broadly sociable and rewarding. In contrast, imagine a life which was more isolated, or local we’ll say. Instead of traveling and conversing as in the former, imagine this latter was one of mere privation. Fortune could allow for ventures around, but consider it a more studious and personal life to yourself.
    <br>&emsp;Obviously, the first seems preferable, as who wouldn’t want such elements in their life, or at the very least who wouldn’t want to avoid the material of the latter. I have a second aspect though. Regarding the content -or activity we’d say- of each, where then does the favor lie? I would argue that the professional one, despite having much to do -and perhaps in exotic and or adventurous ways- is much more administrative than you’d realize. Our hopes may be treated, as would we be pleased in staying at a grand hotel, but would our occupations not keep the course of our days somewhat held? And even if we could travel, would it not be for business, or at the very least would we not still have something ‘work-like’ to do throughout the trip? It’s true that we would have other opportunities to travel as we please -or do as we seek no matter- but at what point are we referring to, in that we either have surpassed our place within our career (or business) and are now set to retire? Because if it is otherwise and our role is still present, then would our trips and voyages not be but occasions, or vacations at best?
    <br>&emsp;Furthermore, considering the sort of people we’d be around, what sort of interests would that facilitate, or at least be fostered by the expected discussions? This translates then to that more homely life, whereby one’s personal study of physics, psychology, economics etc., happen (I’d say) more naturally and consistently. It’s not that being a lawyer, technician or entrepreneur bars you from such pursuits, but how level is the road in this case, or at least how much draw is there from such a light when your lenses are born from those former kinds of ambition. “It’s like a chef who familiarizes themselves with all the food and flavor in the world with the intent of sharpening their pallet for wholesome foods -so that they may taste better- and that despite their prudent intent, the care and or interest for such things is replaced by the crap they used for development.” In other words, if we are busy and ordained to a life of number crunching, management, itinerary and the public, what place will there be, or rather what interest will we have, for those personal studies? Adding to that, what about a love of film or games, or recreation of the local, yet explorative kind? What about the great things our handiness and industry want to make, or at the very least, our actual care and regard for developing and existing maturely and with strength?
    <br>&emsp;I’d introduce this most important point that has to do with children -despite its irrelevance right now- that upon their arrival, ought our goods be ready to go and serve. Better said, if such task -of rearing our children, or being part of a family no less- is in a way a test, then which kind of life affords us more than we can offer? Again, it may not seem relevant, but if we have families someday, will anything be more important? And beyond our duties, won’t it be a somewhat pleasurable demand, that we are steady and richened by said experience? Whether it is because we feel good about treating them well, or the sweet joy of our contribution and involvement, is this not -in our later years at least- the aim? Which kind of life would we have that procured this? Is it not a cliche that those in high positions have not but good intentions for their child? But who raises them, teaches, molds them, or is patient even -as you’d still assume some presence. Moreover, what sort of person would you want them to grow to be? Would it not be one who similarly found themselves, and consequently were able and set on offering as such to their families? Would you rather they be businessmen, or artists, thinkers, men?
    <br>&emsp;I am sending this to you because of a thought that I’ve had. For months it’s been trailing behind me, and I thought that by sharing it with you specifically, it would cease its weight-bearing. Effectively, I am not pursuing any business, nor am I set or drawn towards a career or profession. The content that I mentioned pulls me instead, and I am happy and pleased to proceed naturally and gradually for the sake of that. As I see it, the way that science, entertainment and (in general) the world is talked about is akin to the creativity offered by windows vista. “Every point is just stiff and stale.” It’s not the ideas that are lacking, only their depiction, or illustration rather. What I seek, is to learn and teach about these things using Windows 10. That would brighten my day, and is a light I wish to shine. If there is any gems of actual advancement, then so too is that an asset. But otherwise, I am satisfied with the presence of these things in my life, being so bright themselves. If I know it, that is fine, and if others know it then that is exciting. I need not get anywhere though, nor do I wish to pretend like I’m trying. That is what I wanted to say, that I am no longer suspending my efforts for the sake of some future start, ‘when fortune has finally given me room to do so’. Casually, this personal and active state of mind and intention has settled breezily with others around me; because I care not, I find it easy to speak about it in simple ways to co-workers (and strangers), and otherwise my parents are more than understanding. I’m just removing my adolescence, and forming myself with the real intent that I have, which as I see it, is the most worldly and enrichening when it is ripe with learning and teaching where I really care, and extending that humanity and strength to a future (and plausible) family.
    <br>&emsp;My wonderment is whether there is any real value and promise in furthering, or at the very least discussing and reveling (through these Windows 10 ways) fundamental physics, the Gods, death and our overall lives.Or how much money is worth it to never play Ark, or ultimate frisbee, to always see the compliments and attention of others over the integrity of your days? Is your own personal responsibility not filling, and occupying for that matter, and when you are so is the idea and or dream of flying, driving, appearances and dinners sincerely appealing? They are not for me. And the alternative that I am staked in is not merely an adjacent trajectory, ‘as if we went from lawyering to doctoring’. The aim is different, the course is different, the words are different. And instead of leaving off with, ‘and that difference is that I wish to and mean to progress for the sake of well-being and living, as compared to being well off’, I’ll offer a stronger quote instead. From what place and whom, no matter, only, it is (and here it goes), “I care less for books but what gives them value, those being the doctrines which fill them: as the best ones make a great book so.”

    As we once said, there is a hill atop the tree. Its claim, is the room and hand to see the lands around, and my favorite cloud above. So too, does its pleasentries make the demands around hospitable: for she is what their providing. Furthermore, is there land aorund this hill. On one end theres a grove, gentle and kind yet firm and stout, then theres a patch of woodlands scurting about, and some glades strung here and there. In some of the denser sections there are farms, where the trees are quite hollow, yet still bound. Pastures come and go, as do orchards and glens, but to each all is there trunks and canopies to be found, which makes my view from top nice and sound.
    <br>&emsp;I’ve begun to notice though that as our spot becomes secure and blossomed, so does the patch of land around thrive and glissen. The grass is greener, as our the bees making more honey. And as I see it, a bit of landscaping could make room for other members of the forest, or at least encourage those under their far off trunks, to come visit this heavenly garden. Still, the fruits are really what become our labor, and despite our growing intent and efforts to level out the field around, so does our higher makings draw our hand. Such illustrations and scripture truly define me in all that its worth. I see the sun setting, as well as the moon coming behind, and the pleasing sight of birds chirping around, makes not but the abscence of bombs and mowing a breeze. This tree of mine is all I have, and for no reason other, that we have become bare from our low needs, does its own grasp and wonder, give me all I seek.
    <br>&emsp;And so I am fine to resist the urge to join a farm, or to forgo the anticpation of starting something similar; were not going out there, we’re growing right here. To one side, we have the furthering green I can offer, and our trimmings and design serve merely as invitations -of which the birds and bees are already singing. On the other hand, is our shine, the real light which pillars from below, springing out of that upper trunk into the world above; here is where our energy and time is purely spent, as if there were rock sculptures marked in the otherwise meadowy grove.

    For some time Gillen sat alone, though without any shortness of peace. His life was far from normal, but in other ways par for the deepest norms. You see, Gill was no son of man, rather he was man himself. Astute, kind, wicked and rational. Never set to anything but himself, he smiled as he bowed to those around, and elected to endure without any semblance of duty. “As one who eats chocolate fears not or asks not why such thing is so enticing, so too did Gillen advance and contain a ready woe of cheer and respect for others and himself.”
    <br>&emsp;Now, such sweetness was not of a kind that others find in more common matters; rather, he simply found it satiable, like a warm afternoon. Hereby, his many interests and ventures were set not to feed his impulse or loins, but his character instead. In fact, as he’d say, it was the regularity of contentment and experience which he sought, and nothing more than those necessary things -or those which were deemed applicable- bent in any desired way.
    <br>&emsp;Gillen was raised to be a man, but grew up resenting the fact that his tasks (and according disposition) were really that of a boy. He knew so much about little, yet of alot he grew no lasting end. Even in his later years where more genuine pursuits sparked his mind, so too did he still resemble one ployed by a thoughtless end. As it were, he accepted the terms given to him, ‘even though the advice given and satisfaction by others on hand, did not match the apparent flatness to the cake(so to speak)’. From the start of 10 he began to ignore such recipes, finding more youth in the fresher foods (and fruits) instead. But when he entered youth a call for arms in kitchenhood was demanded, and despite his tender pallet, he had no skill and thus means of placement.
    <br>&emsp;The key difference of Gillen though was that he did not permit the tradition, even upon his own apparent lacking. Instead, he fostered his own recipes, leaning towards areas which were simple and effective. And even though for many years into his adolescence he had no home beyond the borders of defeat, he was happy. Despite his lack of suiters and good, his pallet and mind commendably and sincerely enjoyed even the minorest of things. Consequently, he sought not for anything more than to be so freshly satiated, and secure by his consistence.
    <br>&emsp;Time would go on though and the bareness of this line -however ample and pleasing- whithered away his core content. That trait though -or principle as it became through deliberation- of pure aims of goodness, rung him forward into an even heartier version of his centered self. Whereas before he was happy with nothing, so he gave that some extension. Effectively, Gillen enjoyed the fruits of his rightful life, as the relief and vanity of those otherwise traditions brought him nothing but ignorant pleasure or shame. Born from his frugal credulity, he relished great people and literature, the orbit of high entertinatmet around gaming and film, or the base act of traveling the lands outside his door. “Urban walks he’d call them, and treks.” By our mentioned though, these goods ran in conflict with the needs of the world. As we said, Gillen began to falter a little in how insubstantial his life had become. Even though those goods were plentiful and pure, their place began to shorten under his shrinking home.
    <br>&emsp;Better said, the world remained demanding of him, whereby his response was to be frugal; and as such, his response was only small, but sufficient. Unfortunately, this did not give any room for those genuine pleasures, and the still present need of duty (however small) persisted in rubbing against such preferred efforts. But, that amendment to goodness availed, as this squeezing of ease and peace into a small bottle drove an expansion of its bounds. The story goes that Gillen gave those interests of his more definition, and as he called it, ‘an objective aim’. In doing so these actions of his sincere kind, solidified as the fruits of his being, but also as the reasons for being elsewhere obliged. The minor tasks at hand were then given more justification for partaking in, making the smaller life more acceptable; and better yet, more rewarding, as the comparably simple things (yet of a robustness which reflected the root of his heart) furnished his time and care around, widening his experience to a favorable effect. Before, his time was spent being punctual and prudent, whereas now his labors were serving his cultivation and interest of writing and art. Moreso, the attention which he gave to those efforts, quickly turned itself to the actual work at hand (of provision that is). And by that, those toils became not so, and more utilized too. By his own remarks, “It was easy to show up from time to time for the little I needed, for the whole lot that I had.”

    Reading about great men (or women) brings me to a relatable sense of cheer. Foremost, is that I see how their life emulates my own, in that we are each human. Consequently, the world around seems more hospitable and ill bravoes. What I mean to avoid is this sense that people are foolishly lauding their achievements over my head. When I read about great men however, I sit back into the view that neither are people feeling too rewarded, but they are not seeing themselves as great or better (comparatively). Moreover, is it clear that our centrality is not so unknown, and that by seeing how so and so lived their life, so too does their world around seem equally busy, but passing by: and in return of these studies, so does our world appear the same.
    <br>&emsp;Now, different folks offer different strokes, be it from their innovations or their candor, or to their solitude or creative resolve. The ancients speak to this foremost, for they not only share great insights via their writings, but you also see how level the world their part of is, for them and all around. Mathematicians and Scientists offer their own esoteric reward, whereby advancements of mechanical thinking and study are reached through ending amounts of lasting privation. Reading about Newton then or Galileo, brings me to a sensible place of the people around, as well as valuing our own committed developments. Writers and Artists too share this effect, but add a further point of industry and methods; or in other words, they speak to how great things are done, and how the life which accompanies this is truly a higher one. And better said, we can describe that better life as one which is similar in structure and layout, while flowering more into a prominent state. “As if a colorful version of the same model.”
    <br>&emsp;On top of that, it is worth remembering that this model we share is in many ways identical, as in the case for the conditions of life, as well as being simply comparable on the basis of what peace and enjoyment require, and what fairs risk for familial and personal fortune. “Most things slip easily for the serf and his king; and not but the jail of hell could invite varying pleasures from a sunset, or the briefest amount of self respect.”
    <br>&emsp;These are in short the heart of our community, for through it we see the pleasing nature of the world around, while also bringing more central firmness and strength by more strictly knowing. The modern world has its own angle though, as it is by definition that point whereby the chore is in learning how to live. Assessing Marlyn Monroe or George Lucas, bears fruits of what this requires. Better said, it is nice to hear about people in these open days, who do great things, but are still themselves ordinary. And by seeing this we can realize that such free lanes are not the harbingers of necessity for you to achieve glory and posterity. Instead, we can see that a broader approach of dense riches, fairs best in the lands where anything goes. And in a way, this modern take is one where people who are not so great and do great things, sheds off the mistake of seeing them as great, or that your ends should be equally rewarding. This liberty of ours is to live well after all, and coming from the bottom we can see that the principle best is when we are ourselves. And that instead of seeing the road ahead as an open lane for conquest, let us simply be who we are in the truest way, then further in its width through a natural gait, or gradual process rather as remarks our interests solidifying below.

    The form is quite important in anything you do. An age old question was about why you should write properly in your journaling, seeing as they were private. Well, the answer is simple. If I wish to speak about our childhood, that is our material. And that I would choose to do it in prose is more or less the style. That we would spell correctly, and insert paragraphs, reflects the form. And the reason we administer the latter is that it further helms the former. Now, expression is as expression does, and some may simply wish to fling paint at the wall; only they have merely lived in that moment, leaving very little that is recognizable behind. Whereas in our private writings, we can formulate them well enough that the work done bears more lasting significance, which in fact (as I’ve found) purports further additions, or adjustments at least.
    <br>&emsp;Another example is that if you enjoy the sunset, you may wish to inscribe your view of it beyond the outer feelings of it being bright and warm. Instead, you may earn more and feel higher by constructing your view of it with more shape, grades of hue and vibrance, context of what’s around; and as a consequence, a simple regard -be it in words or illustration- may instill the care you have for the subject, and motivate you to expand your sight of it, in more elusive ways in many cases. In that, we learn to study the sun and its way, or make further reflections of our previous views, or at least further describe the current ones we have; moreso, might we relate ourselves and the other elements of our lives, both in terms of how this subject compares to those, and how this as a particular element speaks to the mold by which it and those others follow. “Being more attentive to the operation by which you express yourself, furthers the well of values you have, as well as their members.”
    <br>&emsp;For me personally then, increasingly being myself needs specific regards for particular pieces of the form, as well as the way the mediums relate. Moreso, could we differentiate what is preferable for each, and that which marks our love. “For on Twitter we are asked to compose threads, order them and head the lot with a table of contents, but our work that fills the margins is built and delivered from another hand -of our heart let’s say.” In that way, we can generalize and say that the goal of our lives is to forever and further be ourselves; and if doing so amounts to bringing your mind and care to fruition, then the deliberation and design that reflects this suggests a large and expanding path; and as such, deserves (and in many ways demands) our steps be towards an advance that respects the frame of this lane. And if such bearing is more akin to war and travel as compared to a battle or (brief) excursion, then we can comfortably say that we are prior to the thrusts of such expressive experience.
    <br>&emsp;In being pre-mature, yet rightly at the beginnings of a true line, we can address ourselves now as proceeding from the start of our lives. This isn’t to say that we aren’t already moving, only that our consistency need oblige the frame in which the term is set -that being forever, and increasing to. By that token, ought our battlements and strategy respect the fact that we are in the early stages of matured production, and with reference to what we explained before (regarding forms and substance), we can for now just focus on material, while we otherwise study and prepare how they will be administered -or baked rather. Those are conditional regards though, meaning that they act as a standard that can be met and surpassed. While our interest in literature for example, marks the coals and embers of being me, and thus will remain.

By that token, ought our battlements and strategy respect the fact that we are in the early stages of matured production, and with reference to what we explained before (regarding forms and substance), we can for now just focus on material, while we otherwise study and prepare how they will be administered -or baked rather. Those are conditional regards though, meaning that they act as a standard that can be met and surpassed. While our interest in literature for example, marks the coals and embers of being me, and thus will remain.

    I had this novel idea that the reason we socialize is that it gives us the room to express ourselves in a larger way, and that this is by virtue of our instruments being otherwise alarmed at the presence of others who seem unfriendly. A private congregation speaks to this, in that they both feel condemned and ill expressed outside their group. On their own however, they seem hollow, or at the very least seem unformidable beyond the group assurance within.
    <br>&emsp;All ends are for peace, as this means you are doing things well, in both your response and vision. Now, wisdom and character reveal the world in what it truly is; and primarily, reflects our deaths and baser needs, while also tempering riled up ones that come from our ignorance of this.
    <br>&emsp;Are we not free then? What are we defending against, besides our honest reflections? I am not sure. Partially, it is because the world’s opened up and overwhelms us with intrusive impressions. The statement of this is important. If we were not distressed, then we would be free, and act within an according spirit. Were always poked though, and moreover do we childishly ignore the fact that our impressions are ill founded. “It’s as if the teachers in school reference the fact that the world is as the news says, and then alludes to us as though we are trying to figure things out amidst it. Their teachers for gosh sake, yet it seems like they’re just making conversation. Only their image is more complete yet less founded, whereas ours is smaller, but in a way sprouting towards the same ignorance.”
    <br>&emsp;And when we think the world is here -by the view born from all those blurbs coming together to press upon us- we prescribe ourselves to its medium. This leads to avarice, whereby we ignore people’s personal agency, and assume otherwise that a water hole will attract a bunch; piracy too comes up as we then scurry over opportune gains.
    <br>&emsp;There’s just so much hustle and bustle, and I am convinced that it is from a culture that imitates the more rooted lineage, which is born from the grand average of people giving things very little thought. In Christian times, you could sensibly revere the will of Christ. Moreso was there an end clearly laid. In modern times still there is nothing but death, yet we still act as though things are required by which our amendment to what’s trending and laborous is demanded. No one has ever been exempt from living frugally, nor being considerate.
    <br>&emsp;The heart of the wound is in sight. A bully in school, or kids who are mean make fun of others, who then respond with submission, either in passive preservation, or bulking up. These kids though hear it from their parents, who hear from the news, who as an aggregator relies on the grouping of particular segments into the whole.
    <br>&emsp;What is happening is that people are afraid. Principally, I think this is so by virtue of your place if you are out of agreement. The explanation could go as follows then. Everyone is subject to the lands around. And as it is, we’re all foolishly in agreement about the state of our culture and the world. However, and the point, is that being more clear and sensible brings you out of that line. Because if you say that there is no grave presence of racism, or that a career is futile, or that children should be properly raised, to those who otherwise ignore this or have elsewhere been filled with hot air, these rational remarks come across as either impositions or unrealistic. “Wake up Ryan, haven’t you seen the news, the worlds gone to hell.” It’s as if they cant hear anything past the register of their immediate response.
    <br>&emsp;This is all a simple compound effect. Not in severity mind you, only in substance. Where the truth lies though is in the everyday nature and course of our lives. And the strands of the world reported on are dirty and red, but they don’t in fact spread across the entire garment, where those primary concerns are held -and thus acted upon. That is why being frugal and free, rational, reserved and cheerful is uninteresting to people, or even offensive. For in their mind the troubles are larger, political, international, prepping for hate, and acting otherwise runs contrary to such threats, or at the very least addresses them poorly. “How do you have time for fun and respect, there’s a battle going on!”
    <br>&emsp;You might say the crux of this is how people respond to danger compared to those who are at peace, and how we are hindered by falsities of the former, and failing to cultivate the necessary fruits and more prominent gains of the latter. And in terms of us, the question then is who we should be if we fall towards that proper end.

    For some reason the world feels afar, and partially this is from our lack of place locally. But a larger issue has accrued, and that is the fact that our gradual debts of viewing things improperly, have shackled their inappropriate conclusions as if they were true. Now, all seems to be going on around, and even if we are in a stable state, so to do we peer out the door; better yet do we announce the merit of our efforts and their readiness to be placed outside.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, we are premature. And as it happens we are not in a retreat away from those who would otherwise pass judgment. And although that course has left us with holes, or preconceptions at least, so too have we advanced beyond any downward trajectory. This has come from sharing our interests and creations, and alluding to either their promise or continuation in the days ahead. Consequently, our aspirations are in no holding order, ‘as if we are being asked when they will be gotten around to’. Still, that knife hovers lightly overhead, however blunted.
    <br>&emsp;The truth, is that those dreams and ambitions have grown right inside of me, and our adventurous course of grandeur and notoriety feels somewhat necessary and appealing. Reflecting on the world as it really is though -or on the contrary I mean- and identifying the elements which truly are important to me, tidies me up and keeps me tender and light, whereby foolish promises or perceived expectations slide on by. In a word, people’s enthusiasm over me doing something rubs me the wrong way, as their suggestion is that such course would be good, whereby I lose myself in fear and doubt over the shortened end I otherwise seek. But, it is that underdeveloped truth which holds little aim or regard, and makes such comments penetrating, as if I were being either criticized or pitied -morose do I feel small, like the latter.
    <br>&emsp;The question then is one of honesty, as we naturally will do what we are right to. And even though reflection and deliberation are required, so too does our firm state bring this out pleasingly, and effortlessly. And accordingly, do our efforts follow; or at the very least, will our ingrained nature to be doing something, heed the light which we have placed ahead. None see this as contrary, but they do want me to be doing. And such worthwhile ends are not so simple to acquire when our writing hands or reading eyes are dull. And so, we spend time just trying to live, worried that our apparent non-forwardness will draw concern. The grounds have solidified though and the limit is really in me. As it were, their recommendations aren’t wrong, and in turn of what is obvious in what could further me more, we can still try it. At least advancing ourselves through that can be aspiring enough, that we can at least share that we attempted, then explain that its end or task ran contrary to where I was set upon. And if it is desirable through your heart and bone, then go for it. But resting on the common fact that all ends are equal, and that nothing from the fruit of our yearning loins comes easy, strictly warrants any obvious query. For we are not in that way going out of our own. And we can at least say that we tried, reassuringly, and proceed if the ease is in fact more present, or happily stay for the sake of our own private matters. “The struggle comes from a consequent place that frazzles us over proceeding besides this, and otherwise settling in because the core of it lacks reinforcement -by clarity mind you as opposed to proof and scrutiny.”

 <div id="adearclaim">
    The world could surely just end, or otherwise change into something which it hasn’t been. What is identifiable may not be known, but it is safe to say that what is relevant is that which is identifiable. We may in fact be limited in our ability to do so, but that should merely humble us, or if we at the very least haven’t used our tools of perfection on everything, then so too should we accordingly proceed. I say this with the utmost confidence, for just as I realize that I need food to eat and air to breath, or the simple (yet deeper) reflection that rest is more desirable than moments of fun (and lack of following rest), so too can I see that our death is merely peaceful. Nothing except the broadest of concepts could tell me how my soul would be following death, and testimony fairs little here -as it ultimately counts on what we can identify- and seeing as there are no contrary elements that suggest our lack of being would not in fact be just that (lacking), leads me to believe this is true, and accordingly oblige to it by virtue of there being (necessarily) an amendment. “For all wisdom points to a path, truth being the measure for which way is best to go; but in all ends, or routes that is, having one is the crucial given. For we may otherwise be undecided and fretful, which brings no lasting claim.”
    <br>&emsp;Adding to that, I can say that in writing this, and by taking refuge in what’s identifiable -and thus negating all things which run contrary to what could occur based on what has been identified- I see that this definite end is not a poor one. As it were, in my own strides of life, I sleep; moreover, do I upon series of actions rest. And in that latter especially do I find the deepest satisfaction and state, ‘as my body feels out of itself when it remains a servant to further action, as if the prior one’s completed were not sufficient’. Rest just feels good, as it reflects work done well. And in any case, again with the notion that nothing is the predicament, fears me not, as on one end there is no subjection to fear and scrutiny, while the other side sees such a time as (consequently, and inherently) peaceful. Perhaps the Buddhist notion of one’s struggle coming from ignorance, affords me (or at least has) the freedom to see such time as splendid, as upon my own awareness and self regard, has living truly been claimed, and thus given rest its reputable position. “As I say, my body needs action, both in terms of obligation, but also in terms of the ‘itching’ that comes from that disposition -in the case where such priors were fulfilled, yet I sought to continue.” And in that case, my mind and spirit settle nicely, either in a purely resting state -whereby ‘nothing’ (akin to the activity of meditation) is done- or through simpler and tender moments -wherein the centered states of my mind and body settle into lighter things, in an equal fashion.
    <br>&emsp;Ignorance has removed this, for just as I can identify that death is our gain -and its identifiable nature- so too can I and have, recognized the particular motions, or states rather, which I’d qualify as either positive or negative. In other words, by giving my self a great deal of lasting thought and care, I have seen what is preferable, reflected on and deliberated their cause, then forwardly assessed and considered -almost by virtue of my ease- to such a tranquil end. “It’s as if in our orderly and centered state, a natural and destined end of pure nothingness, seems pleasing, and otherwise explicitly graspable by being rational (or principled rather).”
 </div>

 <div id="thefullestway">
    It is believed more or less that demonstrating yourself in the fullest way is the right way to be. And to any prompt as ‘what about the world’, this we’ll say covers it. “For in being myself I bring the most; moreover, we could say that the end of all things about the land, is that those present could be themselves too.”
    <br>&emsp;By that token, I call on the premise of progress, that is if developments are said to be made, then the end in which they seek will come about too -the common example being health brought on by the exercises that you do, and as the latter improves than so too should the former, otherwise the mean is off.
    <br>&emsp;Furthermore, we can say what being ourselves amounts to. As a common mold, our death brings us a limit, where we would otherwise reach who we are in the fullest and remain. As there is an end in accordance with the limits of tissue, then so too will our active time as our fullest selves wain. “For even if the mold remains, our use of it will not; this is the case ultimately, but also as we approach that point -so a lessening will also occur alongside the final end.” In any case, the point is that in being ourselves in the truest way, will that time wain, whereby we are (more or less) set to retire. “As if the water is calming, despite being pure.”
    <br>&emsp;Now, actions prior to this will be explicitly incomplete, seeing as they come from a less than ideal instrument. The crucial point is that just as one in their beginning years progresses to a point of even standards, so too will the person at that competent stage work from a place of initial goodness -or well placed steps- to great ones. At least, that our steps from a complete base will be relatively lesser than those which follow is what were trying to say. Only, just as a chef with a blunt knife cuts better after subsequent tries, even a sharp knife will see better cuts ahead, although the early ones are still alright.
    <br>&emsp;In other words, the path to greatness, or the realization of our truest self, begins when the right steps are taken: and these are definitively true, and correspondingly rewarding. It’s just the case that as more are taken, will the goodness flower and blossom. “Whereas the time and effort before this stage, however abundant and set, fairs substance of a lesser measure -or quality that is.” For the sake of argument then, we’ll clarify that many subpar steps are lesser than the early days of ones well founded. A simple explanation is that only so many steps are taken in each case, per interval that is; so we aren’t talking about one hundred 9/10s compared to four 10s, rather a couple of bullseyes over a few more slight shorts, sees the former as stronger.
    <br>&emsp;Another element of this then, is how those founded steps proceed. Simply, we can define the range of it by those prior definitions, that upon maturing, or fully fitting into our shoes that is, can we take proper steps, and that the trajectory from there takes you from, as they say, a young adult to a full one -whereupon you retire. In other words, our end, actively that is, or of our self regard, is in taking our greatest step. And just as we addressed death as a common issue, so too will we bring up the occurrence of relationships and children. That is due to these segments of our lives being the most important, more or less. If you are a champion, a tyrant, a saint or even a god, it is usually your connection to those around which best describes the blossoming success of your day. “That is, if you were well, it was in the midst of that, rather than being without, yet somehow fully set within the presence of accolades and coin.”
    <br>&emsp;Again, we are trying to take the strongest step; and if we consider how relations effectively amount to separate agencies (or members) coming together (to relate), then we can most definitely say that such bond is purest and true when the parties involved are whole themselves. “Two great thieves form a band of deceipt, but at least a full one, compared to two bumbling fools who barely join to make a half, or two amateur saints otherwise.”
    <br>&emsp;That being said, we can illustrate this further by distinguishing between relations you have, or get rather, and those that you give. As a sunset is gracious, as we are hospitable and respectful, so too would a partner or friend earn your love and accord. But in comparison to the other obvious aspect of children, we could say that the clear difference between the two is that one emphasizes what you get, in comradery and intimacy let’s say, while the other banks itself moreso towards what you give. To be clear neither are exclusively the other, but to my friend Bob who lends an ear, despite how much of mine I give to him, so too to my son Bobby, will the loan be better: and moreso will I ask for less, as in this case my place is of a role foremost, compared to the latter which roots itself in mutual benefit. “And such an exchange is lacking, in weight that is, when it comes to me and my child -as I only seek to give while charging little.”
    <br>&emsp;In effect then, besides the particular needs by each kind of relation, we can forwardly say that where the best one is in place, is where we are appropriately the best member ourselves. “At the very least we can say that our duty and limit of inclusion, is in being a full half.” Based on the law of attraction though, or at least how these sort of bonds form, becoming yourself prior seems necessary. That is, upon maturing and filling out from there, can people suited to respond to that fall in line. Whereas if we are immature, then the relations we have will be necessarily incomplete, both by virtue of us not bringing who we fully are to the table, as well as those others who, if being complete (so to speak) themselves, will not be pairing with one who is truly set for them. “Ill founded steps sees everyone lose: which is why being ourselves in the truest way bonds us properly with the world, and in turn we gain.” And more or less, the sentiment of what’s appropriate follows with children, whereby the need they have to be nourished and raised, will only be so fully if what you have to offer is equally so.
 </div>
 <div id="apropercourse">
    The two sides of our life, at least in regards to what were concerned with, is the leveled truth of our course, and our otherwise resolve to treat it. Simply, the former is capped by our coming death, as are the stakes of others; too, we are a prince of such fortunes, for when my Dad passes away (and my mom too), we will inherit their wealth. “As I have done so mentally through the spoils of Descartes and Socrates.”
    <br>&emsp;A midpoint reflects our ambition, and how life will generally remain local and tame, and if it otherwise springs up into more adventure and fun, then the requirements to do so will themselves remain, while also being the prominent feature of our lives. “Which is why they say you never work a day if you do what you love, for those on business live very little.”
    <br>&emsp;In terms of our resolve it amounts to three things. On the front end is said business, which is to say something which is manufactured for the public eye; personally, though I prefer to angle this sight through the lens of operation, whereby we simply adhere and respect that such efforts are only relevant, of interest or rewarding if we are constant and substantial. On the other end sits our local affairs, whereby excitement and returns are given little regard, and we instead lay each brick for the sake of our joy and rest. This is not a route for fortune while were in it, and although it springs fruits for that former application, our mind is merely advancing through what it can bring right now; whereas that prior side looks to expand itself by virtue of these efforts, and afterward rest in the room on hand, our enriched life of presence and immediacy merely looks to contribute in ways that it is pleasing now. The former side looks for solidarity, learning and teaching through community, while seeing more ahead with pride and confidence; though it must also fend with the weights of a slow pace. This personal side seeks to be with the world immediately, or at least go right to the end by which those fortuned offerings would provide. Here, we are home through ourselves, and with friends and family by virtue of humanity. We are saturated by history and science, while giving our own time and color to the writings of others, or the bare beauty of great games and film. This lane of ours is always on the edge of expanding infinitely wide, yet strictly sharpened -and thus short in the point in front- or is otherwise brought back to a place where nothing is cared for but our return, either in fortune or of that known grip.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, this is our primary life, as we are with ourselves regardless. Breathing though is hard, as is being on your own with stillness; and so venturing forth to find more lands or significance bears nothing sparse, but is a venture no less. And whereas the trek of our local hearts is in our craft and ability to paint with the minor strands of our soul, so too is that outer pursuit one of industry and might, wherein the grandeur which appears on offer is appealing. For each though, it is our advance, through ourselves or towards such might; for either, no end is but ours truly in sight.
    <br>&emsp;And quickly, there is a halfway between the two which we call direct initiative, whereby we apply ourselves intuitively and sensibly in ways that our natural arrangments have; submitting our essays is a primary example as is taking co-opeative (or at least involved) classes or workshops. These are not meant to bring you through the world, but merely extend who you are on your own. And as they say, friendship is found between those of similar care and interest, and so being yourself around others can afford such opportunity to see and attract: only though, so that you are more at home.

 <div id="constantbend">
    I fear not to fail in this description, but the subject offers most with any definition. Simply, as our condition is present, so is a humble response of dear fertility. Practically, the reasoning for our post is one thing, but the attention onto its treatment by us, is comparable to a deference to drunkenness, ‘whose bleeding eyes leave nothing pretty to remark upon’. As one may become averse to that, so would the crumbiness of our obligations spark a similar response.
    <br>&emsp;Now, the distinction is not that the cause of these effects would be shoved aside, for they are our condition. Instead, ought we treat them like athletics, whereby our failure to warmup and its consequent effect of stiffness, would not be a fault of the game but your oblige. So too with work and other roles, that if your arguing with your family, it is not their fault, nor the world’s malice for setting you upon such despair, but your own failure to listen.
    <br>&emsp;There is to be clear an element to this which remedies and dissipates the weight and or sharpness of these points of demand, but these are more like elevations by virtue of your own higher point, wherein the range of your front and back increases. In that way, your alignment to the effects of your role condition you well if your response is born of non bitterness and despair. That is, if your job has you bundled in shades, then stretch, or be more centered on the reasoning for doing it as to draw its purpose out; for if you otherwise complain and pout about it’s sorrowful declaration, then so will you remain and fail to profitably amend.
    <br>&emsp;This is why the main question is to whether or not we should respect or defer our response. If it were the ramblings of men or the shrillness from being drunk, then our actions could be directed elsewhere. But if it is our basic oblige to seed food and bed, then regardless of the instance which procures this, so is the demand embedded.
    <br>&emsp;The vector for this inquiry then is how and why such a scenario should be treated through an obvious way? One evident fact is that within a given condition, amending to it fairs more that shrugging it off. And so we may wish to and own the belief that our civil struggles can be removed, but to our death and common lives, will the presence of ignorance there sprout comparable burdens. Moreover, we must remember that even if all duties were in retreat, that a deep breath and or the absence of gluttonies effect would still persist. By that token, our free time may be dreamt of as that which holds us behind no bars, but only in that is the dragging weight removed, while the scrumptious joy of our heartful expression stays flat -by this point at least. That front end seems to remain as long as we have bodies, for rest is otherwise acquired, while the risk of idleness lingers. In that, a condition seems constant, ‘for in the meagerest of ways, we attribute frailty to a whithering king, or even the God of boredom’.
    <br>&emsp;What we can take from this, with the whole of things in mind -for even thieves garner an initial reward- is that a need to deliberate and reflect will persist, be it in times of war or those of freedom. The basis of this discussion then, is that a retreat from the former does not bring you away from a similar response required in the latter, only that in this latter the task is to express your liberality -as opposed to bracing yourself against the deeds of that other’s harshness. And I would say that regardless of which circumstance were in, that our amendment is still required. You could imagine that the absence of war is preferable to those lands of idle freedom, but neither is exempt from a response: the one being of clear necessity, and the other as to remove the whithering implosion.
    <br>&emsp;Through this case, we ought to avoid dreaming of a time outside the war that would cease all requests from us: for this wish is false. We may wish for the simple removal of the chains around us, but the limit of yearning then comes into play, ‘for where will action then go, to which our ignorance of that seems ill founded’.
    <br>&emsp;At any rate, the presence of duty has spurred a proper response in me, to which the weight of it has been increasingly leveled, and provisional to our gracious freedom and our broader action. That this form of amendment is strong has been established -as pittering around the presence of misfortune and deeds is in contrast to virtue. But I can say with a reputable honesty, is that this line of progress doesn’t merely turn off the beaten path and onto an even road, but continues by the sentiment of freedom’s requirements -and those lingering baser commands. What prevails then, is that vicious notion, as if our ingenuity ought be applied to removing the condition, or finding ways to add more torque to the rope. Of avarice this is poor, but in demonstrating creativity it is not, but losing sight of your path on the whole reflects a scurrying restlessness, as opposed to more hand crafted re-alignments -and even longer lasting alterations of our bearing.
    <br>&emsp;To reiterate, the heart of this discussion stems from that greediest of questions regarding the control of our fortune. As it were, the place of one accordingly but in the nearest of spaces (by those torments) has not much else to go on; for in a way their head is so covered, and likely by their own action, that nothing good or of reason has previously developed. “And so the dreams of removing these grievances is understandable.” In our case though, the ground has begun to tilt downwards, and our pull from the shine beyond slowly increases. Admittedly there is no regard for what happens or what were missing as this process goes on, yet right behind me is a point where such curiosity was spent for the sake of fortune’s credit. The design of this is important, but I think I can firmly conclude, that all the peeking and or wonderment of what could otherwise be -and in many cases, considering the goods I’d generated, where it would be advantageous and pleasing to go- simply sprouts from our own weeds of which those far below have but more of the kind. Even those saints who are ignorant of death and subject to the woes of it, earn little perfection in their warranted respect, ‘for a fool otherwise who is treated inhumanely, still forgoes the identical asset of the wholest of regards’. “Which in many ways exposes one to even the minorest of threats, and gives them no personal defense against things of a comparably higher significance.” Thus, such people are not exempt from their ignorance, that is their receipt of credit. For in our case, so is an absence of death’s regard, or that of our family, or our life in general and the persisting need to water it well, affords me no principle difference in being weighed down in the samest of ways. Those in war or those drenched in poverty, do have more weight on their shoulders, but so for us as for them is it not the mark of damage being done, but the suiter being dealt to, the man, who (to my point) be it under grievous subjection, or the mere awareness of a strand of ours whithering away, earns no acclaim or repose to such troubles, ‘without cultivating knowledge and formative regard’.
    <div class="qu">To which not even the horrors of misery can offend. “For death has no greetings for those outside her door.” Bring me to that then</div>

 <div id="pathofcheer">
    So considering aims, tradition has its stake. There’s a root of thoughtlessness though, as it pays little attention to how we’ll actually live. At any rate, we could define the elements of our aim.
    <br>&emsp;First things first, is a child. Here, I simply wish to raise them well, and so that they could do the same. Partner wise, it would be odd if they were in contrast to myself; they need not avoid a bed, but if their aims were outside of how we actually spend our time, then the costs accounted for that are in fact outside of any relations happening. As far as I am aware, our all could be given now (alongside another), and our smaller living would be fine. To be clear, parks and technology furnish us the most, while dining rooms are explicitly unnecessary, as is a living room further than a bed. More than that, there is little social availability that is common outside school. And I won’t belittle them, but I support nothing about the current educational (and its logistic) paradigm.

Generationally, it is books and culture which translate your impact. “Less War and Peace carried less than Tolstoy’s children.” So the duty is sparse. Regarding our fulfillment, it is no good place to own a home and have a mortgage, but fail to make the payments and eventually lose the house. For one, it did not offer anything more when it came to living. Its fortune may give room elsewhere, but for the most part it is not effectively so. Having children is no different, that unless you are willing and able to raise them well, then there is no cause. This means that a social setting (and no infraction to demands) is in place beyond the current school system, for one. And two, that if you are able then you are willing and set for that to be your course. Again, this is not something you just get to do, for it is neither a two nor a responsibility. It is for us to be generous and live, yet our occupation with it must be right rather than novel. Foolish choices then are not acceptable, nor is the refinement until that fulfillment short of things you can personally do. Better yet, with the assumption that you would have a kid with another, would that in its own right account for something to give. And if it lasted, perhaps we could say it is duly so if the family ahead was pursued with the shared notion of what that was properly for.
    <br>&emsp;And to me, these are the boundless fruits of our blossoming.

    So considering aims, tradition has its stake. There’s a root of thoughtlessness though, as it pays little attention to how we’ll actually live. At any rate, we could define the elements of our aim.
    <br>&emsp;First things first, is a child. Here, I simply wish to raise them well, and so that they could do the same. Partner wise, it would be odd if they were in contrast to myself; they need not avoid a bed, but if their aims were outside of how we actually spend our time, then the costs accounted for that are in fact outside of any relations happening. As far as I am aware, our all could be given now (alongside another), and our smaller living would be fine. To be clear, parks and technology furnish us the most, while dining rooms are explicitly unnecessary, as is a living room further than a bed. More than that, there is little social availability that is common outside school. And I won’t belittle them, but I support nothing about the current educational (and its logistic) paradigm. I recognize though that it fills a necessary hole, that being teaching and comradery, but its execution feels either negative or average. I don’t mind though resting our choice as if that were a condition, equal to our own demands of bringing generosity forth.

 <div id="lifeofintellect">
    A life of intellect is simply one which grows from actions of the purest kind. This isn’t to say they are constantly well ordered, or mannered mind you, but rather that the vector for development is one of the dearest sort: of which man’s is his intellect. In practice, this means that our words and ideas paint the world; or better said, that those which do, for we are all intelligent as it is, are the greatest they can be. One must regard though that this path is merely one of the ripest substance, as opposed to being beyond any other kinds within the class of paths. Again, our reach is through intelligence, but so musn’t we overestimate the worth in that when compared to other paths; for if a saw were the agent in mind, then so would a course which granted the highest activity of that be one of greatness; and rather than supposing that our intelligent nature holds expressions which are superior than those of a carpenters tool, let us sprout from the way our particular operation is conducted. Better said, we may hold our sort of path as one of increased diligence; but these roots are at most complex grooves in which we are meant to fit. For it is true by nature’s causes, that our composition and award of intelligence is merely grander and deliberate, but not more significant: or rather, it, as a form, is equally so as all others, and thus deserves as fair treatment as the rest.
    <br>&emsp;At any rate, our use of intelligence will sprout fruits which reflect our dearest activity; and such counts are of the utmost when compared to the nature and expressions of all other things: but we are only the more rewarded for being so. This is in contrast to being somewhat unintelligent, or imperfect rather, but presuming that our approach to being so is not just towards a complete use and accordingly higher reward, but one where the action itself is higher than we know, as if it were marked by some beacon of divine messaging and promise. Our natural way though, in which all objects are definitively signed, sees our rational use as nothing more than a more complicated expression than that of a rock’s stillness; only in that case, the perfection of it yields minor rewards, whereas we earn the sights and creativity of the entire world (while being fully intelligent)
    <br>&emsp;Culture in a way brings us beyond the mere presence of friends and comfort, for our path beyond primitive freedom is one of that intelligence. That is, instead of mending to nature for the sake of preservation, we build up to it, in that the former is aimed at securing the space around you, while the latter brings you (through intelligent expression) onto the world around. In a practical sense, our dextrous industry once held the means to gather material and provisions, while in this point where our norms have soldified past the concerns for survival, those working hands can tribute the stars.
    <br>&emsp;What is strange though is that the more intelligent you get -that is, where that tribute is concerned- the less prevalent we are in the areas of security and comfort. Now, its not as if people are in danger or real struggle, but we do work alot, with ignorance mind you that it is indeed for things past true provision. But in either case, we are either huddled around the fire with relief from perishing, or were roasting winnies and babbling about as we go between shifts at work. Each is tributing the work though, or our provision rather: while that life of intelligence marks an experience which expands past a state of struggle or concern.
    <br>&emsp;Historically though, we are not in a place where that recognition (and according resolve) that we are in fact safe and free to tribute, is common, or sincere at least. And I find that as we come about in this fashion, that a mission comes about, whereby we revere the fact that we are set and stable, but in need of some guiding post to keep us accountable beyond the basic needs of survival. That is, instead of actually being free and tributing the world as you can, we turn our attention from survival towards rewards of a grander kind. The problem though, is that these stakes are merely set so that we can receive the fruits of a life lived well; but for one, their views on the reality of things is poor, and otherwise rooted in the fact that upon being secure, we may not know what to do.
    <br>&emsp;This is the liberal struggle. For without disposition or friendship, remaining steady and on course to that generous life is full of solitude and trouble; or otherwise, if we hold such ends as a mission, or rather some point which is bigger than ourselves -by virtue of us seeing what are in fact our true norms, but from a point of being lesser- we will make gluttunous and or restless mistakes, which keep us either vain as we root ourselves into unbecoming ways, or were unsatisifed, as the sights on those truer fashions become ruffled and unaccessible.

 <div id="theamericanscholar">
    The American Scholar is the delegated intellect for the modern world. In this case, he is in contrast to those who parrot other people’s words and ideas; these, are thinking men, in that whichever thoughts have already come to pass, they express. While our Man of thinking, is one who does so himself.
    <br>&emsp;The service that one within the office of intellect holds, is to cheer, to raise and to guide. His vector is rooted in what is original, as he plows the slow, unhonored and unpaid task of observation.”For in those, he has thought, and shares.” He must relinquish display and immediacy (in fame that is), for his cataloging is both lengthy and of the unknown. As Emerson says, ‘Flamsteed and Herschel may inscribe the bounty of stars, while those of the scholarly intellect bend themselves towards the chartering of the human mind, tracking that which no man has yet thought’. Moreover, he may patiently watch for days, sometimes months, just for a few facts -adjusting old ones as he goes. In this, he must sometimes accept poverty and solitude, disdain by those ignorant and able, or the mere stammering of his speech -for he is still figuring things out, as opposed to the solidified performances of old. In a word, he must take in the shiftless aspects of his approach, whereby he bends his will to new facts, especially those which over time reveal themselves to be true in a fundamental sense, whereby even the most common of truths are in need of a remolding.
    <br>&emsp;Our age is retrospective it seems, for in a way, what is known is really that which comes from the bottom, while the drawing light in front has already been decided. That is, the experience of those of times far old, angles our own view today. And this is what we write about. Only Emerson suggests otherwise, and Thoreua in an explicit yet private sense. Not to digress, but we may concur that this happens due to a lack of societal concern for growing such ends. That is, if the light ahead which remarks the scenery of old, is either taken now in private, or is forgone as anything of interest at all, then how will there be any productive or communal end whereby the light (as it is) broadly grows? We’ve split the atom and seen the stars drifting above, yet that light, which we’ll say is a figure for purpose and aims, has not matched itself with the scales of the nature we now see. As we said, the truth in that is retrospective. But as I see it, the limit for it having a contemporary advance, is in the privation required to do so. That is what the American scholar is; someone who has a relation to the universe, a religion, ontology and epistemology which is original to themselves. Their views adhere to facts as opposed to tradition, for the latter warrants only what is in fact evident, making the custom uneccessary -for without it, so would its truth be known to those first at hand. And at any rate, where the ways of the world and ourselves are unknown, they ask and speculate, subjecting themselves to the lane of that one within the office of intellect. This person whose philosophy is of insight, does so at the expense of uncertainty and the faintness which comes from a loss of time. This self-accusation though is a mere bramble, for even though the sun can be clearly known and seen on the birth of each, so are those slender strands which only a lifetime could, required of one to see so. “And time can seem unclear and passing in such self relying and directed ways. Especially when their fashions always seem out of sort; and despite their own road to making a life of their own, so do the hostilities and contempt from others (by those educated especially) tear at their sides.”
    <br>&emsp;The way does become easier though, for the core idea here is that within life there is still something to know. We need not the conclusions of the Church and the Greeks, but inspiration and encouragement to go off and wander as they did, only in this brand new world. For in doing so against all odds, what the scholar can say is in fact ripe and wonderful, whereby the wider truth he sees merrits adoption by others, whose lives become more representative to nature and her fullest way. And as it were, that even if the cause of this is an original view from another, so is it in this case that such offer brings a stance to all which is rooted in both breadth and firmness, whereby others can stand newly (as if awoken), but then strive for themselves. “As if the trunk of life were rooted by those modernly divine, but only so all treated by it could then go and find their own branches, earning their own fruits in effect. Moreso, could they relish (or adhere at least) to the respect and care for the foundations at hand: which is to say that albeit given (and thus unoriginal initially) so can their young lives within this fuller time be one of personal treatment and regard, which is nothing short of their own.”
    <br>&emsp;This path, whether discovered or inherited, consoles the one taking its way. Whether in origin or inspired in a particular direction, were all scholars, as we are always learning; and by our own nature, are we stirdy enough to do this in the privation which it seeks, but also bright and happy to then share what we have found, whereby we breathe such thoughts into the public realm. “We are the world’s eye in that sense, for their heads are all down, while ours are lasting and up.” By that, our conclusions are not simply that of old, but of ours so far in the current time. Were adding, growing, branching out into the vast existence which science and its discoveries now deem. And again, whether we are the first, or are at some point a student, we are all reaching a point of illustriousness, whereby we paint the world as it now seems. “Our mind is colored not by what has been seen, but rather that which we are seeing. And all that such impressions pronounce, we hear and promulgate.”

    I feel solidarity brings value to my life. Farmers churn the soil, and I in turn pay them (indirectly) at a modest price. Service men stand guard, rescue me in peril and otherwise keep the streets from thoughtless action. Engineers have made fresh and hot water nearly free and accessible, the internet for all my command, insulation and space to sleep and settle, and transit, communications, efficiency in core goods etc.
    <br>&emsp;Such liberties are made available to all of us; and those things which are made and aimed for capital, are luxuries, as no one is hoarding the access to fire safety and vaccines. So, the threat of my life is beyond any reckoning, and the givens for comfort are all but too ingrained. Yet, in my stable place, I work, tending to my own post, admittedly ordinary but one no less. In a word, specialists have sacrificed their general capacities, honing their skills past the novelties of agriculutue, and setting them into metallurgy, law forming, theological and logical construction; moreso, has leisure come to be, with comedy, drama, horror, mimes, mourales, word play and dance. All at our quick and ready disposal. But, as I said, I have a role in all of this, and like most, it is of a common and basic kind, whereby the hills and land built up and around those miracles of ingenuity, call on me (and my simpler brethren) to man the toil, sweep the parkade, and otherwise be grateful that such meagerness is all thats required to access the brilliant freedoms around.
    <br>&emsp;So I am not an omnipotent man: no engineer has given me the tools to achieve that. Rather, I am a member of the world, one as I said which is built on the irons of progress, and accessed through the basic coins of community and exchange. I dream though, or yearn for something positive. For comfort and soft itineraries dont bring peace and joy in themselves, but merely remove any risk or strain in negativitie’s regards. But positivity, is something I move toward, happily, in and for itself: yet in this common place, albeit free of impurities, is not so enveloping or found, that I have any other impulse but to run -as if to break free from these midling grounds. And admittedly what I see that draws such rushing strides, is truly what I rightly seek, yet, the nature of this response reveals the problem I’m facing.
    <br>&emsp;You see, if the sun perks your mind, and your at liberty to need no guard, then the permitt to do that bears the consequent effect of you naturally heeding such attraction. For no one in peril attends to even the most pleasing of promises, for their mind and anticipation is shut from what lies comfortably ahead -but is instead pinned in the present. Without that pin, positive things will draw you, for your senses are at liberty to see and amend. Yet, the problem is in your means for action. If you were treating a threat, then your ability to do so would mark your probability of succeeding. We could summize this as both a means of effort and that of skill -where the effort is honed. In this sense, a positive stimuli needs something similar, so that when the warmer shades of life call you away, you have both the posture and gaze to meet them, taking them in. And so in the case for safety, when you know that you are now so and the threat is gone, so does that sparkle of life need its own closure -for you may at best feel a lingering interest for something of wonder and grace, yet of what you may not particularly know, nor be truly fufilled by the warmth it brings -as it may not be easy to greet it, ‘or take its hand’ as they say.
    <br>&emsp;#########To me, the cause of your irritability is in your ill composed state of action. Simply, you have not dealt with yourself enough to be capable of preparing the means to see and the concentration to engrave your findings down. And this is worth investigating whether or not your impurity is found amongst your common troubles, in that through those meddling affairs, whether you are even good enough for those. This is to be clear an awkward equation; for what comes first, the draw of goodness, the self regarded response, which solidifes your duty and ground beneath then permitts you too actively stair, or, do you see little for you are little, and in noticing the stress that even the average wares of modernity bring, you attend to yourself for the remedy of that, but in turn become upright and attuned, whereby the world is then in view. For me, this latter marks the path whereby you surpass the flatness beneath, and bend yourself to be strong and true in the worlds greeting, by you.

 <div id="marks">
    Everyone has those marks, acting like figures without definition. You hear a tune and it moves you in a way, or you read a phrase or watch a scene, and an image of your world comes to light. For me, Art is the process of capturing this; be it in Guernica or Stonehenge, there’s this draw from the world, heeding us to oblige. This response is hard to describe though. For be it in literature, gaming, film or the world, the spark is there from me -as we are drawn. But what we are in fact doing has little definition, or clarity that is. A useful example regards a dance, whereby the melody of a tune prompts us to choreograph how we are drawn to be. Perhaps, in short, the issue is that why we’d make art is unclear, or rather what its for. Simply, I suspect that it is a stride towards pure clarity, as a sheep can rest when no predators are in sight, so can man achieve something similar when he’s better addressed that recessed thought in his mind. At the base of it then, you might say that art is a reflection of certainty, and is found in all; for dolphins do something in their own fashion, whereby they playfully jump through the water. Obviously, this would not be the case if there were pressures or inclinations around; but as it is for us, so does freedom offer fainter impressions. As more clear ones generally reflect the evolution of our senses, and their effective bend towards survival, so would someone in a more liberated scenario see more, or at least be impressed by things which would otherwise not pass through the stern sight of nature’s harsher glare.
    <br>&emsp;Taking this to be true, we can highlight the obvious fact that Man experiences such a mechanic in its highest way. For just as we saw stars a millennia ago, so do we now see the abyss behind death’s door. Nor are we shortchanged of anything less than marvel and beauty; for as those in Northern Europe saw its respective sun (and built Stonehedge), or those of Egypt tributed Orion by building the Pyramids, so can I see the entirety of existence from the palm of my hand. By the power of optics I bend light, seeing how things appeared eons ago. Moreover, I hone those fibers inwardly, seeing the microbes around me, and that which I am composed of. I may not be able to articulate all that I’ve found, or be even set on the final mark: but from my studying at least, the world appears as intricate as our free’d mind could ever see, or believe.
    <br>&emsp;By those fashions, I see art as something merely useful, as would be the case for our alerting eyes, watching for predators at every snap of a twig behind. And although danger may not in fact hold all our curiositie’s regard, so are there feelings and insights unknown. At any rate then, I feel well founded in what we suppose, which is the fact that our ultimate aim of primitive intrigue, is rest; and in our modern times where entirety has delighted us as we entered that door, so do we similarly wish to mitigate those impressions, understanding them as we would of a suspicious sound behind. Equally though, our relief from a pen which signs some thought in our mind, or the dextrous dance of our creative respect for the stars and sky which appear so divine, yield us rest, in that we are clear in our impression; or, as someone builds a sculpture of war as to reflect the catharsis of letting those memories go, so can others around be imparted with similar relief.
    <br>&emsp;Worship though fairs differently, as we are not simply trying to get that tune out of our mind, or that thought on the page. Instead -and to be clear this is a bit antiquated- we see those more elaborate things around, which again, is to say that nature’s fainter mysteries pierce our condition’s thinning veil (whereby survival becomes more in our control, making us more open); and whereas art marks a response to such impressions which are relieving, or for rest that is, so is it common for others to actually take such flame and regard it deliberately, as if we were respecting the impression for what it strictly is, or seemed rather. So, whereas a hurricane may seem daunting and destructive, an artist illustrates a response in a way to deal with this; whereas others may in fact see the hurricane for something with agency, or as a result of some messenger. This is not so easy to distinguish, for me at least. But the idea of worship and superstition definitely fall in this place. Why, well that is what is hard to suppose. As we said, the veil of feeling alarmed dissipates as our resourcefulness grows; but so do we then see fainter objects around, such as the stars; or, perhaps, we notice things such as the seasonality of the world, whereby ingenuity prompts agriculture. There’s something old though, as if those ancient impressions were treated in too literal of ways. Or in other words, the impression from nature’s further ways got characterized unfoundedly. God is the worst of these perversions; for theology and the divine are in no ways wrong or poor to suspect, but that everything present isn’t already part of that plan, fairs less rightly. For the consequences have been that we attribute our own actions to what is accordingly suspected as ‘the lord’s response’; or rather, that based on our actions, he differs in whats ordained. So hurricanes are a result of sin -as compared to being a consequent result of the first cause- and other people’s misworship causes him to feel wronged -justifying genocides, or pogroms.
    <br>&emsp;Imagine, that death was always at your door. Granted, we have more knowledge that excludes those earlier positions, as such facts have made said positions fall by removing the assumptions (evidently as it’s become) that their based on. My thinking though, is that dealing with this is in the realm of art. For death, being in this case obvious, is not something that we mean to change, but rather find relief and understanding from. This however, is acquired through art, which is to say our signature on something as to make it more known. “Again, this remarks the clarity of the breaking twig.” It is possible then, that those of primitive times believed in God before they discerned his role in death. For I suspect that their view of the world expanded, and as that image became grander, so did the ‘thematic’ divinity settle into a portrait of agency and presence. And by that account, it would seem that the obvious notion of death, stood amidst those governed ways, to which our relief was not in reaching peace through passing away, but appealing to the one apparently in charge, ‘or guarding the door’. This could still be regarded as art then, for the mechanic here is in finding relief through securing a verifying response. “A signature if you will.” But just as the sun may pass us by, and for our pleasure we engrave our feelings through erecting monuments which reflect the harmony in place, so would we bend ourselves, or act at least in respect, to the one who holds entry into a preferred end upon death, and avoid the contrary place which our poor treatment seems to grant us. This is all art, in both mythical and natural regards. Our thinking is perhaps privileged then to be in touch with the latter, while the norms of the former are just not something we can describe. But, reasonably, I’d offer the notion of our sign, and that this applies in all scenarios, and that the reason people act as they did with respect to religion, was due to it being the only game in town. “And frightened people are hard to be sensible around; for if you are the latter, acting in line with natural cases, then so will those former see this contrary to what is required to respond to the divine; and partially, even if one has served dad well, so do other’s mistakes make him mad, the anger of which frightens those who have in fact done well. For in turbulent seas, not even those with secure rafts are safe.”
    <br>&emsp;Practically speaking then, the response of any being is circumstantial; for if it is before the ancients, then you may still be at a glaring stage, where the stars simply fill you with awe; or you may be in those times of antiquity, whereby rules and understanding were made of such shine; only, as it has become known, that such portion of nature’s glare did not tell all, and that the affairs of numerology, demagogy, astrology, and salvation, were ill respective to what nature’s ways really are. History is worth looking on, for we can see insights of things which still remain. And otherwise, it can help fill out the mold of what appears right for us to do right now -in our modern ways. Which is to say, that the relief we sought then is what we seek now; only the stimuli were different then, and in most ways unrepresentative to reality. Still, even now we are not so clear on that latter; but how nature appears and our present regard to conceive it, is no different than those before, and is in many ways fortuned to be based on a modern gaze.
    <br>&emsp;Art then is lasting, and its two main components being accuracy and prompt. The former, to reiterate, reflects appearances; that is, if a sparse yet bright light shines ahead, is it in fact a divine being, or a glob of fissionable hydrogen? The latter appears more true, thus making our treatment of that well founded, in comparison at least to thinking it has a mind, and finding relief (through art) of that. Secondly though, regards the prompt. For one, we can use the twig example, and say that the relief sought here is based on safety, for if our suspicions are correct, there is in fact danger. It may not be, but we are at least curious through an understandable guard. When we were younger though and those stars first appeared, I suspect that they were not initially turned into governing gods -or at least the inspiration for so wasn’t there. In this way, such as those who built Stonehenge, the treatment, or relief rather of this unclear feeling, was that which remarked our awe, or wonder that is. These are quite privileged experiences to respect, as although they may sit within the molds of uncertainty -which in effect is rooted in keeping us safe- so is our curiosity born from something which seems pleasing, or positively intriguing no less. A great example is that person who first entered the water. “We don’t know what’s in there!” someone said, to which others joined in, “and its cold, and we’re not able like fish!” Still, something drew someone for the first time; and when they went into somewhere relatively shallow and clear, they probably threw their arms up, yelling “it’s safe, and look,” as they front crawled around, “I cannot float, as you said, or breathe for that matter, but I can swim.” And everyone jumped in then and expanded their limits. That, you might say, is relief of curiosity in a freeing kind. For as we said, nature brought us to care for things close by, as predators and our needs of survival were always paramount. But as those worries grew less dense, so did the veil of danger thin, giving our curiosity more scope, and according subjects to see. These are the mysteries of freedom as we’ll call them. “For who, in more troubled times, would have the time to make ironic comedies: so privileged were those Greeks!”

 <div id="natureshand">
    So art is life in a way, or rather the response we have to things marks our persisting nature. “For there is always something to amend, and we the amenders.” Overall, the cursive so to speak requires concentrated time, either in elaboration or affirmation. I can say on the local scale though that my life is angling itself towards the brightest of those responses. Perhaps, as I’m thinking, our plea to do so is that we feel empty otherwise. And although moving forward is curtailed by an understanding of ends, so are we still best in some form of motion. As it were, too much and you run right over, while those who go too slow come to a stop. And weirdly, rest cannot truly be achieved with the body, for we are always breathing, heeding tomorrow. We can at most be in a resting state, which is to say that our movement forward is more tender than rugged, but also not squishy and soft. And so our draw to the sun is so that our senses are not otherwise on guard; and in those freer ways, does our mind catch fainter things which are farther off; or at least things which shine and glimmer, as opposed to those which feel looming and worth our guard.
    <br>&emsp;The thing is, in this place where more is seen and of a positive kind, our yearn to move forward is that it breathes life which is otherwise not there, for we are not in any alerted state, or need for survival. As we said, the wish to proceed is so our life can feel like its living; for death is known, or the end at least, and being still feels like its right at you, though the result is more anxious than it is of an actual response to death’s prescence. And so we heed what our free mind sees, for we wish to move forward and embrace our time’s delight. Personally, this has become our resolve; and although the reasoning isn’t strong, we are in fact social creatures, meaning we find pleasure and encumbency in partaking with others, for we otherwise feel hidden in our human world. Simply, we wish to post, or at least promulgate what we see, for at least in those moments the merely private thoughts will have a broader sort of company. The former (our thoughts) can hold inquiries and respect for death, but of film, literature, gaming and study, so can that be public. We are free enough to do it, and in terms of what is granted, it is the ability to do so; and achieving this is so when the production is done: and the trouble then is in the experience, or completion rather of the work, as opposed to the profit you make.
    <br>&emsp;In that case, our world is already there, at least the edge of it I can see. But we are not so privileged to have already known or embraced its many portions, or segments at least. These are the fires which our hand moves off of, only in this case the response here is one where we put our signature right on the flame. For, in the former’s case, we are instructed by what will provide us with living; while in the free times of the latter, where the sun draws your gaze, so are we avoiding the scorched effect of idleness, by engraving whats felt about that shine. As it were, we both graze and defend; when the threats are removed though, so are we left with grazing; only, in the case of a monkey or deer, their fine to relax and chew, for their guard is prepped to come back up. “Nothing to do is a relief.” Whereas these modern times have removed the barbarians around, and our inner armories have fallen away. Yet, we are still alive, and of those senses which danger used to attack, so are they present still: the difference being that beauty and opportunity of nature is held more clearly for those senses to see. “Before, opponents and our attention grappled, pairing off like hot and cold. Now, however, the duo is one of appreciation and respect, whereby our partner of nature in her pleasing ways, fairs us a liberal task, ‘where we learn to hold her hand’.”

    As one who is intelligent, the world is never known. Perhaps that is due to our curiosity, in that whenever we’ve reached the end, so do we ask, growing the possibilities further. And this is fine for the most part, as being unprivy to omnisicence, which is to say (fully)aware of what is, benefits one who exists in such enclosure in that they can further refine and define both their views and according amend.
    <br>&emsp;What I’ve noticed in light of this, is that we are more or less asked to reach a conclusion. Not, to be clear, in our views, or rather our sight, but our actions; they must be in motion, advancing at least regardless of end. The issue though, clearly, is just as the world exists despite our knowledge, so can the consequences, or gains rather of our actions, treat us in necessary ways, of which our inital intent would have been other if such ends were known. Yet who are we to ever then say what we should do, ‘for what farthest point can truly heed where all actions should go?’.
    <br>&emsp;Personally, this issue has been rectified over the recent year by the merrits of quality. These, simply amount to what qualifies an action, in that if it were well, or worth trusting by virtue of a welcomed end, that it would be so because it held certain elements, or qualities rather. Whereas in contrast, for brevity sake, we would say that those results which were unfavorable, made the prior course a vain one. Furthermore, we can cleanly define said qualities, with the minor caveat that a lack of whats good will at least make something closer than not to the bad. For example, we may say that irksomeness is an undesirable attribute for our gains to have; but we may be effectively direct about it, and simply say that what is desirable is rest, or at least a return of nourishment and strength; and by virtue of that, if those things are not acquired, then we are by definition, to a degree at least, undesirable of our ends. And, in short, we can rightfully say that the elements, or properties rather, worth our dearest regard, are those of substance, or flavor, constancy, or regularity, and ease, or smoothness via disposition.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, if we are ever more experiencing what we want in both a consistent and accesible way, then of a result we will say that it is of the stoutest kind; and within that mold if the matter is sweet and pure, then of this fully formed way we’ll say, that it is of the strongest kind. I make the distinction of the flavor and form, in that a readied and quick state of drudgery and fear, is no taste one wants, however solid in it’s form. “We want the best and greatest flavors all the time, and without the need to sell our soul, or move mountains that is: from ourselves we’ll say marks the road being right, or with benefit at least when compared to those which require tricks and treks.”

 <div id="cosmologyby5">
    Form wise, it may seem in fact proper for your senority to be when you have children. Though, if child rearing is seen as an element of living, then it can in some sense be part of your adult life, in that you are still doing. The requirments though seem to be guided by intent, as opposed to there being any harsh restriction. And in that case, our own life is whats worth regard, for only when that is full and rich in integrity, will we be fine and able to give.
    <br>&emsp;And, perhaps what I see is that our time as adolescent is really just the latter half of our childhood, whereby we apply what we’ve learned in our youth. For just as one gives a three year old any hard time, so would the outgrowth of that be the beginning of true development -or road to adulthood. In that sense, our adolescence is where we apply ourselves in the world, becoming secure and able to make complete steps. What we are applying though is akin to grammar, in which our youth (or pre-adolescence) is catered upon. What differs though from this model, is traditionally you enter the age of learning, learn grammar from then till the point where you begin applying those skills in higher learning; only then do you apply it in the world. This pains me, for why would you learn the basis for the elements which you would then go and learn? No one speaks that way, as that is more ingrained by mimicry. “No one knows why an orange is called that, but they say so anyway.” And fundamentally, if you can spell one thing, why not the other? And are we really saying that by the time you were seven, that you could not spell? In truth, there were words unfamiliar to me, but our skills were surely the same as they were when we finally came across those. I just think that our youth should be combined, as it were, from elementary through highschool, into a formative period after you are five. If your pupil cannot say a phrase, count arithmically, or write in prose by that time, then your training is off. In fact, my experience is that the reason we need so much time to achieve so, is that we really do little at all. Ask yourself, how much math would you do per week in grade 7? Even if you had an hour 3 times per week, plus some homework, how much time are you really doing math? In particular, how much are you really doing arithmetic, for equations are fairly useless besides technical pursuits? Were raising men, not workers; for if we wish to be technicians, such as engineers, then we’ll learn the formula then. I’m not saying not to learn cosine and circumference, but just as algebra is a the prior step to derivatives, so can all math be traced back to those primary points; and if robustness (of a kind) is not only what we seek, then we’ll apply ourselves then. But don’t we want to be so robust across the field? My student would know the whole of cosmology and astronomy, the history of the world and its dinosaur kings; they’d know who was great, and how empires rose and liberty fell; and they’d admitt passages of purity and greatness, for at least if they were outside freedom’s realm, so could they amend to their misfortune.
    <br>&emsp;I guess, in other words, I don’t see how the mathematical rigor that we need to exist creatively, sincerely and kindly in the world, could not be achieved in 5 years, whereby we’d then allow those who had learned to go and apply themselves in those behavioral kinds. For what are we doing otherwise? And by virtue of contemporary thinking, do you really need anything to achieve a common trade? And imagine, sitting someone through the passivity and formalities of grade 1 through 12, where they could instead engage with the whole of knowledge from the earliest years, then run through the world as they can, painting and addressing wherever they go. Then, for the sake of argument, if all else failed and the concerns of tradition prevailed, they’d get a trade. An even more contemporary thought is that pursuits of anything less within elsewhere kinds, is in fact less oppertune and treating. “Journeymens over liberal Art majors in debt.”
    <br>&emsp;So, in summary, our child will go through their youth in a much briefer time, advancing into adolescence during their teenage years. By 20 they should be a man, working to blossom from that most secure mold. Personally, as a parent, this takes nothing more that generosity and sincere regard; the teachings from us require nothing more than time, and the application of the student need not more than the simplicities of a roof and bread. They can find their own way then, truly. For we may still hold a leash as they go out into the world, for in that stance they are merely learning in a fuller position. But having then grown, they can then fully be, whereby they truly apply what they’ve acquired into something personal to themselves. By then, may we offer what we have, as a dowrie of sorts. In preparation, we could define our child’s rearing as one of a local kind; for we will want the support and comfort of family and home during the early years, and although not restricted, we may not wish to or need to travel during their learning years. When they can helm themselves though in that adolescent sense, so may we all go, for in foreign lands they will be able to walk besides us. Or in another sense, the place for child rearing is that stretch where you have to carry them, which is to say till the end of their youth. This, reasonably, is about 10 years, ‘for who could not run and speak by then? The parent just needs to raise them so that they can be brought along’.
    <br>&emsp;As per our plan, we can define it as needing to reach a point where a child’s youth can be developed. And in terms of expectation, we could say that from this point of ours from adulthood and beyond, that we are going through a stage perhaps, whereupon its completion we’d be ready to give, or at least live in that truly generous way. But, just as one’s youth is the first half of things and adolescence the other, so could we consider our blossoming years (as an adult) as the youth of that, while the adolescent portion is where we spill over, and give. For as it were, this point of our life is simply that where we have an unadorned aim; this does not mean that duty and care take no attention, or that our ends will effortlessly come to be; but rather, we’ve been firm enough and constant to see an aim born from the right experience. As the effort is still required, so are we growing. Perhaps all I mean to say, is that right now were conjuring the sincerest of generosity, in that our core is taken care of in its aim, and our helming of this will bring out our dearest gain. In comparsion to what a child needs though, in that must our gifts be known, in that what was true was already given, or rather generated by me. “For we are then full, as in the blossomed state of a complete mold.” And upon that, our offerings will be encumbunat, spilling over if you will, for we had not only reached a point where we are made, but where the truth in that was claimed: and only from there will we truly give, for we then had much to offer. “And the interest of reaching so is what bars me from seeking that overly generous claim, for I am in fact seeking our fullest self, whereupon reaching so our satisfaction will come from giving it away.” ####Term wise I cannot say, but this is at least the mark of our adhultood blossoming; from that point where we have a gift, to the latter of its state I might say, though this may be another point I do not know.

 <div id="rightandwrong">
    It is clear that we are incomplete. For in our lack, I can tell that we are so. Descriptions though seem pail in comparison to remarking on our actual living, which at this point is minor.
    <br>&emsp;As a man, I care for other people. But right here, the crux of an issue lies, ‘for who would prefer the company of liars over themselves’. The reason is simple, in the sense that sugar is indeed a comfort, albeit poor in consequence, or lacking nourishment at least. People are like this, as their actions may in fact run contrary to well-founded living. This is so, for in our environment and our nature through it, there is a lucrative way; that is, one which yields us with the tenets of good living. For one thing, the means for this is primarily qualified over multiple entries, ‘for randomly choosing each step will not hold a profit forever’. We also are not trying to learn everything for this sake of wellness, but rather notice things about ourselves as to develop a genuine scale. Only, certain questions and curiosities may embellish, leading us to inquire about things far known. In that search, inquiry marks our forward output, as we sketch what we see around; science then confirms this via skepticism, for our view may not be as it personally seems. The strength of knowledge then is that it reflects what is indeed true; and as a practical measure, we can say that of those things which should be known, is found through inquiry, and of those verified, or reasoned upon at least, makes them laudable to act on.
    <br>&emsp;The struggle here is in learning about the world compared to assessing ourselves; for if we are anxious, or at least attentive to a moment of rest, then understanding what constitutes both the experience and cause of this, will angle us sincerely to the world. Only, as war never seems fitting, of a choice that is for peaceful outputs, so is it unclear where and when we should arrange ourselves to experience what we must. In a weird way, our definition of the world may in fact be a reflection of ourselves. For we may say that a man’s life is marked by death, but in effect this is merely a conclusive jump born from it appearing from me, regarding us personally and how we are bound for so. I’m not sure if family and friends are really a factor of our lives; or better said, that even if observation deals me with such, is that sound? For what range are we accounting for, and to which end, for could such elements not change?
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps the strongest reasoning is an evalutive one; for in all things are we acting, but really our inquiry is born for the sake of acquiring what is right and wrong. These are so though on a desirable end, or a positive one at least. “For none ask and define so that they may fail; assumptions aside, our ends are at least banked on what seems positive, even if it is only to us: or rather, that within the world as it is, and, in a way, what actions would in fact serve us in who we actually are, so might our view be off. But even the fool has his own desirable end.” This is the mighty question then, which at first glance centers on deciding what is right and wrong: only, I see another. Simply, what makes the aims of a masochist false, while those of a volunteer correct? Well, in laying it all out, there are apparent shortcomings for the former, while none for the latter. But better said, the one who serves has very little taken of them which is of worth, nor can they ever fail to give, and in turn earn the pleasure of doing so; or better yet, giving expansively in the rewards that it offers -whereas drugs give less and less as they require more. The details of one who harms themselves, or wishes to be harmed, or harm others, or see others harmed, may in fact derive them pleasure; but I only suspect that family, confidence, self-respect of a sincere kind and other things of our common sort, exist roughly within these course of actions. “For you are either capturing, or being done so, which appears to offer little lasting rest or content.” By virtue of that, these ends seem set to eventually wain, and are otherwise hard to acquire by virtue of the pain involved. “For rebuttal or escape riles your subject.”
    <br>&emsp;Now, the heart of our inquiry, is how can we discern what appears right, and in a way is locally positive, from that which is actually proper, in that its positive result is one of real worth. In other words, if I am a thief, then my success in doing so will not yield me the highest result of man. Whereas, an attention and care to death, family, leisure and friends, upon success, will yeild me a life which qualifies more highly. In a word, as if life were our aim, would the best shot be the one which hit the middle of the best mark? “And the struggle of the scholar, the boy, is that he not only will miss the core of that latter mark, but that the world will reflect on so, and usher him to hit the center of one less righteous.”

 <div id="eternityorends">
    Let’s say, for instance, that death were in fact final. Regardless if this was in fact preferred, we can at least be sure what it is, and otherwise amend our prior time accordingly. On the latter, if the case were contrary, and typical let’s say in that we were judged, then our living time would be best to respect the conditions which most favorably determined our eternal end. Seeing, however, that the finality of death requires nothing for us -for we will be nothing- than no fear or concern of consequence need be regarded. “This isn’t to confuse our aniticpations of being in such state, only that which and whatever they are, banks little on how we are before.” Weirdly though, that being within nothing affords no experience familiar to those living; which is to say, that neither hope or apprehension are present, ‘for in that final state, we are none, resting, sincerely at ease, for our actions are forgone and ill set on happening, which, in effect, means theres nothing to be fearful of or excited for, as if we could in fact grow -or change’. That is the ultimate question. Not as to whether our ignorant claims will come true, but whether it will be one which treats us the most preferable, in that we are free to be free, and accordingly occurs by our current virtue of being, in that, definitively, we are done -or final. So my doubts are such that the void of space feels, well, empty. This seems obvious, but to be clear, all I mean is that there appears to be no void at all. “For where is there nothing truly?” Everything else seems to be considerable, ie. the emptyness of space, of which there are still properties, and what not. In any case, this does not remove any notion of there being nothing beyond death. Better put though, it is not so simple to say that if there is nothing more than material, which is to say that myths are unnecessary to explain every single thing, that death would then itself be explained. In fact, I only define death as well as I can relate it to something similar, being sleep. Though, of a peaceful kind, which in a way holds our experience at least within the realm of nothing, ‘that is, rest’. And so, our range is not appropriately known. For one, the cause of death is in regards to tissue, or our body going astray. But even then, if ‘we’ are somehow but attached to that, or at least the part of us which is alongside that body, then the question of where it goes is an unclear one. “For the timeless concern, is whether or not we end?” In that, I make happy claims that if it were so, that this would suitably compare to nothing, and thus be appropriately described as peaceful. Still, that we will end is not clear.
    <br>&emsp;At any rate, the belief in it being otherwise holds its strength, or reasoning at least, on two fairly frail stands. For one, we wish it to be so, for we either desire what the afterlife could bring, or are otherwise afraid of what nothing bestows. On this last count, the obvious dispute is that our ignorance and poor thinking of what nothing means -or our end rather- makes us fear it accordingly. Personally, at a glance, it is quite easy and sound to describe it as a peaceful state, ‘for nothing is going on’. Considering these as motivations, the second aspect reflects our negation of an otherwise truth. For starters though, we must be explicitly set on the fact that the lack of certainty for nothing, does not claim any for the eternal realm. Unless either has undeniable truth, then likelihood is all we’ll get. In that though, for each, there is reasoning that proports strength in each side of belief. Since the case in point is to do with our ultimate end though, ‘it is hard not knowing’. And in fact, all actions are in a way rendered mute, seeing as there is the possibility that depending on the ones we take, a lasting (or at least further) consequence can be yeilded. In addition, if we are sure of our end -within nothing’s embrace- then so will we be free, ‘for our end holds nothing but an open door’. Whereas, if we only know the reasons for the alternative to not be true, so is the former unnecessarily so. For all we know in that case, is that there is no heaven or hell, but if there are routes beside that, only can a specific certainty disclose. In simpler terms, the negative of our contrary is not proof of the latter’s place, for the case here is at most symbolically opposed; ‘yet, how can we be sure that our destination is not in some other recess, or nearby point of ridges’. To be clear, removing strength from eternity and weakness from our end, does give us means for rest, or confidence at least. But so can’t we know.
    <br>&emsp;Let’s be real however. If our end is so, then nothing is required of us, ‘for our dissipation comes so easy’. Thus, if we are confident that such an end is true, then the according lack of requirment can also be stood behind. In any case, so long as there is doubt that this is so, then we cannot fully believe that our path is so -and its granted accord. Moreover, seeing as the lack of certainty here allows for suspicion elsewhere, so must those accords be heeded. At any rate, eternity may be hard to disprove; and seeing as its claim is on our actions before death, so does its lingering head need regard. This is the conflict you see, for even if we believe it not so, its otherwise partial claim still signals its demands; and ignoring those consequences (if left undealt), fares gravely to those who were false in acting otherwise.
    <br>&emsp;Nevertheless, we may have little reason to believe that the afterlife is true; and in that case, we may harbor the potential harm of ignoring it. And otherwise, if an end is not truly known, than so can other possibilities be regarded (alongside eternity). For the principle at least, is that an end or not, covers only some of the ground. “For just as the universe is not too slow, or too fast, but moves just enough to lower its pace, but never stops.” Still, just as we can let the rust of eternity linger in the back of our mind, so can we dispose ourselves to an otherwise end, lavishing at least in its most likely promise. We cannot be certain, but confident rather, that what such an end requires, is a good thing to respect. For even if we were foolish not to uncover lurking possibilities, so is the case for Nothing overly grown; and understandably at least, that just as those before ignorantly fell under God’s command, so can we now happily go, to where we not know, but pleasingly to our hopeful end. “How ironic, that the peril of eternity is but a scar of our certainty, lingering by the merrits of not being clear otherwise. Moreover, how nice is it, that what is so worth achieving is something which holds no consequences or demand. How weird is it that we’d be foolish to accept that course, and what, be mistaken, and given what’s otherwise.”
 </div>
 <div id="preferredrest">
    So, in summary, our end may be or not so. If it is the latter, this only means there will be no real peace or rest, while the former means otherwise. A tricky component though, is differing an afterlife from nothing. For, the former may seem like an end, and be peaceful at that, but it is still something of sorts. Moreover, is it banked on both a positive and negative end -heaven or hell. What seems to be the case, is that when we are gone, so is our experience. For, as it were, all our experience is right now is akin to syllables of a word, where the case here holds things akin to thoughts and speech. In particular, talking amounts to muscles producing consonants and vowels, whereby the tongue cuts them (so to speak) as to produce variety. “Think of saying Faaaa, and Ooooh.” At any rate, these are not some phenomena, at least as outputs. Where and how their produced, or originate from rather, is more complex, but we can at least say that be it of some dualistic mind, or computational/responsive conduct of tissue, that the results are object like.
    <br>&emsp;In a word though, the truth seems more in line with the latter. And, just as words are made accordingly, so are images and other cognitive elements of our waking experience. If these are truly born of tissue, or at least (as products) are themselves born and of a tissue’d kind, then so is the dissassembly of that which outputs so, a valid mechanism by which our experience simply grows from containing those mental elements, to one where we do not. In other words, the birth of matter is the origin of us, and as it configured, so did it create those mental objects. Death, it seems, in a practical way reflects the limit of that configuration, whereby the bodies molecules can no longer retain their general form -which is to say, that we do age and grow, but so do we remain a person, where death is the removal of that.
    <br>&emsp;This is a very natural way of looking at it. Although the dynamics of will and ingenuity are hard to describe, in their products at least, so can we fairly set these as elements which we don’t understand. “But so with a mystery, can we qualify who the perp would be.” Our remarks then are akin to our ancestoral insight that the seasons occur, and that planting food in accordance can yeild a surplus. We, in this modern sense, are making no different of accounts, only in this case the apparent mark of death ahead is whats drawn our gaze. Again, the dynamics are hard, but just as the history of man and his dextrous resovle can be traced to erectus, hominins, cyodants and eukaryia in general, so can his regard for death be addressed via the same root; which is to say the domain of reality itself. For it brought matter into its configurations, of which stars, planets, microbes and self regard were made.
    <br>&emsp;In a word then, description marks our interest, for we know that we are comparable to the rest, and by virtue of that equally born of existence’s origins, to which our only aim is to understand how our particular arrangement will proceed. On that account, we know that we’ll disassemble. Here though, we can see that all things worth being afraid of are unable to be administered: “For the means by which they poorly treat us, has no vessel to corrode.” And although complex, the goods of living being absent, is no far trouble, especially for one who is not ignorant. For we are not talking about things which make us vain, but the true wonders of nature and her delight. These however are mere fortunes of being so free, ‘as our watchful eye is granted leave to stair at the stars’. The organ is the same though, however liberated in seeing more pleasant things: and the suiter of those instruments, whether in danger or awe, simply wants rest. “There is much reason to think that our glorious stair, is but a less harsh interest in need of clarity -as a broken twig behind that is.” Defining this as rest, as our grand aim that is -in liberal or wretched chains- removes any hesitance from death’s bareness of living. “For that in its most is still but a preferred route to being, which is to say that through more positive clarities, we acquire rest.” And that’s what death is.
 </div>
 <div id="messagesfordeath">
    What would you do if your actions in life accounted for your experience upon its end? This is a tricky question. For one, we generally take granted both that this is in fact true, but more importantly we presume, or at least are keen on advice given, with respect to what actions would be suitable -if the former was true.
    <br>&emsp;The thing is that heaven and hell are fairly characterized, as if there were literal doors, helmed by a man no less. In this sense, the appropriate conduct towards such ‘familiar bends’ is one that seems unfounded. Nevertheless, the motivation in this case may be sound, or at least we’d rightly qualify our actions based on their consequences. The real question then, is how can we be sure that our resolutions are correct? That is, what do preferable ends need, which we’ll assume means heaven, and what actions correspond to that in an effective way?
    <br>&emsp;The problem, is that there is almost no reasoning behind this. People do have insights and or experiences, but these usually amount to some indirect or direct message, ‘as if a whisper from the land in which we seek to enter’. Only, we still must tie our shoes, and are otherwise ordained to breathe, eat, sleep, and more or less persevere. Adding efforts aimed at our final end is no false treatment, but doing so may in fact run contrary to those former. In any case, the lack of reasoning for why were doing such amends is the critical fault; for despite one’s confidence in the messenger, what exactly have we learned? What is it about the aim we have, and its nature in other words, that asks us to do something in a ceratin way? Because personally, what it seems to me, is that these whispers amount to suggestions for one as they proceed through the normal world. As it were though, this simply means that as natural actions occur, so is there a right one, the guidance of which were given.
    <br>&emsp;The main concern though, is that besides these messages, which in a way amount to nothing more than principles or occasional actions, they do not detail how in any given moment we should proceed. Who is to say that one action would be or would not be of a certain? But the problem rears its head then; for all were trying to do is amend to the keeper who holds heaven’s door, and as if it were held with content, meaning that those in charge knew that none would so effortlessly come through the door. Or in other words, we are by our own natures unprivy to what eternity seeks, which is why any minor insights are so precious.
    <br>&emsp;Strangely enough though, man has resolved himself to ask about all the things that his guidance has not treated him. In a way, this is fair, for the Gods must mean for us to question upon their offered rules (of principle that is), how in any given scenario one should act with respect to them. Only, in our growing age, so has that consideration turned to the nature of inquiry itself, whereby we ask what the ends really are, and whether the realm around is really present, and there for us to rightfully amend. Perhaps it is, but at least so far, Man’s previous descriptions have been revealed as wrong. Again, on the whole of it he’s not gone too far, but in the specifics he evidently has. This may be his one failure, while the mold above welcomed a truth otherwise. In effect though, as the truth in things has become known, the realm itself has begun to loose its claim. Personally, I find its place an overwhelming one, and not neccessarily a preference. Still, I will admitt its worth in regard, but only because I am not sure otherwise, or completely unsure of itself.

 <div id="confirmation">
    Peace seems the most pleasing, if even freedom could grant us such. It is perhaps our real condition, that time has gone on, for we’ve developed from a troubled stage, into eras which seem by gone. Yet, in our liberated ways, we know not how to live: and the prediciment is that we must -or risk being idle- while referencing the fact that we currently don’t know how. In this sense, we are ordained to solve this problem. How is one to live when life is truly given? Your free, set, clear to run your line: but which one is it? Hmmm, what do I really seek? I’ve spent my years training for war and conflict, or at least in recent times the focus has been on opportunity and progress. What will I now do that all that could be hoped for is gained? The stars seem ever brighter, and the land around seems quiet and plain, yet what am I, as a member, to do with it?
    <br>&emsp;And my anwser comes down to the notion of purpose; yet the rounding figure of all this is that we truly want rest. An example might illustrate the point. Our father is sick, and as it were he is not in good health by his own merrits. What I would say to him is that he should exercise, yet he believes it futile or without promise. To this I say he is stubborn. If I were to be more direct though, I might mistakenly say that his error is in being stubborn; but this is really a twisting of the real concern, which is that he doesn’t take care of his health. I may suggest that his receptivity to this is lacking, but such stiff-headedness is not the real cause, but rather the heated surface surrounding the core issue of his lack of exercise. Comparing this to what we previously said, I would say that a purpose will bring one in line with themselves, and through bad times carry them forward, or in good times keep them content and focused. This, more or less, seems to be what were looking for in our liberal ways. Only, as in that example, the core issue here (in this instance I mean) is of rest -or the actual shortcoming of exercise (as in that last instance). This is primarily so for that is what a remedy of our condition is staked towards. And, as we’ve mentioned prior, that one’s confirmation of their secure surroundings (in primitive days) is no different than ones tribute to the stars; their each marks, of which our response is drawn as to bring us in line with them. For each though, the harmony brings rest. And so in our free ways we remain conditioned. As to what exactly, that can be further discussed; but in short we can agree that things do still draw us, albeit of a more positive kind. “The idea being that our senses open up to the broader environment as those near handed threats recede.” And in a way, if I saw the stars for instance, and my response to them was to write, chart, reflect, discuss and or constuct, then you could say, that to my purpose, it was in aligning ourselves to those, the objective being one of increased resolution and inquiry, ‘as if were refining a spot which we inched closer towards’. And you could say, if asked why such actions were in place, that they served the purpose of bringing harmony, or in other words they relieved your condition. Just as one would say that the purpose of exercise was health, so too could the mere relfection of ourselves be explained as a means of learning who we are, and establishing a richer grasp -which is what we mean to do when we identify and tribute the stars, or things of wonder.
    <br>&emsp;“I think, in short, that this idea of rest, or what we call peace, is the most usefull idea around, for it both explains why someone would do what they would in ancient times, and those where they are free. Only, I feel like the substance in need of refinement is in disclosing and thus affirming the fact that in such open and clear times, do we, and if so, what do we actually see?. For the treatment of that is what marks the purpose of relieving our otherwise idle condition: yet what if our eyes are closed?”

 <div id="tonothing">
    For simplicity sake, the spawn of, or at least effected impetus which gave rise to matter, is itself the rear half of our origins. What we are though, as in the sameness of a person from birth to death -in that as a person they stay- so are we the same -by virtue of our spot within the configuration- by the roots of the Sun, its planetary debris, the heat and its effects on the ground and atmosphere, the process which naturally shaped the world from here and all the complexity born from that: the end being us, or of mammals, eutherians, hominins and Homo.
    <br>&emsp;And so when one asks, ‘where did we come from’, they must be clear in whether their asking where they, as a strand of all things, in particular came, or how (as if it were the same altogther, differing only within the domain) the whole, or matter that is, came to be. “Why is there anything at all,” is a angle to this question that differs from, “how did my particular form within things, come to be?”
    <br>&emsp;For those who are the age of five, I would say keep reading as to make your faculties up to a speculative par; but for those who are near eight, then I would say, in counsel, that figuring out the answer for both, can be helmed more effectively by stamping in a suitably explicit line of distinction, between the lineage of the whole, and the latter itself; whereby we, fairly, attribute the former aspect as all those things derived from the sun, while the components of that -be it galaxies and atoms- are given more fundamental regard as to how they (as the root elements of matter) came to be. It is true that we could simply say that atoms and what not mark that explicit line, of which we sit on one end as products, while the unknown lurks deeper as the atom’s cause. But, simply, we can at least rest ourselves on the notion that beyond the fundamental concern, that of its impetus to things itself, that regions of its consequent massiveness are themselves appropriately considered as derivivaties of the locales within said regions of massiveness: stars.
    <br>&emsp;Imagine if all objects were in fact not so, but rather figures of an otherwise primary matter. Now, one might say that such element itself would have to bow to the laws of existence and the according continuity. I will consent to that, but only so much as were sure that the element itself is of a kind which is always lasting. Now, this is a bit circular, but working from the back, we can see that at the very least a reason for it being so (real and constant) is not neccessarily so by virtue of the apparent constancy of its products. That is, if we are mere figures of it, then so would the inconstancy of it mean we are as well. Even in literal terms, we brush away like erosion by the wind; only, where do those dust particles go: and could they not be but mere elevations (of a granular sort) in an otherwise flat, or receding existence?
    <br>&emsp;In other words, the main element is all that matters; or at least so much as the products of it are but mere figures of it, then so will those fates meet the same. The question then, is why does there have to neccessarily be something at all? That there is something per say, is no evidence of there actually being anything; for although the dynamics of what ‘nothing’ would be otherwise, wherein the supposed prescence of things suggests there is something, fairs only so ostensibly, which is to say that, perhaps, that such evident things are but sprouts of nothing ceasing to be so, but is (literally) none the less. “That is perhaps the hardest concept, but only because in my conceit to what is in fact not, makes it hard to identify otherwise: for I must contest against there being something, by saying its not there.”
    <br>&emsp;I am trying to describe those sprouts, in that they are like reflections in the mirror, but not reflective of the mirror itself. Why the medium (so to speak) sprouts is one thing, and why its nature is such that its ‘nothingness’ is not always contained, is not clear. But per the model, all these things which we see, from suns to empty space, are but mere sprouts of reality rippling in its folds. The words limit us in this case, for we can sit cleanly on the spot of ‘nothing being the aim’ -to which our nature as the sprouts of that reflect. But of such folds, are they not of an existence? But at this point there is a limit, or prescence of fallacies otherwise (if we affirm otherwise, with ignorance) in our depiction. I have it though. At least I can say what it is I am trying to describe. It is not so much a negation, as if what we believed was of existence can in fact be taken away; but in that, the nothing I speak of is not exactly so, for in this case we are simply saying that by virtue of something being removed, nothing follows. In fact, if I may digress, this marks a fairly basic mistake; that is, if we take a plate and say it has no food, then were saying that within the medium there is absence; but of this, we only mean that there is an emptiness to the mold, or holder. Space follows this formost, in that even it, in all its emptiness, is not really so. Here, to me at least in our primitively future driven age, the core problem arrives. How is there anything not of space? For if that is absent of all which we’d call things, but is composed of something itself, then how is there not something everywhere? How could nothing ever be? I suspect that it is all in the wording, in that its not that the emptyness of space, in being so universal, is in fact of existence (so to speak), and thus making a presence of something everywhere, but rather, that the mold, or plate, is in fact nothing itself, and accordingly home to ‘things’ -ie. food on, but not present to a plate- which are in fact not true things themselves: instead, they are what anything amidst a void would be, at least sincerely, nothing. “For me personally, the ostentible flavor to physics, and the misappropriation of ontology based on existence, dissolves under the relief of the greatest anwser, the question of which is, how is all not so, when in fact there is but mere glimmers shining through nothing, yet there is, postively, partial things which appear absolutely so? For where do they as unexisting things go, if they are in fact somewhat so? Or is nothing not simply an abscence, or openess on the plate thats so, but a nature which (overall), reflects the pieces struggling to be amidst the destiny of a ‘nothing’ course?” And the virtue of that, is that short of our descriptions to do so, that all, if under a course for being not, is not a mark of full being, or at least of true things which become not; for of what appears so, they are present by the fate and treatment of the mold they exist in; and if a mold is either not there, or (by our limits) set for nothing itself, then so are the products of that of an according sort. “Whereby the products of a nature which was bound for its own self and such products, would make the former at least equally cogent with the wholeness of that core matter; yet, if the latter (self- core matter) was not something (by virtue of it heading away from being full), then would the strands of that not be of an equally (destined) dissolute sort?”

 <div id="confession">
    I’ve never lacked humility, rather a non-contempuous ease, as to approach problems and theory without pride or insecurity.
    <br>&emsp;At any rate, I am reading Tolstoy’s confession, and the prose has me intrigued. However, he makes rather extreme positions regarding the rational view of life’s meaninglessness, and, the admittedly fair (by this context) comparison of faiths alternative place as the sole means of finding that meaning. As he puts it, ‘there is the finite which were part of, and the infinite which we can reckon, yet by all reasonable accounts, the latter is composed of nothing, and so to our fates; yet, by the former’s account, the end is one where eternity is our claim, yet in believing this to be so, you are attesting to the faith you have in it, rather than reasonable expectation’.
    <br>&emsp;And for the most part I see strength in this. Moreover, despite my early restraint, I found myself ceasing defense as I understood my own life was more in line with faith, rather than reason. But, the crux of all this scouring, is due to the value that is placed on nothing, and its according meaninglessness. For one, I cannot vouch for their statements, as I at most know the heart of it; yet, explicitly, he remarks (citing Schopenhour) that the world is indeed meaningless and of nothing, but then attributes evil to this and the life were in. This confuses me. I guess the argument goes that something is preferable to nothing, and that because we are destined for the latter, so is the former a farce. And I won’t make an ignorant appeal that their thinking is off, for I am in most ways willing to accept their findings. Yet, their evaluation, which I must stand firm in negating further sophistries, holds no bearing for me.
    <br>&emsp;This is so, for the nothing I see, personally or at least of agreement with them, is not so negative in my mind. In fact, I would describe the barreness which they define as one of favor, as I put it, like a dark, dreamless, tranquil sleep. That portrait may not in fact be fair or accurate to make regarding our time within death, but that it may be, or would be rather, is in itself a preference. This is why I refute further lines of relations (or sophistry), for the reality of my life is born of action, or rest, and the judgment of words heeds no experience for me. As it were, reasoning and logic hold more truth in propositions, in that they make results seem more clear. “Meaning is just that, in regards to something, that its meaning remarks the outcome of it.” And if someone were to say that the outcome of our death, or at least our time and place within nothing, would be poor, then to that I can discern. But effectively, I see little room for this point, as they are merely painting the world with words, but leaving out action, or at least the objects which are subject to the place in which their reasoning reflects. And I personally cannot see how a state of nothingness can offer anything really, and that when I think of this from my living state, I feel accurate in attesting to the lack of threats and fear, and that however little hope or ectasy there is, so will my bodies abscence reproach from this, sinking into the peaceful void instead.
    <br>&emsp;The arguments are one thing, and to them I cannot refute. But, even if I take their reasoning, which I cannot say beyond sophistic relations offers any insight as to what meaningless (and nothing) mean, all I can do is accept them as terms of reality, and evaluate them from my place within living. And having done so, I see no reason to fear; for as Buddha says, our suffering in life is generally born from ignorance, that we let ourselves get carried away with strides of gluttony and ambition, and forgo fortifying efforts to incur industry and or strength, along with the use of those dutie’s fruits.
    <br>&emsp;I will define myself as a man of privilege, for I live in a home that has grown further than middle class, and nationally and naturally, my land is one of rights and liberty. So I can see a bit further as my posture is not so worn down. Yet, I do know pain, in both the frazzled conflict that sprouts from ignorances which accompany me through this flourishing -personally or with others- and our general involvement in the acts and deeds within these richer times. And by that account, despite earning a large reward, I long ago recognized that without adhering to the tasks that earned me this bounty, that achieving them would still be a chore; moreso, would more effort neccessarily come, in maintence for instance, and of that I’d be unprepared. And again, I am coming from a fortunate state that has the luxury of struggling in an air-conditioned room, but of patience, respect, punctuality and fortitude, I am ordained to address. And having done so, I can now hold with tenderness and might, all those gifts of modernity and man. Yet, in being so astute in our receptivity, ‘as if we had forgone showing up drunk to the altar’, we are now upright with our riches, resting with them, running with them, stabily, kindly, sincerely, through which the world is able to be seen, entire, plain, clean. And by this account, I can say that the end I seek is truly one that is past these fortunes, as these are but fruits of our condition, the sentence of which is paired with my body -for be it amidst kings or serfs, my body needs food, and not even I have enough equity to pardon me from the work needed to meet the cost of bread.
    <br>&emsp;Consequently, my place as man is similar to those past, in that this body I have is a burden, for it seeks and needs, rightly to which I reply, but also shamefully to which I must obstain. Yet, I cannot say why this trouble is worthwhile, for I do not know. I can speak to the glamor and aim I have amidst our stable ways, but likely that is from a privileged position. For I genuinely understand those who were lower class, and of older times, who did not in fact have many fruits beyond surviving the day, and that such a laborous sentence did in fact lighten under the promise of an eternity following. And this offer does seem to be one that claims that such time will be like now, only without the burdens. “So that our dreams amidst war, or our intermediary pleasures following work, seem like a coming constant; that is, all that we wish for, as rooted in and born from life, is staked as our reward for making it through, the meaning of which marbles such state as having faith in heaven.”
    <br>&emsp;My point, is that in this privileged state of burden, which surpasses the muddied crags of true labors, but is inferior to the autonomous freedman (be it noble or elite), the road ahead is dear. Simply, we have a grip on our post, standing on it, seeing it with brimmness and cheer; we are not so put down as not to see, nor too free as to have no strength in our spine to stand tall enough to see. We are present, engaged, but through reason and flourishing the task is gripped in our han. “And holding that instrument the world appears all.” Through that might then, I am not convinced that we are even asking the proper question, for if our life really has meaning, so would the condition that prompted that question bar one from asking it; for has it really lifted enough for you to cease attention and ask? “Its like your in class, watching the clock to see when you can go, and as it takes a year to go two seconds, you ask the point; yet in this you have forgone the point that had you there in the first place, as you are only now asking, but from a state that was ready to go.”
    <br>&emsp;And by those accounts I hold my positions closer to our place as subjects; which is to say that in all and entirety there may be no meaning, but of the objects and bodies around, so do those natures apply. And to me, the absence of neurology and sense marks an equally comparable progression as in the case for acquiring the ability to walk, or speak, or those reflections made when you first became a man; that similar to these aspects being birthed into form then saturated, so are the products of that fairly removed as the body is segmented. And, for instance, the moral of humanity is not really an ultimate claim, as it too is a subject within entirety; but, red and blue may not be anything different in the absolute, but as far as that has come to be, theres a difference (as our labels suggest); but, even if their peculiarities are in fact identical, so can we subject them as unique, however limited our referencing is. “For what a man is, I do not know, for I know no things; yet, of things and whatever they are, there is one called man; who, despite his confidence that he is unique amongst partial things, in that his mind gives him a destiny towards that infinte space beyond the finite of things, he too forgets what, as a man, he is as a thing in that finite domain.”
    <br>&emsp;And personally, to reiterate, my positions gravitate towards the sides which say that our view of what’s outside the finite comes from our misuse as finite things. Now, even if I confess our knowledge of such far things, I still am not bothered by what they mean for this thing I am. For, the sole prompt (as I see it), for this regard of the infinite, is that it draws us, like a moth to flame, as an escape from this struggle within the finite. Yet, for me, the hand that offers itself from outside this common realm, is not one that suggests it will improve the life I have, but rather offers the means to give me what I truly seek in that life: what I would have if it were not for the load which causes the burden in the first place. “Through nothing my body thankfully goes, and thus its claim on me has no hold, and I am given peace and rest, in nothing. For only is something desired due to the body being pressed, for under freedom it would in fact move, yet our condition makes it a debt, as we must treat it. And consequently we ask and pray, that the movement our chained body wished to make could be following our release.+++++”
    <br>&emsp;My theory though, is that whatever life there is to give, comes while the body is present, and that through self regard and grace, we can make the most of it, happily even, so much as we are chained. But, as I have seen, even as those shackles are removed and we are able to run, so is rest what I seek: for when I go, I eventually stop, and am pleased to. In that state where the body has moved and its prominence is absent, so are we then of peace, for we are truly not, but happily having moved. The key element, however, is that when you are alive, that rest is a garnish to the movement you inevitably do, be it burdened or free’d. And in that life I do prefer the latter, perhaps because my movements of that kind settle into points of rest, as opposed the relief that comes from being done with what burdens you -yet only intermediately.
    <br>&emsp;Again though, this is what I am saying from this admittedly privileged point of view, but a well grasped one no less. And from here, my time with real living has given me the experience of real rest, which is to say when the body has moved and is free to do so no more. And it is in that which I find the dearest experience, as if the burden of the body -who even in the best of times still needs to move- has vanished, and I can simply, freely and peacefully be. I see no weakness in concluding that nothing would be more of the sort, as the darkest points of sleep would suggest; and as those are but the cream of the active-resting crop, so does an eternity of that appeal to me, at least as a promise or meaning through my struggle to succeed. “Which, I’d say, explains how I’ve reached this conclusion, for in that struggle to success, I’m glad, for not has been given, as my past has clearly shown that not but me can prevent our fortunes being whithered away, but so to our actual address, which is a real state of non-being, whereby we’ve let go, having already been.” And it appears to me that those who see this are those who helm what is burdened upon them, as if a neccessary response, and made forth to where their drawn, as if a positive response; for this is where rest truly comes, as your activity hasnt been of burliness and constraint, but real expression and strides, the soul of which sees one settled and complete, ‘whereby the colors of ends, have already been reached’.

 <div id="redandblue">
    Simply put, the best thing is to consider what you have to do. At the very least, we must consider whether there are consequences when we die, because if there are, then we are most prudent to advise.
    <br>&emsp;As it were, the claims that there are, be it of heaven or hell, seem to come from testimony and faith, which together feel unreliable or verified. Moreover, on a technical front whereby we use pure reason to dissolve, I feel no one has offered a well-rounded take on how everything’s come to be, at least not so much as (such theory) reflects how things (in the current) are. Nor, by any means that aren’t rooted in those histories or our emotions, is it clear how we should ‘reasonably’ oblige. Or, perhaps, if we knew the truth about things, then there’d be more room for us to orient ourselves appropriately. But as it were, we know not the outer layer and the voided enclosure, nor are we by these accounts apt in our views of the subjects within such absolute realms. In other words, our definitions of things are incomplete, for as things, we know not what they are and thus what they mean, for the roots that birth them -and as the beginning acts as part of the end- so is entirety needed to be known.
    <br>&emsp;This very question feels sufficient in offering us the treaty of reproach, whereby we humor the fact that of this ultimate question -and its varying points- that we don’t know. Nothing else has any true meaning, for no purpose or cause can be referred to. There are theories mind you, or approaches if you will, that allow for an advancement of our knowledge which is paired within both an adjustive and respectively incomplete set of actions. Still, the rump of this holds its own entirety, for even our incomplete actions need some stable end. “It only seems appropriate that with such certainty, we’d make only so far as we are sure of its extent, but privy to its limit, and thus more like a guess.”
    <br>&emsp;By those facts, we will hold truth to the realm of subjects, which is to say that we know not that there are things, for we know not what things are, but at least amongst us where subjects are held, is one called man. Just as there is red and blue in terms of subjects, so is there a creature capable of industry, reasoning, reflection and delight. Yet, he is akin to the Gods in his complexion, for he in some ways controls that which binds him, but differs though in that he is not so powerful that he can remove his chain. In effect, he must remain at his post, yet knows not fully why. And, accordingly, it seems that this very theory is the point by which his natural completion can profess, for he can at best self-reflect upon himself as the subject he is, and how within such limits he should bind.
    <br>&emsp;This, to be clear, is banked on the pure notion that besides an ultimate measure, things that appear different may in fact not be so, but warrant -in effect by those subjecting them- their distinction, or at the very least contrasting them in that they appear unique. Or, better said, that however short our knowledge goes, the identities of what appear to be separate entities can at least hold fair measures of those being separate. “The point being, that as subjects they may differ, and thus in our regard.”
    <br>&emsp;In front of this though sits our place as man, which is to say that how we would be identified, is how we ought to amend. That is indeed our furthest struggle, for despite our great wealth of both material and sense, so are there scars from our tracks behind. In this I fear that we have not reached a point worth guessing from, for we know not where but must act with the limited power we have; yet, on route to acquiring that power, we were pre-mature (and with haste) to identify what our ends were truly for. The problem, is that, for one, we were not actually at a point where rest should be taken and definitions found. Instead, the mere novelty of the wheel should have been respected, and what sense we applied in coloring the world ought to have been kept, reservedly we’ll say, for the more fairly expected advance beyond this point. For if God and his relation to men had not been rooted in until formal writing was a thing, then at least those keen to propose would likely have both humble ends, as their words could say so much more that they couldn’t help but be, but also a measure against, for others could write too, where instead, as it stands, deliberate words and language came after heresy was common. I fear then that our place as realized men is not one which can truly rest in its place, but still holds dear to its roots of salvation. “Yet, in my mind, what choice has ever been well, for lasting effects that is, when under pressure, as opposed to a state which was clear-minded and secure? For in one your running, while in the other your more curious to actual know, and thus commissioned to truly discover, while whatever relieves the former would do.”
    <br>&emsp;I must say though, personally, that this point in time where such primitive ends hold no sway, brings with it the opportunity to incite real amends. That is, the world has overburdened itself with wealth and ability, so much so that the reign of those with ancient sensibility holds no more. “For none can really prove or hold council that Jews should be killed, or HIV ceded to ignorance.” As it were though, the world is changing, but to where it does not know, for again, no end beyond that from times past has been given. And what I am saying is that we should at least act with some sort of end, even if the basis for it is limited. It’s not even a hunch that were going on, but rather a reverence for the truth born from a model which seems fair to respect, within our limits at least. Again, that portrait is one where, beyond the realms of absolute, we can appreciate and respect things as they are identified. For instance, what spice is and how it came to be, generally even, warrants me -despite lacking that knowledge- the integrity to respect that savory is different. Such tastes, or at least what we call taste, are mere properties we hold, as a fish oxygenates itself through gills and, in a granular sense, how molecules form to begin with and over finer configurations behave. We know not where ‘something’ came from, nor do its many wonderments have true models on our behalf. But, we can still deem ourselves as rational creatures, right to flee fire, and sound to use words and industry to create agriculture -that is, we remarked how the light in the sky comes and goes, and the plants with it, then tried something, from compulsion admittedly by our industrial sense, but not to dissimilar than our contrasting aversion to heat, and our equally natural response.
    <br>&emsp;With that in mind we’ve come to our most delicate part. Simply, and perhaps to a further conclusive end, are our sensible parts -or mental products rather- and whether they are in fact tapping into and receiving something, or are the outputs of matter, or tissue in our case? In other words, is there some ethereal form by which the elements of a rock come from, whereby they exist via the expression of that eternity, but peculiarly so in the essence of a rock? I would say no, or at least I wouldn’t describe the heart of this with specifics. That being so though, removes the exemption of reason and sense as being definitively ‘given’ by that eternity. If true, then there were no words in your head but the speech in which you otherwise speak, nor would the sound of a bird be any different than that ear knawing ring (or tune rather): the only difference being of the actual sound or resonance, ‘which, as it were, is held quite fairly by the evident movement of your mouth when you try and think something out, or something like that of the sort’. To be clear, the assessment of your thoughts is mightily hard, especially if it is from outside the person in question. But we need not invite explanations that fit to things which are unlabeled, for doing so makes such explanations rather poor, as they are not even pure in what they are of; moreso, if we did in fact label the subject in question, which is to say your inner thoughts, sounds and what not -your mind if you will, which your actual vision and smell don’t apply- then we’d more aptly find that neurology, acoustics and the comparison to more firmly understood hearing and speech, fits as either an explanation or, at least, grounds for illustrating the natural phenomena at play. Accordingly, if our mind is natural, there mustn’t be anything else which we hold near and dear within the realm of subjects; that is, as a rock whithers, so do we and our minds. And the point is not what we particularly do, but, more importantly, that we as subjects (and in a way all others too) rest and act as things of a material sort; or, better said, that our ‘natures’ are such that they don’t operate elusively and on whims, but by the currents of whatever reality is. And again, we know not where those roots mean for us to go, where they come from, or what they are fundamentally made of: but we do know what an apple is, and where and when it will and could fall from a tree.

 <div id="darkwaters">
    On the whole of it, our fortune and joy bear the regard. The latter though fairs a necessary conduct of self awareness and intention, while the former is more readily marked in the inherited goods already given. Still, this point of our position is one that alters by our own actions, or at least bends based on how we handle the pole. I would just simply remember that you have more than enough, and that anything aimed at improving this is ill-warranted for the purposes of either A) removing idleness, or B) advancing towards things which are both less rewarding and more challenging than you would expect. “You may cross the road to earn a favor, but not the world. For in one, the day is truly given, for your dedication was only a part of it, but if your life is bent towards the gain of something larger, then so will its offer come at the cost of an occupied vessel.” Otherwise, joy seems easy and splendid, abundant too. However, our disregard and or disheveling of fortune (and her sweeter pursuits) keeps me out of sight from other people; holding the according amount of friends is no trouble, but finding friendship, or comrades at least, is not easy in its own right -which can cause a sense of lacking. Still, we are missing only a brief amount of genuine things as compared to a world of occasions. Our path is not even void from such purer developments, but so are we on our own in approach. Perhaps the problem is that our concern for joy holds no room or stay down the paths to fortune. It’s not as if we are displeased ourself, so we ought be amiable, nor are we ignorant of what is required to earn what we plainly need, so we’re rightly stated, but of those routes which stretch beyond the norms of real living -along with the compliments which come about- that is where we lack heading. And I hold no judgment or discrimination, but such activities of relief and ambitious content, are contrary to our own use and devotion to personal growth and fecundity. “Yet the favors from such path are not had, at least on those run farther out.”
    <br>&emsp;None of this is even meagerly botherso me though. Feeling great and strong is hard to offend, nor is anything short of that worth missing out on. And otherwise, those who go that way are not worth any envy, or a receipt of contempt. “Those truly prospering would likely be more discrete and integral, evidently at least; more than that, would any goods that we’d see as worth admiring for and thus emulation be fair to address and regard, as opposed to those sparking down their road of fortune with triumph and pretense.” There is no real victory there. And like a soldier who earns the revere from his bravery, or his own pleasure in being courageous, so is this a mark for those smaller to reach, or those higher to commend. “Only that which is poor earns real envy, as in the hearts of the wicked or on the outskirts of our tranquil mind, so is it those who are crude and bare in their actions -and how much they show this- that such comparisons and contempt are drawn: while those truly good foster no jealousy.”
    <br>&emsp;Further than that, you could point out that one may doubt another based on their disbelief that such goodness is actually not present, and that the colors of vice are in fact at hand; in this case, their understandable envy is in uproar, as another’s apparent place in more admirable tidings is infuriating as the truth in the matter feels hollow, and thus the perceived vice at hand better warrants the envy that the critic has. “Why are you pretending! I know your a fool, but at least stand as so; for in my own aims, I feel a compliment to you, as our similar vows for women and prestige earn us a suitable relationship of real envy and contempt; acting like your not dressed in such ways however, warrants my respect for you, yet in the background I know your toes are dipped in those vicious waters, like I, and thus I am in conflict: for the shame I see, and know, is in we.”

    Often, when I am listening to music or watching shows especially, I have this warm and full feeling. This is what I wish to experienece; and consequently, the breadth of such ways is how we are going to proceed. For in our doubts, we question how our insecurities will be filled, for how can we achieve their remissions with direct efforts towards that? Well, this is mere childs play, were already made. And in a sort, our best is in taking that whole hearted gait, and spreading it as you see fit. But this is the reward, for nothing other is truly a figure of you doing well. And the sprouting of our truest way is more akin to light blooming from a fiery source, rather than a surface being made. "For me, it seems fair that so long as we have that flame, we are well; and because nature has no fundemental claim besides the pressue which our incoerecne leaves with idleness, so are successfull already if we have that flame; for we would be doing as we should if we did not have it, and if having so, we are almost evidently fine: but so can our purpose be in breathing more air into the fire, and spreading the blaze." In other words, the shine around remarks the true reward of the center, and is not aimed at furthering that, but making what is there (already) pleased.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, our life may be reflected on, as in the case for a looming problem. For if we are in fact free and moving, then our thoughts will further reinforce that, but in an expansive way as compared to one of discpline. This is a quick but important distinction, as we are not trying to make our interests ingrained with us, but rather giving such tasks the time and care as to let their natural pace substantiated, rather than present at all. For, if we are free, then ought the things we normally do be fine enough? And if so, then we in effect need only to carve out a better path, or reflect on what would support us in activity while we proceed. This, to be clear, is a remark set within the effects of gluttony, whereby we come to a relaxed but stationary stance; and in those cases, we tend to think of what we are going to do, and further that notion with something akin to a promise, as to give us momentary relief -both by virtue of the permission to remain relaxed, but also in remedying the stationary symptom of long term frailty.
    <br>&emsp;What I have noticed, is that when our actions in fact don't come to play, that this is not a limit of the actions and our discipline to them. Instead, the situation is one where we in fact lack freedom. This is so, perhaps, in that our time is hedged elswhere, or grogged down lets say. More importantly, the norms of our lives if left unaccounted for, may rear their heads with interam conseuqneces. For example, when we were younger we would have this large stretches of great and happy time, but as it went on we found out that we had been poorly accounting for how we cumminacated with our mom and dad; in effect, we were thrown off of our stance and forced to deal with the lack of respect and adherence I was giving. In doing so however, we were able to mend that gap and secure it tightly for the future to come. In a way, these sort of issues reveal themselves as their shortcomings accrue. This is in contrast to immediate tasks such as work or health, while these are ones that come about after months, if not years. And like most things, the knot on the strand must become reinforced for it to stay without our attention. I do in fact disregard how I treat my parents for my natural bent has angled itself towards treating them well; this was not my nature though and thus practice to begin, and both an understanding and continuous reflection was required. That being said, it is clear that even the elements which are most near, may in fact be slipping, or lacking firmness and ease. Consequently, as I experience it anyway, that I may be aware of something needing my regard, but as the essence of it looses any active hold, then so does it become bundled up, whereby it resorts to pinning from some far recess in my mind. "As if I know, having accepted, but through ill attention it recedes, acting then as a orbiting weigtht, rather than one where my more capable tenants can hold." This, along with the tears from pure neglect, remark how the strands of our common lives can tangle us up and hurry us down. And as I see it, there are things at the moment which are lacking do to our current lethargy; even more though, am I noticing (as if the kind was just realized) that there is debirs in my field of orbit, which in other words means that there are aspects of my life which are not fully accounted for. And perhaps in some cases I know, but have given them little regard; and so as they become more evident, or at least like dark matter make their appearence indirectly noticible, their weight begins, for as I said the lever of my distant mind is fragile and burdensome when compared to the pipes of deliberation and reason. 
    <br>&emsp;Worth noting, is that our lack of enjoyment comes from the normal weight of the world; for even with the clearest sight, do we still have to hold. It is true though that regularity and development make things which were once a struggle, easier. Still, even if things of the past weigh us little, so is the awareness that is still required subject to the throbbings of those negging strands. And otherwise, my point is that whether there is a weight which is known, or some overlooked issue that still burns in its effects (from it being passed by), so are we in a state or not of equilibrium, which by my account yeilds us an experience surrounding that levered support. That is to say, that whether we are burdened by our tasks -due to its weight and our lackings, or its unknown but felt effects- or are floating with nearly any effort, so are we living outside this. In other words, life pressures us, be it immediately or of those looming things in orbit, but so are we with activity and response if the trouble is gone. Whether were relaxing or in some self directed activity, were alive. And the point, is that seeing as the mightiest reward is akin to the latter, reaching its height through flavor, regularity and ease, so is the limit of this based on those weighing forces. For instance, if we have no danger holding our attention, then our gazing nature will turn to the sun and stars. And so does this become easier when we do it more often, for we may see more than we had before, and newly as well. Disregarding this aim though, let us simply accept our shortcomings within it are due to issues within those groundfloor tasks. Now, much of this is out of control, as nature needs us to be either resourcefull or co-operative in acquiring food and shelter. But still, even if this is easily come by, so are many elements possibly being overlooked. This is why I bring up those orbiting pieces of debris; for we know that if we miss work that there will be trouble, and that even though it is work in being employed, that constant use of that task will render it more simple, wherein the effect is at least an increase in our ability to experience that fuller aim. Yet, we may be unaware of draining interest from unacknowledged debts. Again, someone who is truly misfortuned may not be able to make a profit, or a comparabily high one as those who simply work a part time job; but at least in these cases the struggles are upfront and in hand, which to reiterate places the burden with our most capable aspects. I would still make note, that the relationship one has with their parents ontop of their more rural fortunes, is still in effect a debt; for even if one is bracing the force of those downward troubles, so is the inflammation regarding their family an ostensible thorn in their side. For, the point perhaps overall is that even in our richest ways, we are still in doubt; for locally, we as a culture are still young when it comes to our views of truly profitable duty and health, while even those pure in those respects, may be poor in their assortment of words, which is to say that despite their locally sound assembly, that rought shores swirl ahead (and around), or that toxins have spilled in some outflow far away, and are rotting the nearby soil from deep below. And to me, the aim of saint like riches is unachievable while this is happening. For just as it is hard to pay of a credit card while the interest is so, so is it hard to be at the top when the graspable struggles have cracks seizing you from behind. 
    <br>&emsp;And in short, that little kid in India who runs around in the rubble and mud, is not just absent from the privilages of a comforting time, but so are they over the course of months and years suceptible to the same woes which even the wealthiest are subject to in their own stable time. It is true, in a way, that in lower classes that people are perhaps less vain, and in a general sense operate with more regard (or attention at least) to their family. And in that sense, the pair of humility and communal kindness can in fact afford one a lower burn rate, in contrast say to those of a higher but realtivelty ignorant class when it comes to those deeper strands of our common lives. Better said, those in less fortuned scenarios deal with the struggle of getting bread and bed, but by their ordinary and unfutile characters remove, or at least contain little debris around them; while, in summary, those in chambers of gold and glorious red, may in fact have snakes in the garden, or even skeletons in their closet. "For is that not the case for all of Man, that what truly matters, be it near and dear or passively orbiting, if poorly treated will accumulate, like a debt, and cause such a decrease in our living."
    <br>&emsp;I stand personally then, as one without anything less than privilage, but a rot if you will, in all those unaccounted things around melting away my sides. I must suggest however, that just as skills for a house league are little, so are those of the highest kind neccessary of an equal calibre. And in my case, that rich experience of reliance and direction, promulgation and serenity, comes only when my makeup is pure. Weidly enough, I am noticing things which have always been there, only now when feeling good is a given by effect of attending to certain things, are those missing elements which hold greatness from being equally so more prominent and clear, 'like debris orbiting around me which held little regard in comparison to the nearer storms around'. And in a way, to conclude, Plutarch is right in his remarks, where he suggests, 'that those in the field of sculpting (with clay) have the hardest job when fingertips are involved'.

    We require nothing for this common life. True, we could see more of it if we had success, but such ends require their own heft of efforts. “And our delights found in liberty, require an equal amount for themselves.” Admittedly there is stuff I’d like to do, but our interest in doing roots itself in the fear of missing out, or at least the chance that a more thrilling life could be acquired. “That’s what seeing all these people with their accolades and plaques does to me; why aren’t we with such claims, or better yet why is our road not down that path?” For a good life, all it takes is regality and true regard. For that, the world we have is enough, and your home bears that mark.
    <br>&emsp;A stronger way of describing this, is that our flourishing reflects the warmth around our localle; while success remarks the expansion of the latter. This is unrequired, as it is the movement of the former which is really desired. Moreover, can it be experienced wherever you are. Conclusively then, we will not heed contempt or feel ashamed, or be rightfully driven or yearning for a life which is growing, thrilling, glorious or acclaimed -in an outward direction that is. These require so much more than our good life is willing to barter, as it too demands that we throw ourselves in; the difference being one of conquest and play. “Its as if we held an telescope, looked at the stars and chartered our findings, settled on them, looked forward to future findings, and all about our ordinary claim, while the other marks a plan, a vision, some preview, as if we’re going somewhere, better mind you, with all the praise and profession as our dreams defined. This is ill-founded, unnecessary, keenly placed, and worth no contrary amount of shame.”

 <div id="atlas">
    Something I’ve always known is that everyone lives their own respective lives. And because mine is different, I feel under threat.
    <br>&emsp;This is so, primarily, because our aims are different, as are our thoughts on what should be worked for, or not even. Through such bends, the angle of others sheens against mine; for when their telling stories about their fruits and promise, I fear a suggestion coming towards me. This is so for I would have to explain why I was uninterested, even if the venture was strong. For as I see it, reproach is not a measure of interest, but priority rather. Of course I’d like to be the King of England, and of course I’d like to take that trip, but in and of itself I am less intrigued than I am to read, or write, study and run. Better yet, if there were good in those fortunes, it would be so those latter had a nicer area to partake in; yet, this would be a fortune indeed, as it were likely given; whereas the privilege’s that are acquired, however scrumptious in their lining, heed no short amount of difficulty in their acquisition. “And I take the lane which holds what’s near and dear: that is primary.”
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps we are trying to have our cake and eat it to. It may be true that others, in all their differences, and possibly unfriendly from them, see my own differences not as poor, but without room for contradiction. For I cannot live so simply but ask for something. Nor can I refrain from the linens of what’s common, yet still expect someone to stand by me. This is the struggle though, for however well you shine, your still Atlas holding the ball. Others may warm you, and you may warm them, but always in a moving state. “For I will not be theirs, nor will they be mine.” And the truth in that is what is hard for me to be, and as such is where there’s friction in what would set me free. For we are not looking for benefits here when in fact there would be shortcomings there; but rather we are looking for strength and fruitfulness from ourself, be it alone, with others or an attractive kind -as in those brought to your shine and aid. ///////
    <br>&emsp;Where I struggle is in telling someone that they care, but that they will never be mine; so love is all they’ll receive, but no proceeds towards their position to greet it. Nor will I be theirs, by which our own efforts see no need to append, for their stake is not one being asked for. Its strange isn’t it, to an end which holds no par for possibility. For the gains we seek are in need of prioritization; yet, wisdom can define, and with this context in mind, I only mean to say that love is all I seek, in treatment and receipts. But under no impression am I to believe that some other will be mine, nor I theirs. “For what life is, is better rustic in the fullest state, as compared to a line which brings you together, but hollow. ”

 <div id="movement">
    Since we will always be moving, concern for fortune outside of this regard seems unimportant. And as it were, our life will more or less be contained within a constant set of rungs, those being the nature of our limit, the position of self regard, family and friends, and our true reward flowering from this -of leisure and industry that is. If we are alive, so will these elements be tightly knit together. Considering our need to move, our liberality will be deemed so if such movements are able to proceed unhindered. Fortune, to be clear, is that which removes our stakes, or at least we temper the flame behind us (which makes us move, and in accordance tailors our actions to have ends). This is not worth removing from your life, but threat of its remission are not truly worth humoring; for, as we said, even in chains we can hold our self with divine regard; and seeing as our country is one of humanity and law, so are our ordinary ways protected from all but our own villany in being persecuted. Stealing in a plagarized sense is not too uncommon, nor is there any abscence of dogmatic scrutiny or harm; but so are we able to be kind, and in a practical sense angle ourselves to future times and current places which are in fact relevant to us: as opposed to those public fantasies -where such critques linger. Our life only needs to put out there, but this is merely local, and at best attractive to those who would then share in establishing community. This is our lane though, of which others may care, as I do. “Manchester won, and I was the player who scored; but me and the fans were equally set and ordained to the team winning.” So those who care about gaming, literature, film and the world, will be comrades of mine through interest, and I to them -no matter who is the one running the play.
    <br>&emsp;In sincerity, the only downfall of our living times, is that if we have come from activities and their effects born through complacency and foolish ignorance, then our return to a better state will see us falling forward, as if the tears from the prior efforts made us lose our grace. In effect, our uprigthness is too stiff and we either settle into the disposition of those vicous things -whereby we are nothing- or we (as mentioned) return to a better state, of action, but carry the weight of vice’s baggage. Thus, stiffness is brought to our actions, despite their sincere attempt. Disposition though can iron this out, as can principle act as a firm molder of such transition. #####Instead of saying that commitment is required as to stay down this better lane, we can simply rest on the notice we have of action’s precedent, which is to say that we will always be doing so, and thus removing concern for fortune -as our liberty is all we need- or interest for relaxtion -for it is a monstrous alternative to rest, as one is fully stopped, while the other is merely slowed down.

 <div id="oldscars">
    In times of doubt or contrition, affirming your course is key. For, I do wish to be on the same page as those around me, for the weight placed on me ceases somewhat, as the stakes at least are not so much. For now, I see that we are asked very little, not understood to be doing something of any contrary way, and that the sole limit is actually our aim of action. In that, we should define.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, I seek community, production, friendship, and care. This though, is a mark of our innate humanity, for if we were able to flourish on our own, then such an experience would be no less hospitable. None the less, the demands of me, or at least the constancy of our regard, entrenches a desire for things which relieve it, or allow us to respond no less. In that sense, the purpose of our survival is one that makes such efforts meaningful, for even in this modern time where failure is all but absent, so are we kept at that post, meandering: and purpose, or liberty rather, makes such stilled yet fortuned positions fulfilling.
    <br>&emsp;I will admit that in these troubled ways, or at least in our past when such weights were not held with the vigor and skill we have currently, I dreamt of both the remission or succession of misfortune, or duty rather. This, again, is not so much a crucial error; but, the saturation of it now, at least as it reflects the stain made by those prior whims, leaves our current clarity with a bit of loopy colors. However, as I will in summary denote, is that due to such muffledness, some affirmativeness of what is good is needed. For in doing so, as has been, the nievety washes away and its longing recedes, while the grip of what is solid and sound furthers with a purifying grace, whereby our past is sweetly incorporated, the present is stout, and the future is richened and light in its anticipation and austerity.
    <br>&emsp;We simply have much to say. Regarding the old world and new, its contents both crafty and great, and our views, or at least pleasures born for expression, all together segmented by pieces but of a wholesome bloom. The means to share, or connect we’ll say, is open and free; moreso, does the language used in such medium reflect that piece like interest of treatnent. And although I care not how much I am heralded or appraised, the production of fitting things, or respect for the tailored design of the medium, is of and through the kind of work we do itself. “For example, if I saw the moon and wished to write a set of verse, then posting it to a foreign platform without adapting the initial language to be suitably fitted would be an empty pursuit. Whereas, in Youtube’s case, there are thumbnails, or image headers we’ll say, and ignoring this is a contrary move to the videos in question; yet, of what thumbnail I do, that can itself be a mark of the work itself, as my otherwise primary effort is in tributing the content through writing: so can my subject then be reflected in the header.” Knowledge then of what is right and wrong in sharing, is of the form it takes, which, in short, is best summarized by spreading a message while adjusting the language its expressed in. Plus, all of this is centered on the fact, though I must admitt a frankness to our limit, that from me there is this communal push, or religious sentiment of sharing original views on things, or at least pointing out things which others do not see. “In this outward aim though, sits a man already at peace with himself. And perhaps, at most, his motions outside, are mere responses to the natural shifting of his place in the world: whereby he holds the sun in sight, with the world on his shoulders; and his move to include others, is but a normal activity of the man in question.”
    <br>&emsp;That, is all I see, and I rest within those norms as not to guarantee or malign our wish to be received moving forward; but we can perform our natural bounds, as we would in speaking politely while out in public, so could the basic gesture of sharing our name compare to the generous portions born of our hand. “For my name, is a marker of someone and thus what they do; for they who perfomed that action, so is there name a link to that; but whereas you may admitt your name upon being seen in motion, so can the presumed assembly of you bear a less assumed action; that is, we know not what our name would be, but through it we identify the person who has achieved the evidence of an action had; while otherwise, we know that all men -who we can see as the they appear- have all of a mind, heart, feet and hands, yet to where or how they go, we do not know: and the fruits of intelligence are not in need of an uncovering because those around us could not, and do not already know that we have the tools and means to do so: but rather, unlike artists and officials, our outputs are of words and ideas, whos sprouting is but an invincibly thin sheathe, home to the cheeriest of air.” And like a new game, the rules must be given; and so too in this morphing array of wisdom’s contents, so must we be able to describe what it is that one might be seeing.

 <div id="idlecontempt">
    The winds of winter are coming, yet of their coolness I am ready to be pleased. For once in our life, we are no longer cyclical; that is, the cold months are no end, in that they’d approach the beginning reach of spring onto summer; but rather, this year’s end leads into next years beginning, but so are they only subequent months. There is no reset.
    <br>&emsp;I have noticed that as we string along though, or at least when our sleep and lack of profession unsettle me to see how others are moving, or going somewhere at least, we see that we are not. It is true that philosophy offers a true spark for optimism, as all is treated well, be it through fortitude or gratitude, yet when our mind is dull or our bodies are poor, neither the excitement for what we’d see is quite clear or known, or the actual anticipation of our life moving down that way. “For what else might we see, or become?”
    <br>&emsp;It seems we have reached a starting point for real living, one of which has real footing on the bedrock of maturity. As I noticed prior to this though, the harshest truths reveal their wares when errors are made. “As if our executive nature revealed more strict consequences from our errors.” These are merely trimmings, and admittedly sometimes roots, of previous feelings and thoughts regarding the world (and its people) that arise within our life, as their seriousness draws comparably severe criticism. That is, as our life becomes more consuming, so do its slips reveal more serious cracks. “Why hasnt this been given regard, or when you were pre-occupied and feeling self important, the perceived movement of others did not bother you?” Now, when our view of things hasnt flattened into a normalized view by which others either vainly or to their righteous end run, so are we rocked by our lack of movement. Or in other words, others appear to be moving because we have not seen what real movement is. As it were, our yearning for home and wonder, makes others appear as if they have, and we feel inferior. As we shed that longing nature and instill more forward and steady steps, so do others appear less so, for their lack of such footing has no envy or insecurity to latch onto, or any hidden truth to its frailty; morover, their proper advance -in which they’d truly benefit- is agreeable to me. Perhaps the example of one who is frustrated with themselves and thus becomes irritated at others flawed success, warrants relevance.
    <br>&emsp;What we are trying to remove is this feeling that we are still, and by virtue of others lauded progress and or movement, that we are wrong to be in our current state, and should thus proceed. Normally, our happiness in being still yet engaged recognizes any of the criticsim; but when we make mistakes, or are even fully worked, we notice and or feel shame and contempt for not moving. One thing to point out, is that our preferred and or ready state is not banked towards or set for novel gains or occupation. In that sense, our sincere state of activity cares not that such ends are lacking, and as such warrants no scolding if their abscence is so. What is most important is that our personal route can be proceeded upon with absolute regard for it as a path; as opposed to worrying (and receiving judgment) that it is deeply wrong, the actual success of the way itself is whats to be regarded. As it were, the right path is determined by reason, which finds itself bringing universal qualities and our personal nature together. Simply, the ends of any path are such that ease of access, regularity and flavor determine its worth. Per our case, our lives are situated around death, friendship, self regard and wonder, to which a respect for that and our treatment from it, will heavily lean us towards the ends and preference of well being, as compared to ends which are baked within being well off. “For what King would not be declared the best, if he werent the happiest and freest, by which we mean that restless fears and spite combined with sulking pleasure and unconstant joy, were more often than not absent: whereby we’d stamp the heart of his reign.”

 <div id="fruitsoffreedom">
    Life is a little strange now adays. As it stands, we are no longer trying to acquire anything; that is, our efforts and or creations are not bent or regarded on anything they may or may not acquire. So, our own concerns are placed on the things themselves, ‘as if joy and the pace of our day was actually the measure’. By that token, our considerations are bent towards what we are actually going to do. Whats weird though is that our intent is not reflective of going somewhere. Rather, the extent to which the work is completed holds our regard. In that sense, our reflections about our time bear no credible concern on ‘where were going’, as if by them (meaning our action) that somewhere we should go -or be so as a return. Instead, the work is beholdened itself, be it through writing and industry, film and other leisure, or our own training and fitness. The question simply is how these are being attended to, and wherein ‘they’ will go -as compared to our fortune.
    <br>&emsp;You see our life is fine being ordinary, for having anything more earns one nothing if the elements rooted in the former are untended to. At any rate we are trying to live great lives, but this is not about a change in scenery or fashion, but how we actually spend our time. In a word, our liberal activities are those that come from such freedom, whereby the difference is that these are activities which we throw ourselves into, while those others are about reaching some place or bit of scenery that does everything for you. And to reiterate, bolder and or more substantial claims of official and or public workings, serve only to fixate one, and likely from an unsturdy ground. “Merely worry about yourself, your friends, your family, and tell me if your constance there reveals any need or suitable value in ruling the world, or serving a king?”
    <br>&emsp;These greens are from being ourselves, which is both necessary in either liberality or ambition, but so is that former fine and plenty when such conditions are met. And, perhaps, the most important strand of philosophy is that such fruits of freedom (liberty) are in no short order of needed attention, for they may require skills or formation themselves and otherwise neccessarily call on you to particpate: for happily, that is the reason for their worth to begin, for you can pleasingly act. And so in a forward sense, I am free to live meagerly and fine, while flourishing via that liberal load. Our growth here will be at most gradual, and any of its impact and status will result from our natural presence (of constancy in the front and back of these things), to which our brightness will iteratively grow. “And the mark of a man is in being fine with that.”

 <div id="theheatwithin">
    I don’t think I’d ever want a friend, at least I wouldn’t seek one that wasn’t into me. That is so because my interests are of a peculiar sort. I sit on the floor, and sleep there too mind you; I care little for excursions, nor do I regard occasions as pleasing. I text little, chat not, and my time elsewhere is either creative and leisurely indoors, or actively flaunting or gazing outdoors. There is room for nothing other. It is true that this life holds the according prompts of lacking people, but as I’ve found you can be a steady friend to yourself. This is a quaint idea, but isn’t most of our time so already? When you sleep, as you wake, while your fiddling with something, bathing, taking care of your self, or reading for instance. And I find that it is only when these things come poorly together that I seek something more, as if my time hadn’t been good till this point and something exciting was further sought. In fact, I shed off ancillary efforts and engage in those as I am either deemed, or those which are sought. And in doing so, the floor beneath me feels sturdy enough, for in my activity I am really engaged, and otherwise happy to strengthen. And so by those accounts I am never alone nor lacking warmth, even in what would otherwise be overlooked as fortune. For I have the company of my Mom and Dad, am on the beach of life with all people and or our community, as am I entrenched in the personal writings and letters of old, who like Christ and God give me a cheerful friend.
    <br>&emsp;By my accounts a friend would deplete this, at least as I think about having one I think of all the contrary currents to those which I have mentioned. What is natural need not be coined as it comes together with near passivity. But in terms of what I can address and thus amend to, it is not the warmth of another, but the flame we have inside. For in that, it is a bonfire, tended by me and used in our activity. While the heat from others seems somewhat smaller, over time at least - through the day especially, depsite its deeper moments. Because my aim is to move, I need a lasting resonance, rather than a stilled pace furnished by bright spots. “And only those fitting and in line with that could be a friend for me: otherwise, I am fine with the one I have in myself, for in it, our flame is raised.”

    A simple fact is that most things require little. We may have to work more than we’d like to achieve them, or are otherwise limited in the extent of which our actions could acquire, but stability through adjustment will occur. As it were, I could take 6 months of relatively inexpensive training to become an instructor or worker of sorts; this would increase our rate of income, and likely the form of it -an alternative at least.
    <br>&emsp;Unpacking this though, I have other interests and priorities. In effect, I have both no time to committ to learning something other, nor do I wish to partake in its tasks at the expense of our own work. Labor affords this, as the time is comparably sparse and non mental; moreso does it contribute some vigor (and means to rest). Working as a programmer on the other hand, is similar in work as my own, and I mean not to compromise -at least I recognize there is one. Moreover, the real gems of that pursuit take more than early developments; those permit an increase in income, but not neccessarily the dynamics of work that you’d seek. However short, there is surely more time required for that novel aim (of mobility and self living) to be met: and currently I have not the time nor interest to foster that.
    <br>&emsp;That being said, if I were, for argument’s sake, finished with our creative work, then our means for allocation could be directed to some other pursuit. Whether I’d want this or not is unclear, but not worth regarding. If I am rightfully happy, then things clear out. Only, right now, I do wish for more footing in the land around; but acquiring so within deliberate means, is both too demanding and, admittedly, undesired enough by me in this moment, to slice off some of our dearest effort’s attention.
    <br>&emsp;I say this for I believe that down this line we will be happy. For me it is worth anticipating the fact that to meet our needs, we’d do little. Even if circumstance has us doing a bit more, so does the nature of the job apply, for if it is just a bit more effort but of a supporting kind (of our creativity that is), then so be it. I fret not that this will change or that via lifes coming course, that we cannot discount our time without consequence. The future beyond this interests me too little; and the present possibilities are such, that they are worse if we have to work at all: but the merrits are still fine, and stabilitiy can more or less increase in the ease by which its achieved. Personally then, I feel as though our regard is set, and that we can rest on our actual activity, and accept where were obliged, and waiver not on whether or not we will or will not recieve. Let the road which scares me little, come as it be; for in our proceed, we are already made -which holds nothing more than the mantle below.

 <div id="windingaims">
    I know, however small, that clearcut effort will always win the day. What is interesting though, is that when you reach a sincere point of adulthood, you earn less reward, or value in other words, for simply showing up. Better said, your results and the actions which afford them are what mark you actually being fufilled and content. For in your adolescent days -which we’ll describe as those where trying was the game- our idea of the good was less formed, and thus we had a shorter bar to cover before completion was reached. And because our standards were evidently low, so could we reach them with more whimsy and gusto, whereby the care and regard for being as so, settled as the valued element.
    <br>&emsp;Now, on the other hand, our interest is one of true and constant success, and as such calls on us to be more than merely well intended, but actually efficient. Another way of looking at it is that ends call on both an aim (or intent) and a target (ie. as a magnifier for precision); and in effect, our accuracy in reaching forward will be as much as such paths are met. The thing is, that upon our adulthood those routes (and their corresponding course) became set within lanes of real and lasting substance; whereas in our developing years, the mere sheathe of greatness was enough to remedy our day: while in our fully formed state, that quality is equal through both flesh and the bone -or activity rather, as opposed to mere attempts.

 <div id="engenderedpost">
    So there are two things that come to mind when I am thinking about my life. First, is what will fulfill you, in that it seems important, substantial or meaningful. Second, is what soothes your core; or in other words, what do you like, enjoy, commend, emulate, rest with, accept or wish to routinely do? These two sentiments of our place in life and what strikes our heart, mark our path of refinement.
    <br>&emsp;Of note, is that I seek some fidelity in this thought. For positions and or destinations may seem attractive, but after thinking on it and what it would actually mean, I realize that such (or at least most) things of this kind fair little once the moment is done. Or, better said, that the reason I strive for such ends, or at least why I am choosing them right now, is that they stand as things appropriate for the caseOur lacking, idle intent. Yet, in my mind, which I must admit has been reflected on greatly, there’s little care or intrigue to things that, upon definition, come out as mere occasions or frivolity. “In short, I wish not to bank my life or time on novelty.”
    <br>&emsp;So what does seem important? Well, helping the world sticks out, or offering any kind of service for that matter. Education, entertainment, civilities, etc., come to mind, as do inventions and theories which profess to improve our lives. Here though a core thread wriggles its truthful head, in that all of these things, whose aims I think across the board we share, appear to me, or at least have as this little thread has poked its way into my life over the years, that saving the world, being a hero, discovering things or merely becoming profound, is really a reflection of our otherwise idle aimlessness, and that as these things appear much larger than ourselves, so do our objective seeking minds attend. Yet, the truth in these is in no ways evident; that is, when it comes to our purpose in all of this, rather than the actual merrit or claim of the world being saved or an invention brought forth. Who says these are what your meant to or interested in doing? From my experience, there is an apparent lack of self-regard and reflection, which is to say that we already have a purpose at hand; it is not out there in the world or under the spotlight, but local to what we’ve known our entire lives; friends, family, leisure, death, there’s already a slew of things that deserve more candid and effective attention.
    <br>&emsp;So, asking whether you should make an impact, forge a path for a family, explore distant lands or introduce reverred papers, pings you as unjust, for what maintenance can you afford to those deeds which are already provided; better yet, which of those deeds have you even tailored to an effortless prosperity? For if there is room to go, why not address it: won’t their be purpose in that? We already find -and in some ways feel- that being married, employed and a parent will give purpose to our lives, but consider why and that this is so because they are obligations which seem worthwhile to attend; but do you not have those already, ignored or merely neglected? When have there been words on your mind until this time, when you even asked what we already have to do? “As a citizen even or person of the world, is there not even worth in being decent and sincere, as to look highly of others and, at the very least, not be put off by their inferiorities or irritations? Who do you know who is so pleasently arranged around all people; or are they always shouting criticisms and miserries, as if their misfortuned to be subject to such stupidity? Has this person really upheld their post, as a person, or have they let themselves go in a way, as reflected in their quick-tempered negativity and pessimism?” Better yet, don’t those people just know it all? “Let me tell you,” they’ll say!
    <br>&emsp;So, personally, I find my purpose, or place rather, is in virtue. For our limits as man and death via our mortality, surrounds me and, as it appears, bounds through all. So just by that am I subject to a deed of importance wherever I go. Moreso, be it in close quarters and the needed conduct, or when I am off and about and must be faithful (and considerate), does my family, friends and home need my stead -at least I should remember them, and keep my far-off actions in line.. Even so, in that active wake, must I helm myself, for even if some place is new or some opportunity large, a lack of self-regard or integrity will see that both it and or my use of it whither away. “So not even the furthest resorts and wonders could hold my drunken head, nor could they shine enough to pierce my ignorant heart.”
    <br>&emsp;In short, where I am, where I go, till all my time is up and through the steps between, I must be, fully, dearly, clear. For if I am not, then all things contrary to what I seek will happen; nor, will my actual quest for meaning elsewhere yield me the room I seek to go. “For currently, my post is arranged. And, as it were, as we leave such for another, the debt beneath feels more like chains.” Hence “take me oh yonder, for in this life of misery I seek salvation. All this weight, it tears behind me, and for what I do not know.” It is because you forgot to address it in the first place; and whether on the grander scale or a stormy night, you left your post, ceded, spilled momentum. Moreso, your pleas of that which reflects the highest that divinity could sign, already held you in regards: and what I find strange is that in your hopes you noticed, yet held nothing but pittle in your active wake. “As if death were what grieved you, so you sought a favor, yet, such apprehension is born from your disregard for the place of death which was already there.”
    <br>&emsp;No matter, this is about me, and in their case I understand, while in mine I am at least aware that it is I who doesn’t know -or needs clarity at least. Which, as it stands, marks my ultimate denotion as being set for death, but in a way that I must reach it: as opposed to those who seek removal. “In other words, I submit myself to it as the highest place, or rather, that it is merely a step of enrollment no different (besides being further) than that of our near lives -in family, leisure and friends- or our active ones, in that we’d saturate ourselves through self-regard, rather than sloth and stupidity.” And the most important note, as I get it, is that I am without need -as virtue has disposed me to this- or mistaken that I can ask and or devolve a plan to oust myself from this path, and in other words, that I should or, ultimatley, can, go to another place. “For the one which holds things between it and all, bears no realm to be somewhere other; for now is when I have the time to be, for it is our being that we are so within the place for being; where we then go I do not know, but surely somewhere more absent.”
    <br>&emsp;And so I’ll surrender, as to not want more and through that hopefully receive, and otherwise use the fruits of virtue as positive enforcements to guard against our lack. Nor, will I be ignorant or inconstant through our living time, as doing so would only leave the world heated and in flames; so much so, that what guides me and buries itself in, is not the common parts of life which we are engendered to treat, but passions, fear and lust, which drench our faculties of desire, aversion and interest. Hereby, the otherwise calm and enrichening pace which a solid life brings, will be drought with sulking, putrid, capsizing colors. “Ones which will only make it hard to retreat into our actual selves and accept what our responsibilities and reverence can offer.” Instead, we’ll be on our toes, as if being chased by a fire, but really its just the pain and inflammation from being unable to sit and rest. “In other words, the sparks of restlessness drive us into the mouths of true danger; and otherwise, cede us from resting by the warming flames of virtue and her retreat.”

 <div id="needlessrestraint">
    The simplest definition may be, that character molds our actions, and from that, there comes a lot of reproach. For stealing, frivolity and tradition, hold little regard for someone who is disposed to real goods. But, in that, there may not be so much for you to do, as your aversions outweigh the interests of others.
    <br>&emsp;What I have learned though in my adolescent age, is that what you care for (in a character’d way) needs no shield or explanation to be amidst those of other sorts. You don’t have to change. And although your interest may simply hold you somewhere, private even, it doesn’t mean that others need be avoided.
    <br>&emsp;Then there is this point about seeing great things and struggling to express so amidst those more common. This in a way is the heart of an artist, in that they see the world differently, but cannot express it so clearly, so they paint, write, sing or dance, and in that way solidify their view. What I’ve learned though, is that the purpose of art, albeit liable for inspiration, is not there to improve other’s lives. This is an insecure conjuring, for it gives you control over others in terms of what your doing. For if you see them as not so well, than your grand offerings will shine for them, and make you appear more acceptable, as they are now on board. “All while you really just wanted to fit in, or at least have your view understood -as not to have it unclear and weighing down on you.”
    <br>&emsp;The question then, is what ought you do. For, if there are problems or interests you have, then so will your actions define. But otherwise, you are free and set to do as you please, which again, is not a problem in itself. But, if your missing someone, or bored even because your work is done, then there are places you can go. Yoga or meditation classes, eastern temples, outdoor yoga and gatherings or meetups of sorts. Be reliable in your resourcefulness, and your wish to paint the world as you wish, will have more warmth and support around, and not be so pressed to do so. For the aim of such coloring is in the contentment of your soul, from completing it, signing your way. It is not for the sake of acquiring, or overcoming the suitability to even see so -in that your admitted. This comes from the fact that when your tired and what not, something to do and or the care from people, is wanted. At least you can identify their effects as so. And, if we feel insecure because our sight is different and or large, then that separation causes whimsy, self-importance, shame and reductions. “Just go outside, and try.”

 <div id="theagingpast">
    It seems that the past has transitioned into what seemed so recent. Prior, it felt like our childhood was what sat beneath us: now it is our route to becoming a man, which itself means we are in the process of blossoming as one, as if the frame we tried to build is now calibrated and set for completion: yet, all that effort, which itself came from our younger years, is behind us: and, personally, at least, I see how little this has been incorporated, nor, admittedly, sat upon a fully solid base (of our youth).
    <br>&emsp;It saddens me somewhat that so much has gone on, and that through that, so much is glaringly distant. I just don’t think we entirely know who I am, and thus what I have received, and moreso. The past is catching up to me; and our aims ahead and treats on the horizon, beckon under their unfitted end. And so all that which I now see besides me, feels more apparent in its lack, for we are with not.
    <div class="qu">There is no problem, merely work required. For again, the recent memory is that where we once thought we stood, and it must be taken back, as to solidify the present and that to come. This will remedy any fleeting sense of loss or failure, which has admitteldy been brought on through the longing which comes from that unfettered past</div>
    We were a boy once, and of what kind I don’t exactly know. All I can say was that I was happy, at least things were well along with I. As I grew though, circumstances changed, and what I felt was most dear separated from me; and this alongside with the narrowing freedoms I had, left me more satisfied with biding our time with those: but little life glowed around this. Due to a lack of constance and internal width, the ‘radiation’ so to speak that was meager on the outside, left our life in a state of implosion. I did not seek though what would yield me strength based on where I was going, but who I was rather, which in a way brought stability from the inside, and thus established support from the outside -as I could dance with a it a little more, or address it at least, gathering its shine.
    <br>&emsp;Neverthless, we have come from there, whereby the achievement of retirement was one, ‘for I had everything I needed, regularly’: and the question then was what I would do in that free time. Down this path I’ve come, and the refinement of those treats is now the measure of our frame. As if I were liberated from toil, clarified in our objectives born from freedom, and set for that manifestation. That will be a secure completion, upon which I will offer myself to another, or something at least, meaning I will then give, as I have completed who I am: where in fact, I can give from that mark to such other -a boy perhaps, named Tom- and help them reach the same. Only, in my personal case, this hope, or condition at least, can lead them down this path with immediacy. Whereas I had to reproach from the norms of responsibility, which in themselves reflected a farther point to acquire freedom, I will provide the currents that allow this to happen much earlier, thus allowing for a sooner point of blossoming. And they may hopefully have less rot and knots beneath; which in effect, would nicely sort them into their own offerings from completion, and the refining legacy continues. “We are the first though, perhaps in the true class of man. But I need only be honest, whether in comparison -as to remove faults and winding desires- or with myself, so I can see and cheer at my spot, as I am, how its come so, and whereto and which end.”
    <br>&emsp;The largest spot of remission comes from not being who I am now in that past. Understanding this is so from that origin of reproach. Still, we are in the present, free, honest and open, but not yet having made connection, or much progress for instance. However, I think that despite the warmth that such things bring, it is moreso the fear that was present while these things were around, that leaves us scarred. Whereas now we are keen to move and speak forward, we were not so prior; things of interest would pass us by and we were hesitant, as we were uncomfortable showing who we are. “Having reproach is hard like that, for none really experience the fruits that come from her, or freedom rather. Instead, their more familiar with the treats of relief, or those which marble their advance, as softeners or motivations.” At any rate I felt avoided, or at least separated; this held a cynical mold over me, as I condemned them for our differences; or I felt frustration and shame, as if they were unaware of me, yet did not know why (or, rather, why I was different). That is what deflates me: not our lacking, but being known, understood, aware of. “The separation I feel from these connections is more akin to being passed over in a pick, as opposed to being picked last: out of the game if you will.” And simply, we have been off that road for a long time.
    <br>&emsp;That idea, of reproach, is perhaps my core feature. For you see, without problems much can be known, and our shackles which regard the former, are much lower than anyone shows. Imagine, if you had a free bed and bread in your belly: could you not survive, would this not be relatively fine? What is the need for a large home, or a vehicle when you consider how those meager needs are acquired? College even, a career in general, we are glued, or ordained towards some precise spot, a post, acting (or listening) as if we must specialize, prioritize and commission our time and objective: for what though, I do not know really. I tend to remove family, or children at least in these regards, for they are not essentially different, and thus what you care for and need, is what you must also foster and provide. Even then, people generally have children together, and considering the efficiency of splitting the pay for what amounts to the same, leaves room for another. “My half plus your half covers the whole. However, instead of having my other half left over, and yours, this is spent on a third member. Being even though, or just covered, seems alright when family is the reward, and of a simply free kind .”
    <br>&emsp;Now I understand the motivation to achieve this scenario with more efficeincy, with more breadth even. But we mustn’t confuse what is comfortable with what is truly worth desiring; for in my mind, we’ve put our foot before the shoe; and reproach is that reasonable attempt to fit them together. Again, were talking about needs, and the mistake we make is working for additions to the needs we have. This is so for we may in fact think the worth is solid, or, in a great deal of ways, we use these accessories as refinements, which, in other words, makes our means more acceptable and pleasing. This is fine, but let’s say for instance, we did agree that a roof and bread was all we needed. It seems preferable that we’d acquire this through flavorable and lighter ends, compared to those which are rough and tasteless. The mightiest of points though, is that getting what we need, which we’ll say is the limit for peace and contentment, is not itself the aim, or objective rather. I cannot describe this so fully, as I have not reflected clearly on the terms; but with some ignorance mind you, I can forwardly say that it is what comes from such freedoms which measures our worth; or, rather, what we are drawn towards and able to oblige in our peace and freedom, is what such things are for.
    <br>&emsp;And so, if you work well to acquire what you need, then your peace should be itself comfortably acquired: but how, with such rest, are you expressing yourself, or living from those free grounds? However you are, this is the ground for liberty, the fruits of freedom. Instead of describing what you might see if such freedom was acquired, let us, as a basic, remove our own ignorance in thinking either A) that more is required for freedom to be achieved, and that B) if we have it(freedom),the efforts for what it provides are in need of energy and focus themselves, thus negating novel benefits from our otherwise effort to soften our duties (or means for freedom) or acquire more. For as it were, freedom is the state where your off your guard and without fear of retreating; where in fact, all that is pleasant in this world opens up to you, and to that you reply. So, having more freedom is like having more money than you need: it gives you only means to acquire that which softens your means, or indulgence, which will simply refer to acquiring more goods and fortune than freedom requires.
    <br>&emsp;At this point we come to the question of quality. For, I cannot immediately say that comforts and pleasure, excitement and exotic anticipations are not worthwhile, I simply cannot. I can say however, following our model, that such things will require effort themselves, beyond what freedom requires, and as such, takes away what could otherwise be allocated towards those treats of liberty, or fruits of freedom rather. In this though, we can consider what is in fact worthwhile. We do this by stating qualities which would mark the highest worth in our results, then analyze our natures to see what we are fitting towards, and then, by assessing other objects, or suiters rather for our potential effort, we can see which ones, upon fitting, yield such qualities in their effects. As a pure example, we are aerobic creatures, and thus a pursuit which leaves us without oxygen is almost definitively inconsistent in what it affords; for perhaps such end held a desire, and gave you pleasure in fact, but then removed your oxygen, and thus congruency with nature (or yours rather). This, as an aim, or value we’ll say does not qualify as a good one. There is the notion of right and wrong compared to the notion of good and bad, but we’ll return to that later.
    <br>&emsp;In summary, there are things which we need, and more or less, our time and attention smelts itself to that which seems fitting. Water calls out to us, by its smell even, as do things taste so we’ll eat it; even our body shivers to keep warm. The thing is, when those forces of nature cede, so are her pleasant hues visible. What those of us in modern times do, is work past the point where this is accessible, hunkering instead for more, or at least relieving how we achieved what we had (with softeners, or comforts). I believe though that we are too impressed and motivated to move ahead, but have little time, and thus experience, of having what is in fact enough. This, again, is a state of reproach, which is perhaps a privileged sort, but one where ambition and fluff hold no regard. And, this itself is a pure way to peace, which is no small comfort itself. But, it is the view that you see and ability to be further drawn, that sparks the motion of your vibrant heart, and calls you to move towards something as opposed to bracing against the conditions laid upon you. When these are met, and rest sinks in, her marvelous sides become exposed, and the joy which comes from such liberty (to see), is worth attending to, and thus, of those higher pleasures and ambitions, reproaching from that.

 <div id="priorities">
    As an early thought, is there worth in going where others may take you, that is, I am wondering if the fruits of our time are there via the hands of others, and whether or not we'd be better off meeting them as to follow their line.
    <br>&emsp;For one, priorities make a scenario what it is, as do oppertunities not litter your way. So possibility has more place for those who are out there, but for what a priority will be claimed. This is a seperate concern though, for we are not talking about the objective course of our live, but rather the tracks which we may take as to find more fortune. I'm not sure really.
    <br>&emsp;The sense that I have is that were missing what others could offer, as though they were going on a trip. The question though does'nt seem to be about whether or not this is true, for surely it aint; or, at least as you'd expect what could happen from such course, that it would be along the lines of activity and priorities, rather than adventure.
    <br>&emsp;In any case, what I would say on this front of delights, is that even if someone were offering there hand, would you go? And part of me says sure, for as travel mates we could still ingrave our way, or remain at least to what we find important. And by the nature of what we'd be doing, so could the logistic crumbiness be overcome. The issue is not what would become our purpose, or at least what the fortune would offer; in this I mean that occasions and what not would be our aim, which admittedly would be fine, and not neccessarily draining to simple ways. Perhaps the question does lie in terms of reproach, as meandering around, and focusing on sights and pleasure at the expense of frugality, does seem to happen. I just can't overlook the offer here, in that it provides highlights, either anticpated or relfected, but a real course of life. For again, going anywhere will permitt possibility and change, but as for what is desirable and pleasing, I don't think the backgrounds of new places would suffice, if they were not in fact the scenery of real activity. "Or what we find dear at least." For if someone asked if I wanted to go diving in Mexico, that is just an activity at hand, and equal at most to our own. So I fret not. Yet if the offer was one of globe trotting, I think that in that trotting I would not be alright. If we had no roots in the harmony between reproach and activity, then perhaps my idle comforts would seek more abundant ones. But of those which come, they seem less appealing. A fortune for sure, but not for me.
    <br>&emsp;Still, when it comes to possibility, you can't help but note the benefit in going somewhere new, being out at least. Yet the problem comes around, as what you would be offered to do is down a path which is contrary to the aspects which you find dear. And those would be finer with a novel backdrop, but that liberty is not ours. What were asking is, beyond our present works and gradual expand, where would the hand of others profit you, or delight you no less. And simply, I think that for the latter there would be too much fluff for the calmer, peacefull look on the world to be enjoyed; better yet, if you removed yourself from that grundge, I'm not sure the fortune would be at hand -for by that givers hand, would you not share, and if not so, not grows? This, to be clear, is that if rigtheous activty and genuine splendor is your treat, then so are crumby activities a drain, however marbled with granduer and comfort. Then, when we think of possibility, we still run into the issue of priority; for whichever one we had, the others would be excluded. And our burden is not of memory, but rather of experience leading to preservation, for these treats are not to be triffled with. Considering the details, ought we defend whats precious against choices which provide poor treatment. Even if the offer was to do more what you seek, who is yeilding you this, and would in such a way? There is truth in this, but still, I would raise the neccesity of bringing what you wish to continue with to the table; for offers of support and conquest would be of what you were when that intrigue was sparked. And so being yourself, or at least reflecting who you are in what you find dear, holds the only course of action for both your natural shine and attraction, and righteous receptivity. "Which the offer of going abroad fails, less it is one of novel autonomy."
    <br>&emsp;On top of that, there is no definite bend to where and when you are, only that you would be some place. And this it seems, holds small regards for someone already with priorities. This, seems the question, or at least dynamic in play. If you have free time, should you focus on what you wish to do and bring it out that way, or should you invest yourself in other affairs as to allow for possible impressions and conseuqence treatment? Either could do. And to be clear, the former stance holds less novelty, as the progress of our civility occurs in mere retrospect, as we are otherwise in diligent immediacy; while the wares of the latter, all be it receptive and aware of some time ahead, meanders a little as that time passes, especially when it is usually by the post of an itinerary, which makes your otherwise prudent resolve a conflicting one. "In other words, if being more social allows for outward benefit, so is it only fair when the suiter, being you, who would recievie is integral to what would be worth advancing, such state could only be describe as one of balanced advanced, as you are neither all the way into the work and thus your youself -still, while progressing- nor are you indebted or obliged to the whims called on by your civil demands (in relief, certainty or remission that is)." And so, in short, the focused and plain life is a simpler one, and more effective one in a given moment, while the outward life which holds integrity is more difficult, as you are by neccessity holding more -and perhaps less full from your less focused expression. Still though, if you fall over this point, or fail to recede enough, your no where.
    <br>&emsp;Personally, I have doubts that being in that outward place would offer any real benefits for how we are sincerely. Nor am I too short on our private position, for if the former is true, and at least if our vision witholds us from being casually social, then the work being done in a time of reproach seems to offer more, at least if it can be constant through solitude. For in each scenario, it seems the bank is on what will benefit you more, or earn you the best. And I feel that its moreso for the oppertunity of dreams and monarchy that the outward life proclaims, while the actual work at hand prefers the time and place, and remission of others, where focus on it can be had; and the furthering completion of that sees how the shine of it will sparkle naturally, requiring little of us, 'as the birds sing, which is pleasing, and the bees begin to churn, encouraging the growth of flowers, which attracts, and all so we may stand, and feel the fruits grow, to which all present are nourished'. For where, I am not sure.

    I seek a friend because in that, we can share responsability. Our body needs regards, as does our family and civil respect; we'll die, become injured or ill, as do the treats of the world and craft require diligence and care; even the tracks of ambition require consistency, the ends of which still hold us from being done, less we become idle. By those counts, we are always in motion, or dealing with something at least. And this warm feeling I get from another, who may understand, is mishapen into this figure of relief and fortune: yet our duty will not go. Nor, to be clear, would the remission of that duty even foster the sincerest of fruits in that fortune. Or at least, if we had no regards for our time, so do our bodies remain; and from that negligence cuts you off from decency and gratitude, which even the wonderous of lands could not make up for.
    <br>&emsp;The truth though is that we will die; our very nature as tissue'd bodies says so, for if they become ill-saturate we cannot hear, see or speak: and such parts of us will surely wither away. Even if this weren't true, we still would have to confer to the ways of other people, for conflict would otherwise ensue. "I am not sure what immortality or non condition would hinder a bullet entering your head; so even if were unlimited, couldn't we still end?" From this spot in which I write, my hands and mind do so in this body I have. And it poops alot, pees, breathes, cowers, frets, shrinks, grows, whines, obtains and so forth. Yet, be it the green you could see or the grip of on your helm, so is the tending of this a requirment. For even if all movements were permitted, so would we need rest. And the truth is that not all lands are for us to step in, nor is any real spot easy to advance to without prioritizing on it.
    <br>&emsp;This notion is a diffiuclt one so let us divulge. Nothing is free for you; even the fortunes you have are made available by the work of others; and so must you commit to access them. Moreso, the roads and borders of the world are not free to travel on or drive. And so if by luck or effort you obtain these means, so will your state in doing so be from your effort. The question then is it worth to prioritize, at least for things outside your home. For one, your home is likely where you will return to. And even if it is not, so are you absent from those who will. Even if this nomadic life is preferable, it is only the backdrop which neccesarily changes. Or in other words the value is in that. Who is to say whether that would be preferable or not; but we can say that it requires great emphasis in your effort to obtain, for you must make your through it as you go. And the point, is that although going somewhere is an interesting way to spend your time, and novelty holds your satisfaction in place, so are you beneath the realm of activity, at least if your intent was to read, study, write, reflect, run, watch or play, so are these in demand of there own efforts, which albeit supported by the comfort that novelty brings, so in there case is discipline required. In practice, the means for the former is not so clean and simple, at least to do so fully. By those accounts you may reach a point where that could be done, but so are you in the same scenario while your at home. That is, you must still be attendtead do if activity is sought for there; nor are the interests of people and fitness short of needed effort. In that, you may throw yourselves into these things, successfully even. But if you then decide to move and travel, how will these things follow? There effort won't lessen its requirement, and accordingly, the priorities of your means to travel will either have compramise those former while these are given emphasis, or you won't be able to do as much as your activities only afford so much effort to travel -and it thus won't be of a lasting kind. It just seems that death, friends, eveness and culture require a constant attention. The difficulty is not the point, only that you would not stop your efforts if the point had been reached -as another will not return. A not unimportant point is that those needs at the back hold no loosening in any scenario. Your leisure may change as will your people, but the constant for death and self regard holds no passing bar; and even if your time is elsewhere granted, so will a negligence of those former make any fortunes fall. And maturity it seems is the acceptance of that fact, and remission of seeking what holds little value while these things are addressed. In other word, the virtues of solidity, reproach, admiration, regularity, steadyness, honesty, integrity, fortitude, eveness, affability, industry, reverence, receptivity and so forth, make way for desires and aversions which are both resptive and congenial to them, but also vibrant and erect from the constant, immediate, natural, gradual, committed and considerate grounds. Which, to be clear, the merest of novelties does not pass by as a thing to be delighted, but to prioritize and highlight, seems short of warranting compramise.
    <br>&emsp;In that case we can say that we are commissioned, to live well and die truly. All, through the measured and amened approach to the rifts and edges of lives lasting play. Virtue and treats run accordingly. And being so, we seek a friend, in that we share such means and gratuity. This is not the care of romance, as that seems more in line to remove negativity; yet, those or more likely than not born from what we are lacking, as compared to what we are naturally born to do. And in that sense, we cannot overcome or avoid our condition, but rather amend, surrender if you will. And seeking others who will do the same seems favorable, yet in it we can have rest while we confirm what we have is already enough, as are we clear and efficient in our own embrace.

 <div id="fortune">
    A strange question, which admittedly brings up this remark about 'really, were not going to get this and that, when will our virtue bring us fortune?', and my statement is simply that the purpose of virtue is, well, unclear. But I can tell that fortune is not so easily come by as it is, and our luck as more in line with our course, which again, could admittedly be what brings you love and coin, but naturally as we destined to be. Virtue though, seems like a neccessary relation, as forgoing suggests that your duty is done, which even if all the fortune was here in the world, of whom would still be employed. In any case, we can speak to the favor and apprecitaion that things offer, nor can we fail to make fair choices to acquire things. But it is not what virtue is for, or our life at least. As the Stoics say, 'we should take what we get with grace, as it may be either taken away or, in some cases, not given: and whether you choose to begrieve this and pursue it, determines if you would otherwise forgo it and keep to virtue and her attendance'. So, again, there is much in this world and a great deal of it is set for us to be. Yet, our efforts should stretch nothing more than whats natural and inherited for this to be so. That is, if you live in 20th century Canada, then respect your liberties, and make honest use of them while you can; but if there taken away, or if your somewhere where theres no chance they'll be given, then appreciate what else you have and fortify yourself against the lacking. It is not in our power to give, nor is it forgotten when we try to, as our sensibility, purity, eveness and health come short of fruition with that depleted hand. But, the point, is that so long as virtue is required, so are we not set on novelties or occasions: or in other words where we can go. For how could you be bored when theres virtue to be had; for, primarily, if it is norushing then so can your attention be grabbed; while, if depleted beyond that, so can the firmness conjured for neccessity be employed towards thought, craft and care.
    <br>&emsp;Which brings up the question, 'what is it for'. As, I feel like our amends are in check, and rightfully so as there plummage has grown to become a world of its own -like were purely fortuned. Yet, I am still overlooking how much we have done, or better said how much room our recent complacency has given us room to grow. Nor are we failing to confuse what would make the consequent struggle remedied. For, as it were, we are disposed to well being, yet in our privilage and immaturty, we squeeze out the previously built up juices. Then, we look for others, or something to allievate the infirmities. But this is so form neglegence; nor was it a mistake, as if there were a point we could reach where new things could be prioritized, as if virtue's neccessity would cease its hold.
    <br>&emsp;As I sit here then, readily I'd add, I am unsure where I should go? Or what I should know, or generally what I should do. First, I would permiit the removal of those degenerate constructs, which is not to speak to the subjects in question, but your view of them. Jen is not a remedy to your suffering: that, be it from and thus consequently from the repair, is virtues place. "For she seems so fine, like all others, in our waining light." She is still there, like those others, yet, I can see as our flame begins to rise, that what we need and how those things are in a favorable way to us, is akin to friendship, that through our virtue and industry they'd share, or accept me at least.
 </div>
 <div id="likeme">
    So defintiively, we are living rationally. That is, we are beyond tradition, which in a way reflects heeding survivability, and going pas the novel customs born from those, and instead configuring ourselves in a way that is actually becoming of the freedom in which our reason's tailored.
    <br>&emsp;Looking for another though, or anything at that, what fits in our reason. In this I don't mean where we should strive, but rather what is in fact privy to our tasks and delight, as opposed to those which require amendmnents themself. The first rule is to dispose yourself and act as if you are free, at least as reason has subjected you. "The point being that we surely have enough, and instead of making more out of what we had to meet our needs, we'll use our ability to only do so much as there is need, but otherwise use our liberty." For what are we striving for if we already have enough. And, in a way, is more discipline for the world required? For she will only give you more of what you already have. Or, she may offer the means to go somewhere, as to relief your idlness through modernity. What I would say, is that we can turn the attention to ourselves, as theism did for the course of our lives. In that, our thoughtfull life is one which details things less evident to comply with. For we all need homes and provision, and growing through that seems acceptable. Only, if the mean of this can be acquired so easily through our developed ways, why not at least appreaciate this and relish the peace; you might even see, so much that your drawn to elective (as comapred to neccessary) industry. Hereby the fruits of virute shower their way. Even if in this I am not disposed, I still won't act like I need more. And admittedly, I won't pretend my need otherwise to do something is not subject to that task of elected action, or at least incorporating the ease in which I've experienced, and letting whats beyond the veil draw me.
    <br>&emsp;Who will live this way, I do not know; for some are still not so peacefull, or well off to ignore those who demand from them otherwise. The question though, is who we really should be, or rather what is our purpose when all our neccessities are owned. I can see how the start of this really incorporates this, as if a roof over your head and bread in your belly wasn't enough, at least for you to recognize this and feel nothing more is but a surplus. What then ought we do. Well, for one, that meeting of survial is really just your tissue coming to fruition, and enacting its mechanisms as to keep itself going. As those needs are met though, adding more is no mans game. Nor, as I see it, is the tradition of elaborating on those elements which seem of survivals eseential; meaning, that we get more and more and find further goods in what otherwise makes what is already enough, either more so, or at least more secure. Yet, as time goes, it appeats that the limit of keeping those needs is not in a lack of what of custom proposes, but recognizing what is enough and abiding to that simply. What I see then, is that if we are left with no needs, or at any rate we are in a state of both safety and fortune, then world around will become seen. "This, as I see it, is the phenemona whereby we stopped worrying about Tigers and turned our eyes to the stars, for our attention was yeiled to the peace at hand, whereby the veil of the world is uncovered, to which that can draw our plans." For, im truth, there is something much different about reaching for or working around to get what is enough, comapred to already having it and being intrigued, as if those subjects were of what delighted us, rather than giving us relief -and incentive to prepare and defend. Other people may try, but it must not be mistaken that compatabilty is based on prominence, but composire rather and comssion. I see this very little in people, even though there is a sparkle of the kind. But there actions are not so. And we are not present or responsible to inspire them. Listen for sure, but where, in their taverns while they drink and yak! Honesty is usually dealt with privately, and we are really talking about furnishing a real effort into our life, so will they on their own amend, and strike upon you. Till then, we are as it seems, gratefull to be liberated from war, illness, poverty, and family trouble for that matter where theres privilage to find, nor is there any short amount of where this freedom can give, be it in books and the world, our own practice and writing, nature and her shades, other passer by's or those of a humored type, or games and other activity which we partake in. Theres so much, and not much could help but furnish this with a better backdrop, or fresh air admittedly.
    <br>&emsp;The question then, is what does this arean of life ask for? If it were food in our belly and a roof over our head, then mere participation in society would do; otherwise, engaging in foraging with others would suffice, or at least doing the best you could do. But what about when this is free and you have the heavens on your mind, whats required?
    <br>&emsp;Well, we must consider that our remedy to the elements is not much different than what is in fact a remedy to our curisoity. For, I would venture, that beyond retreating from severe heat and cold, that our attention really is there to guard us against threats, or at least keep us aware of things which are important. And when whats necccessary has been dealt with, it is not so that our attention goes away, but drifts around to things less pressing. Here is the veil which lifts and stars can be seen, or death recognized. So for me, even though there is a side to this which professes further knowledge, or in other words professes a more distant threat, so are we pleaded by things whose importance is more novel, such as its color and beauty, or grandeur and mystery; even those remarks about death, as if we had room for further regard, is likely when the nature of things itself and all other aspects of this sort come to accompany. And that marks the point, that as we seek more anwsers for things not known, so are things of wonder and delight in need of clarity themselves. For, it is true, that as we question our life and inquire as to what it means, so is that shooting star across the sky an equal mystery. We may have better grounds for defining far of threats, or realities, but so to is their a mark for those things glimmering with their own material difference. In a word, marks are those which reflect either ideas or things, and beyond whats historically been, we can at least say that it is when our attention develops past whats immediate, and we can rest and uncover, be it of further expectations or that of the real world.
    <br>&emsp;In a way, I am in some sense trying to uncover whether I am alright, or at least confirm whether I am in fact safe. "For so far, hell seems but an option of an otherwise weak position, but with nothing else contrarily known, regardless of strenght."
    <br>&emsp;Not to reduce this to a one term model, but our attention really can describe the human part of us. For again, we aren't curious as to why we take our hands away from fire, as our anatomy seems to procurr that. But we act and operate on a timely level, seems to worth knowing. For it seems to have its roots, as I said, in keeping alert and, more or less, set on the immediacy of survival. Yet, through industry and what not, so did we have further things to attend. Only, I don't suspect, as in this case, that there were immediate threats and immediate beauty; or at any rate, that could be the intermediary nature of fun, as if we know that the need of our guard was soon coming. Whereas, upon that liberty to further attend, so were both worries from afar to consider, as well as things of a positive intrigue. And for one, that former has not reached a conclusion, even though what we'd worry about has been removed of any strenght. Still, we do not know everything, and thus nothign is truly known, literally that is. It doesn't cost any sleep though. Nevertheless we still are free, and accordingly intrigued. For our attention remains, as we are in this still seepd in the oldest condition, merely with a near effortless grasp -or efficienct one at least. So, our fun is comparably present as those moment prior, only the intermission is not so subject to some expected dire moment. But rather, our life is quite meager and plain as we hold our roof and bread under our control, all till the resting portion of death. The roots of this may not be dug deep enough though, for why do we even have intention, why is their intrigure or curisoity, near sighted or not. "For instance, why do lion cubs play with eachother, or any baby for that matter who sniffs things and clambers around, finding out." All I can say is under that statement, or nature at least, while the condition remains, so are we uncompressed in our placement of it. And as such, our stretch of time, or at least thinness around that which were required to do, affords a lightness that proccurs broader curisoities and interests. Again, this is where stars are noticed, or moutains, the sun. And as it happened, these things were subjected to our reverence, be it stonehenge, Mobepi Tepay, or the Great Pyramids. These are what hold our attention, which we may simply say is a measure of us, that being attention holding creatures. And as our guard is down and the colors of life truly shine in, our equal amendment to possible danger and threats forges itself to those inputs of color. In a way, if a stick breaks we seek clarity, just as our idea of the Sun, or an idea even, draws more than just awe, but a need to define and profress, to know. Then, the response is one of relief, or at least action of a ceding or fleeting kind. And our mark of the sun draws a similar response, in that we treat it as we would all other impressions, differing only in the one we have. Weirdly though, there is a point to consider that the reason, for instance, that we built the pyramids, was not because we knew what Orion was but wanted to tribtue it, but as to color in our own input, as a figure that represented our notice of it. "As if stonehenge was there for us to arrange our thoughts (through industry) so that our understanding could literally be cemented."
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps our attentive nature is a liberty of its own, and we are in fact reactive animals, whose attention being helmed by us offers that lower body relief when the things we notice are dealt with. Were friends perhaps, as our body being in distress ruins our mentality. This is akin to anxiousness, that we sometimes only perceive threats, yet there from an imprisoned sort. In that, if the twig breaks, then we confirm what it is; and if it is a threat our body is pleased to move, and otherwise pleased to rest if its nothing. And because nothing so far off and colorfull is clear to cause us misery, we have no pressure to clarify it for preservation sake. Yet, we are drawn, like a moth to the flame. Maybe then, in fact, we seek not and will not know, but are rather fine to point.
 </div>
 <div id="obstacle">
    So I can see it, the pressure, or the impetus at least. "Your struggle marks the way, or the obstacle rather," as Aurelius says. Weirdly though, this thought comes from a man with nothing, and in a way, marks the fact that he is struggling under that scenario, but more or less sprouting through it. And I suspect that as he does, the part of him that is behind begins to solidify, which in effect allows him to stand from higher grounds -whereby the obstacle begins to tilt downwards.
    <br>&emsp;Now, I have a clear remark about this, but must get sidetracked as I ask the pointing question: what is the right obstacle? If you want drugs, money or sex, is the impetus to that the real mark of your way? Perhaps, and I would say that honesty comes into question as does wisdom, but generally I would say, for practicality's sake, that the purpose of the suggestion becomes qualified when you ask the question; and such a prompt does not come during your struggle, but after its completed, and doing so further seems futile. The moral is moreso one of constance, as opposed to an indicator.
    <br>&emsp;There is no obstacle, though, I can reflect the ill-integrity to this, for I in fact feel pressed away from what would be rest, or joy consequently. For me then, our responsibility keeps this prompt in question, as I otherwise seek for remedies and relief. "Your duty is the way, for doing breathes security and the according means for life." Then, as if idleness were checking in, you define those things which draw you so that their prompt is easier to see and align. Moreover, and perhaps to the point, that even if your 'responsibility' is over, realize that it is really not, for you must eat, and that is better to do so well; as do you have a family, who may frustrate you if you don't appropriate your spot on the roster; nor is your death to be overlooked, for without definition or understanding, life will feel small and or frightening; and otherwise, you may feel pushed to go live as you please, but find nothing but airy weaving and indulgence's hand. Doing these, which I would say is ever-present, breathes a forever deep and forward life into you, whereby the virtues of liberty come into your submission, and the treats of this world draw you to play.
 </div>
 <div id="delights">
    I recognize that I don't have any friends. But I am more keen on knowing what we need to be happy. For as I mentioned, my delights are those where you can throw yourself in: and to objects of fair obsession. Moreover, is friendship formed around when you share this in common. Just going somewhere, doing something, and of a right sort, is where friendship is bound.
    <br>&emsp;What I can attest to though is that what these things were as we grew, fell off of my interests, ie. drinking, partying, getting together to yak. This did not and still does not intrigue me. And as it were, whereas when we were young and had plenty besides our infatutions, at least enough to not have them linger, when we grew up so was there less for us to do, as were we more infatuated. This seems to me why were feeling this way, for there are all these untreated emotions; the difference being, that whereas before we had nothing, now we have alot. Only, this lane has less overlap with other people's, and so I am still drawn to other's. "In part because there is something more exciting; or, better yet, we have more appropriate means to converse with them." What I would say though, and perhaps its me confusing their interest with their permission of me being so loving, is that I over-estimate said interest in me, then hunger after them. But still, there is nothing which I wish to offer them in time, but rather I think they are interested; and weridly this is both exciting and appaling, for my loins over-exagerte our intent, and our otherwise presumption that their into me, leaves me worried, and in need of anwsering. I always go up to them, and they don't respond, they never did like me. I think part of the problem is that, at least till I could talk with them, I felt no reason to bolster myself to do so, for their interest wasn't really mine; and that because there were rules to follow, I did not see them as objects which I could just play with: either respect them, or go where your enthralled with interest, and viable. Now, we have the cordiality to 'play with them', yet, again, our submission, and otherwise ignorance to what I can actually can, we think that they want either more of this conversation, or something further. In fact, my biggest strain is always under the knoweldge that all we seek is more conversation, but we barely see that person. And, personally, I see a rule that says you will not entice them or excite them to spend time doing so. The anwser though, seems to be if we are more or less togther (often), then so will that conversation bring us into a real relation, of value and our real person. This is hard though, as everyone is spread all over the place. In fact, the common route for us to gather, or see eachother that is, is by going out for drinks and food, or coming over to another's home for the same. Getting coffee isn't a regular thing. Nor are you elsewhere invited. For, even if a unique scenario comes up, if you hadn't been seeing them reguarly, then you wont be considered.
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps, at the end of the day, I live a life of sincerity. I care only for what I can throw myself into, I appreicate the rules and only so much as they are needed to faciliate that, nothing more. And what I have done, for reasons I am sure can be known, is that, in being so alone in our sincerity, we overly connect with those who, like a stain, get my sincerity rubbed all over them; yet, in that, they seem like their newly collected, like their interest and aims don't reflect that, yet, for at least, there electric. And in that I assume that their no longer in hiding, and that we can be together as we try and be ourselves, which, again, has no real place. For the sake of it, say they are under my influence: it is wrong to presume, or consider, that they are somehow enlightened or changed, and that this new persona or state is what they wan't now, making you the prime suiter. "Because your so important, or specail rather in being so." And perhaps you are, but surely not for them.
    <br>&emsp;Our symptoms then are in believing this to be true; and in fact, our incompletness to our other way, is in fact what makes you so, for you want someone on your side. Weirdly, we never have an issue with avoiding there side; except, when we realize that they don't want us, and our interest is pulled in their direction; which itself is procurred by sensual excitmenet, whereby we think of them, undress them, feel known and bethorded by them: and when they tell me otherwise, I feel comepltely seperate: for our interests no longer have their prevalence, or at least their value is shot when our loined excitment is squashed. We feel depressed, then linger after them, worried about where they go, and if they'd think of me, and pass an invitation.
    <br>&emsp;So the lesson is don't keep doing this. For if you do, you can hopefully understand what is elsewhere precious and continue towards that. You have the means to be forward, but perhaps settle where your inhibitions let you; for if you think that Jen is here and wants to fuck you, your ill minded. Asking her for coffee though, is nice, but please come from a spot which isn't prefaced with her having an interest, or you being so smited. Positivity will win the day, but your wound is swelling. So let it heal by not furrying it up, nor should you feel abanodoned: and otherwise as you think of your better selfs excitemnt, it is really just to talk; and let your loss remind you what is enough, don't fight it, and your really heading will open up. For it is not the case that who Jen is and where she'll go is your abscence, but rather the embellishment that she wanted to be where you were, and she does not. Fret no more then if she is unavailable, for do you really need coffee? Besides, there isn't something special, so we'll go when we can. And if your a skinny, poor loser who lives with his mom and dad, the cheer on your heart and peace in your mind marks your own development, whereas she will what, not want to get coffee: for what else would she not want to do? For what you'd prefer she did, she never wanted to, nor what she would, you still do not. As a person though who's a friend of our family, she is at least worthwhile for that.
 </div>
 <div id="still">
    I figure that our lack of direction, or movement at least, is what causes me to feel seperate and insecure regarding other people. For even if their just going out, and generally their lives have more substantial things beyond that, I feel comaprably still. The lesson, or insight rather, is that we are fine to go our own way; and as it were, our comparison to their lives is due to our emotions getting so involved. Admittedly we have less going on, or at least our bounds are quite short in terms of community and people; and so when our foot is off the pedal, we seem rather still. Moreover, we have been somewhat drawn to others, though our plainer pace of life is not so apparently conducive towards them.
    <br>&emsp;We just need to focus on our own motions, be it about writing, church and friends, or our own living and care. This will round us out, and leave us with less attachment, shortness of size, or care even for we will have both a direction and love of our own. Reason does remove the falsity and pretense of other people, but our impetus is one of lacking, which itself comes from our being afraid -and contriving a poor resolve as to mend it. But we can be more open, and embrace our discomfort, again, whether that is in showing up for churhc, talking about games, learning about and submitting essays and proposals, and otherwise sinking into our own lives, marrying it to the truth found in reason, but wholesomey and fairly, whereby our output is less grinding and (dishonestly) aimed.
    <br>&emsp;Quickly, I will reiterate, or clarify a new found model. The cogs of it center on ones ability to thrive alone, in that they helm themselves with principal and liberty, and thereby earn the treats of joy and constancy, alongsid feeling present and gratefull to the world and nature around. Why is this plausible? For, in our testament, we have no dear friends, nor real intamcy, nor money and its sparkling future? How could we be happy, rich and free? Well, it leans on those named aspects; yet, the reality is, that although their is a genuine worth to doing so, the more you are out of line the less you will be pleased with your direction. Especially when you consider the line of maturity, and how becoming more acquainted with it ever close, leaves the minor shortcomings as stark and noticeble differences. "For it is in a way so clear that you are not, as what is, has been more often. And so as the average rises, so do the points beneath feel worse." What I've learned though is that this approach, or station rather into the realm of maturity, need not be reached with strain or insecuirty. For we are neither proving anything, or needing something more than the honest goods procurred by our reason. On that latter, I can remark that we are in fact set and pure regarding death, family, leisure and care; only, we have neglected friendship and community. It is fair to say that our imperfections of those former leave us wishing for the desirable aspects of that latter, but we have mistakenly pressed into those points where were lacking, at the cost of completly forgoing those communal ends. This need not be the case. Our ability to sit and sleep as we do, eat as we choose, care for and be measured, integral and strong, need not be forgone or dismissed as the vector and casing for our duty and time, so why forgo the relations of people, and the warmth that your lackings cause you to seek? For, those imperfections are fair, as our life reflection can show -and its natural virtue of progress. As such, your disposition can be rested on while your head stays up for further learning and refinement; but as it were, be it in negligence or the rightous completion, why not go to church, or do some yoga, just something beyond yourself. You need not worry about the demands, as they are casual and small, nor should you feel afraid of being yourself: the nature of these things in fact welcomes it. Moreso, is there room to meet people, or at least associate with a group and its otherwise regular gatherings. This adds needed, or welcomed strucutre to your life, which itself can ease your path to those personal matters. Adding to that, again, is the point that your current developments and purpose of them, bars you to no reserved degree.
    <br>&emsp;This is nice, exciting to. Admittedly as our principle wanes, or slacks a little, I feel perked up by the potential of such experiences, which is nice, but I am keen to remain somewhat calm and postured about it; for our intent may have our anticipation sparking up due to emotion as opposed to what you have any right to expect. The better approach is to lean into your discomfort, recongize the consistency and participation that your granted from trying, and otherwise be honest and sincere in your communication with whoever is there; in that, you can mold something intimate or friendly, and otherwise sink into the general support that the group brings.

    I am having trouble with Jen. I care for her, in a way that is reminiscent of love. But I am not sure she sees me. Or, if she does, like me, our notice is drifting amidst the otherwise currents of our live, whereby the deepest part of us means to connect, yet theres earth and bone beyond that soul.
    <br>&emsp;In those respects I have a poor taste for her, as she goes here, goes there, and the imagery of her being somewhere other, breaths within me discontent. Moreso, I reckon that others celebrate her, while scorning me. As I see it, this is all down to an immature want for things, perhaps guarded by the past of provisions treated by our parents, and our current wish for me. As it stands, we behave differently, in that we are thoughtfull and without forward action. "Better said we are more staked on well being and its means, than being well off and the required ambition." This is fine, accepted even, and as time has shown, relatively improved in terms of familiarty and reaction -as older periods of my life were in these respects poor. Yet, the problem arises when the whims of our ways seek shelter (so to speak) from a differently natured end. Here we invite the hierarchy to overthrow us. Which is strange, because if there so willing to accept us, why not do so positively. For if I were otherwise and in a way comparable to you, so would the developments of that earn us a reward, or support even. As I find it, there is more of an indifference on offer, albeit lined with general privilage -as well as the liberties which are mine. But nothing else is quite keen to be given, particularly when it comes to furnishing our active aims.
    <br>&emsp;All that being said, our place here is one where we want to have our cake and eat it to. By those accounts, we are missing, and in practice quite seperate from what we love about those tender greens. Consequently, we want Jen, and are begrieved not to pursue this. What I find though is that philosophy has not given up her interest in me, nor have I forgotten what its like to take her hand. Only, my movement is stiffer than its been, and our steps are out of wack. From this, we see less of her, and rather than feel Jen (or whomever) as a accompanying ray, she gleams more significant. Again, theres frustration rooted in desire, as our wishes from Mom and Dad leave them with nothing to but withhold there hand; which in effect draws me into a defense, or at least the feeling like our understanding is in dissaray. This is not fair though, as without our needs (or fear even of not getting what we want), our home would be find, and increasingly too. But as it were, there are roots of mine which poorly mingle with theres, and such seperation causes me, in a way, to be both more berieved by someone other (for we are more distant from our own), but, more importantly, is that when we see that we are not (near her), or even if we are that our amends lean another way, so do we feel retreated from the according reasoning and taste towards that philosophical other. "And the point, is that however server our interest is, that our choice to otherwise prioritize feels unorthodox, unsupported, shamefull, and inferior." Again, though, this comes from us wanting more, and upon recieving less, feeling like we are being opposed. And that has really not occured, or appears to be happening.
 </div>
 <div id="shine">
    Friendship it seems is right at that edge whereby your own stature meets its rise, but no so far as to lean into someone and throw your shine. Nothing should be drenched, for that is no shine but a coloring. Let your vibrance pitch hues more gently, as if upon being tilted barely upwards, you can picture all. Theres just too much for me to be, and not forgo entries and or localles which pitch it down. Nor am I waiting for others to catch up, as if we in our shine have reached a point of completion. Not only is it false in that you will spend yourself away, but, if that were fine I would still argue against, and admitt whats more preferable, in that you no longer shine. There is just something about passion which is best reserved for those lighter colors; for they are more accessible and cover all. While trying to impart deep reds is not for those but whose around us; yet, are they not indebbted themselves, or in of responsability to be near them? How much can you afford, or to give up while your there? Friendship costs nothing, in that it is but a conversion of awareness, but no overlap or leaning on.
    <br>&emsp;What would you and Jen share? Everyone has there specialities, and admittedly all of us our capable of being eachothers friends. There is a cynic in me which rightfully or not says no, as if we couldn't be upfront as to relate purely on that. Perhaps theres a matter of education, in that what you feel is important is easier to share with someone who feels the same. That is why anyone can share about their excitement for school or griecence regarding a job. About our health though or learning, our deepest regrets or intent about our family and friends, our philosophy, the nector of inquiry and nature, where is there room to talk about these things, both in the sense that similarities here hold a sparse domain, nor, do the roots which bring such aims hold normal places as acceptable means for converse. Hell, I won't even sit in a chair.
    <br>&emsp;But that is besides the point; for my place in being incredibly mature is not one of remission, but what my life brings. For I will sit if need be, whether or asked or of neccessity. It is just so that be it from family friends, old ones, work peers or anyone passing by, that none either A) attract me, or encourage much hope that we'd share an aim for repsonability, and similar ones at that, or B) invite me or draw me to spend time with them out of interest or commonality. We may game, but even then, we are not really that close of friends if this is our extent.
    <br>&emsp;I have known Jen some time; and I've always thought that were going to be together -as if were made for eachother. I musn't mistake this as some prophecy though, as she is a person no differnet than me, nor anyone else in the world. Were nothing special, even if circumstance would tie us together. She has always been more ambitous than I, in school and travels. Her parents are a bit of a mess, and I see something bare because of this. Also, I have caught the attention of her ideals (as a vegan), which seem more like meaning for her as opposed to reason. "Why should we care if animals are slaughtered? Is not eating them all your going to do? And if you were, in both the means and reality in which you'd address, are you so familiar?" Still, in saying that, I cannot help but see her as a strong women, similar to what Jess has become. There in there own lifes and minds though, preferable or not. And the reality is that we have our condition, our family, self regard and its friction of friends; nor are we free and exempt from wanting more freedom and privilage, nor are we unsusceptible to find this in larger things, but for a moment, while our own inner attention would breathe a full casting light and respect.
    <br>&emsp;Our problems are not based on abscences but a condition. Like Atlas, the world is not his burden but his duty to respect, as are mine when it comes to nature, family, friends and death. This is where negativity creeps in through our neglagence; and our humility to do so and heed the mere freshness of air, is where the fruits of real living and its nector go. Passion falls too far infront of this, as if we cannot see what lurks behind us due to its overwhelming flame. Neglect falls to far behind, and can cause us to reach further forward; or at least it breathes more night into the fire, making appear more.
    <br>&emsp;And so, wherever Jen goes, she may be impressed by and ordained to passion; but so will she ignore what lurks below; nor will she be present to the humble breadths of those mature fruits -like corn which sinks.
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps that is our claim, not that we wouldn;t address things due to their height, but that we'd pay no attention how we get there. That is for time and learning, and no discipline or action is needed in order to make that happen. "Nor is haste or hulking effort appropriate." Simply, you want to bend; and in reality there is no height in which this cannot be so. However, it is only from maturing that we do so, whereby we surrender and accpet what were given, embrace our abilitites to experience that light, and move forward while collecting more of this pure matter, whereby we then see the whole world covered in light
 </div>
 <div id="dugin">
    Not to speak of maturity, or the point past it at least, but from the beginning, we all have a moat. This we'll say is caused by our natural condition, and how our circumsatance and joinging resolve scurry us through it. Simply, you can tell if someone is dug deep, and whether or not they have cleared it out. "Whereby they'd stand from that far back."
    <br>&emsp;For myself, I have a a somewhat deep that rugged hole, which admittedly I have filled in over the years, and have polished. Jess it seems has her own depths and ruggedness, though I don't know exactly how. In truth, I know little of her insecurities. But, from my obscertaion, she has filled in what she had to, though less polished then me; which is to say taht alhtough she strands from afar, she does so with less grace or simplicity as I do. In effect, she flaunts and sweats a little, as if she is counteracting her inability to be plainly bold.
    <br>&emsp;Justin it would seem has less depth, for I see little regret in his eyes. There are norms for us all, but I am unsure if he is right ot classify beyond a tier 1 childhood. Of interest though, Justin is a bit of a momma's boy, and although never to hurt, is quite a spoiled complainer. By these accounts, he has not seemed to fill in those holes, however minor they are. Colin on the other hand as deep runs down into the crevaces of his soul. I am not sure if his life is ruled by conflict, by I know his dad was quite strict, and his place in the world is perhaps linched between being fairly well looked after and privilige (though I don't mean spoiled, as he is in fact not an abuser of that), and the fact that he is adopted, 'as if his life has no certain reason'. I am unsure how much he has dealth with this. But I can say there is alot of emotions in his heart which bring to feel some importance; yet, in that, his maturing seems to come by doing the opposite, as if his destiny is plain. "I just feel like this are compensations for him being so aware of himself."
    <br>&emsp;Jen has a hard past as I've come to know. I knew little of her dad, but I do that he left when she was young. Then her mom got together with another, married, had another kid, then later (following our acquaintence) split. Jen moved later on, and I hadn't seen her till recently. In my mind, I see someone who has bright ambitions marbled with self respect. Yet, when I communicate with her, there is this air of correction, or snideness -but friendly though. Nor, is she calm in her pride or upright, like she is reaching for someone, and bracing a little as Jess does. What I think, is that Jen is trying to find herself, or establish some meaingfull purpose by her own right. "Her doing so from afar makes it near impossible to consider being present in our own life." My point though, is that I don't think she has done much digging. In general, I suspect her autonomy has been ushered out from a mixture of conflict and distrust. She is bright, willfull, adventurous, and pretty. But I see no one who has found much rest, or at least is brimming from the siutaion she's conjured. What I see, though am fool to feel obliged, is that she wants more securtiy from within. For, what I see, is a stock of experiences which have brought her forth, forged positivity in all that surrounds, but not from within. Dark Matter appears to work this way, that as radiation sheds from ordinary matter, so does dark matter prevent it from imploding. The pull from outside though, or that which makes you enlightened, cannot be so enthralling or sufficient when it feels like theres no ground below. Where am I to contribute here, I do not know. But we are not meant to leave ourselves (whereby we stand from below) to go off with her on her whims; nor are we to mingle with her fainter complexions, and therein help her refill what she has below.
    <br>&emsp;In other words, there is this space between us, and some of us reaach it from below, while others sit infront, unware or unkeen to see or embrace the darkness behind, and instead have their eye on the space infront. On that end though, there is a lot of time which is spent in that centered place; this is while your working, before or right after; when you sleep and before, while your waiting, watching TV, or in short, between occassions or activity. Vacations mean to overflow you with the former, as the whole thing is of the sort; while activity in reality just comes and goes; for how much is there really to do, and of any interesting sort. That is why we seek company, for it is exciting; yet, if your honest, how much of your time really is your own? Moreso, on our end, is that place in front more fair and encompassing, while I suspect that those whos view comes from a place infront has less depth, but is in fact mor concrete, as if they can nearly see it -which in a way spills on you longing and regret, for it seems right there, yet your held back.
    <br>&emsp;A real dissapoint for me is having to impart the truth in the matter. For I realize that Jen must be sad, or at least there must be something missing -which we are not surely the remedy. But, I cannot fret over that, though I can remark our own dishonesty and how that has me less pleased for whichever pleasure they have, but instead having to illustrate their position. As it stands, to be fair, wherever they go, have gone or are going, so are they in that normal state. And this is not so pleasing, as it is always looking for more; and however delighted or excited, it is not really consistent, as without your lacking, and how absent are you from that. Figuring out where we should go really comes from the other side of the spectrum whereby address our place far behind, and how reaching this neutral place of company has no real means to go further. And because of so, even if others are not but a bit far back, so are we outside the realm of possibility. Still, our peace and prospering remains, as do normal occasions bring us together, reguarly perhpas through a post. So at least in those can you mingle in an appropraite way. Yet, for what I do not know. For we are not missing out, as those infront really aren't gaingin. Nor is it our place or reality to expect that they will recede into a layer closer to your own.
 </div>
 <div id="thesea">
    Jen has left. Oh dear how we were excited at the temptation to connect. Yet, we let ourselves get hurried away, because we thought it both possible and pleasing. Now, we are unable to go, for virtue prefers I stay here and live a certain way. And trotting along through even the richest paths hold little dear if were merely passing by. The greatest delight in this world is surrendering your view to it, as to be present with it no matter where you go, and in turn watch its currents blow. "And the constellations, albeit at different points, move not in the sky but orbit our attention as we do, yet in all, there is the same, still in reality, constant in its coming around -relatively." So for me, there is no hill which I could not sit on or read, no sunrise which would't sparkle, no clouds which weren't a dream.
    <br>&emsp;Going somewhere it seems is more about stretching your legs, or finding more purpose, perhaps, in the inherit possability. But for what? To resume your peacefull findings? A course of action is laid for all of us, and beyond what is known and presume to come from afar, bears no hold on how you more near proceed. That former, by reflective accounts, is meant to remove your worry, and in a way soften your occupation to present, as it may seem like nothing is far ahead. But, when I look at what there is, or better put, where I'd be fine to reprieve and naturally grow, theres no pre-requisite for where I'd have to be; which, to the point, holds no axe over my head that we are forgetting something. For what I want, truly, is an open road, a mind to procceed without hinderence; if it is stationary we'll let that be a result of time, but not something we fear; for we may be here or at some point go there, but so will we continue to be part of the stream. "And distractions are those which otherwise pull you away as if there will be something new and wortwhile for excitement." When in fact, even the coziest dusk near the Bengal Sea, would exert nothing different in my, but a then fair and gratefull complexion, to hear the sea, relish the rising moon and stars, and otherwise rest on the grander notion of every clouds faintness, as it lastly lets go of the leaving light. Theres not much more than this: and, declaritively, we will be either honest, and at the very least, not give up. "For who wouldn't want an experience which was worth that of pure content, and our moving hands. Rather than the treatment and miseries of our busy minds." Where do you have to go, what do you have to be? I recall there being a confusion of others seeing merrit besides me, but they'll find their own way. In fact, our place is indifferent, as their greatness is found where and whenever they are. "And we should not feel like were outside of the collection, in that we are not whats needed by them; for whatever it is, so will it be small, but only for the life which is pleasant." Whereby our own needs are small, and we achieve such change accordingly. Pretending though like anything other won't require so much more, makes me averse to being besides that. "theres a lot of work, and little to compensate for the strain, for only more comes, and as such unsettles you into further efforts that let you go. And where is there room for jealousy or melancholy in repeating yourself. Shan't we proceed pleasently, prepping more for what amount's to needing less, where the stream takes us"
 </div>
 <div id="ironheart">
    Here is a quick confession -and do please count this one, that is, as the scale by which prior notes are judged by (for this is what those mean).
    <br>&emsp;Simply, I am a man, but a lonely person. This is so, for I did not what I was told, but what I felt was right. In truth, this post only lacked in a friend, or someone I could share my triumphs and defeats with.
    <br>&emsp;As for women though, their prescence was always one so enticing; so much so in fact, that I have a view of there being women, as opposed to mere people. At any rate, my lonesome heart yearned for people, or at least was struck by them with dear complexity. This, as I see now, was merely a symptom of our wish to return to a normal life, one which held itself together without so much attention; and at the very least had more clear intention. "My own life otherwise, felt like it was always in need of the use of our fingertips."
    <br>&emsp;As it were though, I know that both I was foolish to anticipate these; better yet was it not quite so sincere, and evidently when my wish was thrown away infront of my face, I'd get mad, or at least feel crushed and dissapointed: and for my own sake, this was unacceptable, and for what such people deserved, was something more honestly generous.
    <br>&emsp;Still, I won't pretend like I am the only one out there. Though, I cannot say what a life like that is, for I only know my owm. In fact, a better way to say this, is I only know what a life is like for someone who's life is about a soul person: themselves. Yet, in that conjuring, or self direction rather, there is a poor compensation as the natural tasks and deficiencies cause you to slip. So I do hope you understand why I felt this way; and in a weird way, just know, that for all of you, that considering who I am, that you were the ones who appeared the most strong, and in a sense, could match me: at least you earned my respect.
    <br>&emsp;I know though that in my insincerity, I never did much for you to feel attracted. That insight held a severe point to my growth. Neverthless, I am now receded but onto the world, seeking little, pleased with alot. The impetus though remains, in that what I really want is a normal life. But in that though I have realized that what I truly seek is completion, or some sort of fufillment. The old roads seem to have this lined to the bit; but my course has held to interests and ends that reflect my own: I'm just not clear how to get there. This being the case though, I feel like I am able to be more open with you, or anyone for that matter. As I no longer have anything to hide, for I fear little in what I'd obtain. Seeking little who's purpose is not but a remedy, gives me clarity of the fog which I must bust. Knowing that this problem is there, contents me in asking, for time from you, and attention to myself. For I must confess that the greatest strain on my heart was in knowing that I had somewhere to go, but that adddressing so would make you appear absent. Something about this just hurts, even currently. Knowing though that the reason for that interest- is born from overlooking the real aim of my post, remedies that yearning disparity as our real goal becomes known. We are not missing then what we wish was ours, for the source of our intent has been clenched, 'or clamped if you will'. "Got it!" I find myself saying, "How do I exist in this otherwise modern world?" And again, I forget your neccessity, as I surrender to a task which requires no such amends. I do feel though that ordinary conversations can help, to which I plainly ask. And without remorse mind you, for I feel no loss as you go. I simply think that our gathering could be usefull.
    <div class="qu">So past our novel tinglings and wishes we've grown</div>
 </div>
 <div id="peace">
    Its fair to say that what comes to mind when I think of interests, is born and touted from what we need to do. In that, if we are centered on targets of acquisition, then so will our trouble remain; for not but our discplined efforts can get us there. And weirdly, this is its own sort of task; for in it, your goal is built into the struggle, that you would reach somewhere that is. Whereas in me, my target is based on attention, that having chipped back the layer of neccesity and solidifed myself into our basic floor, we can see that our civil responsabilities are in need of handling, as are our general views of the world and the grasp of ourselves. The difference, is that although doing this yeilds you a peace which is sounder and deeper, so does that open doors, to the world that is. Only, in this case, the draw is not some further acquistion, but a mark of expression, or inquiry that is. For with this veil lifted you are delighted, and accordingly taken. People have this affect, but their draw is one for the sake of heat and warmth. Whereas, our own habition yeilds us an even simmer, satiable and consistent: which upon, exposes us to the fainter objects at a distant, or at least those which would otherwise not reveal their glow.
    <br>&emsp;Worth noting then is that upon this finish, you begin to bow to those peacefull metrics, for not only are they rewarding, but simply pleasing in themself. And doing so bears potentialy harsh waters; for the road here is one of reproach; which itself is nothing idle, which in effect removes confidence or a yearn to some other. Only, reproach is hard, for it is your own to deal with, harder to define, and, in a somewhat positive way, susceptible to those genuine goods revealled to you, for they may in themselves prompt you to lean to far forward. And, in a word, slack is your treatment, and rest can be hard to find.
    <br>&emsp;I think this is mightily uncommon, for I know very few people who aren't subject to the same, and otherwise seeking the same relief. But I cannot consider how folks there are that either know, or at least approach the garmets of peace, albeit those marvelous strands which let themselves down upon doing so.
    <br>&emsp;Its weird, because everypme is tasked with ambition. And because this has the tendency to be more or less consuming, we either tighen grip as to get more of the goods on offer, or we try and escape, for some other source or kind of plunder. This is why there is an upper class, as middle wasn't; or on the flipside, hippies and, in a way, saints, adventurers if you will, going off the path to find some other reason. Only, for me, despite having those latter tendencies, the real things to address were right there infront of me, screaming their prescence and marking their effect from being ignored. That is how I found peace, and continued through the wonderful movements that followed.
    <br>&emsp;For Jen then, she is either moving backwards or forwards, and in either case we can not treat her. For in our case, we have already reproached, then proceeded, and now our objective lines the way. But if she is moving for the sake of acquistion, were irrelevant, nor is our time and path in an otherwise suspended state. We could surely more relate, but even then, that kind of motion is more private. There is no trouble with me proceeding, be towards the front like her, but seperate, or away while she steps back; she may even then see you infront, all sincere. But our task is to reach there, at least our aim is to attest to the interests that come from peace, which itself is rooted in responsabilities constancy. It is nice to meet her and share that were well, for at least then we are verified. But less she were a Goddess, so is there no overlap. That is ok though, and as she goes and we are not remembered, so are with home within, which itself houses the rest of the world, desipte her leaving our attention. The obstacle then is proceeding past this, for you may otherwise be dragged down by expectation, and otherwise whither as your real objectives are feel like there tearing you away from her. Even if she were throwing herself at me, asking me to watch movies and spend all this time, I'd still be best to be true to myself, whereby I would'nt want to watch a movie, nor would I want to have sex or things of the sort. Thats not whats importnat, but rather being ourselves. Relish it with me and we'll be friends. Otherwise, I am making the conscious effort to retain, or at least know that we'll proceed regardless of fortune, with integrity.
 </div>
 <div id="imagine">
    I just have some emtion; for I know that desire breeds fear, as Yoda says, which leads to hate, longing and suffering. We need Jen for some reason, or rather, we welcomed her interest, creeped on her vulnerability, and flattered ourselves in thinking we were deserving and or important in the first place. I don't know where to go though, for I have this chimeric innuendos of her, off being happy, not caring about me, while I sit here and mope. I just don't know; perhaps we have our own reality, and must deal with; but talking too can be nice, which we are trying to accomplish. Still, were overbent with what would obviously be preferable: someone showering you at your feet, of course. Again, you saw this where it was not; and over time this has developed, as it has, into severe dissapointment and longing, which leads to those chimeras. Still, there is this seperation from something which I new wasn't there, where that flattery and selfihsness comes in. No wonder you feel bad when your thoughts are of her leaving; moreso, of those thoughts which are raunchy, so do your grievences and attachment reflect that. "Burning sorts of envy"
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps the obvious anwser here, is that if you see her happy, on her own, far off into her own dreams, theres nothing for you. Yet, this is your wound, for you opened yourself to someone, wisdom being all that could tell you would fail. But you were hopefull, as were you longing, nor were you short of filth. Another aspect of this, is in regards to her struggle, which you may humbly suppose to (more) forecfully illustrate, being left out of this draws her, at the very least away from you, but more likely towards something other. At least, you feel, and again, you are bearing this to be true, prominently at least for you, that so long as she is not trusting you, you are not earning such, or shes trusting elsewhere. This is in fact a core source of our weariness, for we cannot be so happy for her, nor do we find ourselves relevant to her struggle; yet all of this, in terms of her place and prescence, is embellished by us. And it is just not so; for you do not know, nor is it one or the other. You can be proud of what you have and who you are, and attest to where you need not go, along with additionaly repetence.
    <br>&emsp;Lets imagine then, that she is sad, depressed, contained, but that you are not the anwser, without consideration; better yet, someone else is desirable, she can't wait to get back to her real home, and from there the world will bow before her, and she'll go off on adventures, judged as a women of virtue. Or, better yet, she's perfectly fine, right now, and sees you little; sure its nice to talk, but your lame, or at least she has no interest for; moreover, she is looking forward to great things, and this is a mere family predicament. What are you to do?
    <br>&emsp;Well, for one, use reason, which is to say be honest with yourself about this position; for even though it is a position born from your heart and loins, so is any of that which is desired unattainable. If its not happening then, your left as though she was not there, with all jealousy and room for spite. Still, what are you going to do. For she is not staying here, no will there be interest of connection: what about you? I say, for one, that you have your own obligations, or chores rather, in attribbuting your place under death, coomunicating and reciprocating your spot under your mother and father's nose, thinknig about your need for a friend and how a lack of care for reason and its objectives, fairs nothing short of whats average, ambitious or tempatious. This at the very least is required, along with an underlying spring of virtue, in both our deliberation and reflection, remedial spots, stretching, resting and training. "Worth adding is the removal of far off fancies, or, in other words, treating your actual self and all its unwarrantead desires; and at the very least, fortifying yourself against the natural embrace of life, appreciating what home and warmth you have, and otherwise forgoing indulgence and flattery for your own sake: in other words, removing words, ideas, feelings and actions, which are vain, hopeless, foolish, nieve and futile, that is, things which, even upon success, are an expense: which is to say they don't work with or find much room or energy for the steel plating and garnished wonder's of nature its commisery"
    <br>&emsp;What I have to ask, is what do you really want? To begin, I must claim that we have not always been accepted. This means that there was much time before this while our true self was pressing through resistance and the according curfluffery. As we are accepted now and our aims are somewhat sincere, there are all this strings behind me; which itself, suggests we unwind them. So I don't know: my anwser perhaps is 'being myself'. Not out of acceptence, but the strides and colorations that mark that, being vibrantly and splashingly so.
 </div>

 <div id="preoccupied">
    There's this weight, which holds me tight by the throat, judging me, sentecning me to change. This is our view of other people's objective, which is to say that they are clear and we are not. That latter though marks the problem, as our lack of objective is what shrinks our body, thus making it vulnerable to the impression of other people. "Who by the appearence of it, seem not so small." Yet, if you think about, few actually know their objective. For we all indeed amend to the fact that children, family, homes and cars require a career, yet of those aims we never actually ask, or clarify rather, that they are what the means are for. So, we may find meaning in something because it seems substantial, but has the objective really been vetted? For I do not know where I should go, or who I should become, but I know what seems commendable, what I enjoy and prefer, what I'd do over and over again, and, more or less, what defines our route of respect. These are the questions one should ask themselves, and otherwise be measured against in terms of their amendments validity.
    <div class="qu">And I feel strongly that none have done this, and that most are either cluelessly successfull, or equally clueless in their unsuccess -perhaps sulking over their apparent lack, or being complacent</div>
    I just think that even if making an impact is important, that you really haven't thought about what really makes you tick, what you like and enjoy, what speaks to you. These heraldings to the world's problems feel like someone hearing there perril and offering a response, but only because they have no other intention. "Nor are they short of seeing more than they should, as if your lack heeds them to overlook things, or exagerate as to find some focus." Otherwise, it seems like people go off and about, finding themselves by venturing forward or doing things that bring them some life; yet where would they settle? Better yet, if in fact they found what they'd like, would'nt they then be clear about that? In other words, would passivity upon exploration yeild a constancy of what you discovered is preferred. Or would you simply have mor appropraite material to be deliberate about, or at least guide you as to make decisions. But what choices have been really made, besides those laid infront of us. I just can't feel left out or improsoned because were not doing something cool. "These are but mere events in an otherwise aimless calender."
    <br>&emsp;Again, I just don't know what their aim is, be it reduced through our mortality, or specified under our reflection and intent. I just don't know. And the problem for me is, that if I don't know who I am, then others will seem far and ococupied. Yet, if I in fact do while they do not, then still will they seem all over the place, as their whims still feel like there running away from us. Put another way, people come together out of enjoyment and harmony; the former being of interests, or things that eachother likes, while the latter marks similarities in purpose and ambition, or aims rather. It is not easy to see how such an understanding is known, as it seems like people are brought together out of heat and passion before their truth is known. Still, we can reasonably consider that if someone has no objective, then their is no room beside me if mine is in fact known. Nor I to someone more clear if I were lesser.
    <br>&emsp;The reality then is that maturity humbles us away from what strikes is in our youthfull ways. For in these points we have not but room for ambition, as our standing and mind has not really developed in our truest way. Maturity holds us though by showing us that there are more suitable and integral actions than those which speak to our aimless whims. And thus, there is no place or station which will hold much purpose, for these are not what subsantiate our lives. These, at most, are means to bring such purpose out, but those are in need of their own definement. Moreose, it is likely that if you rest more neatly amidst the entire world and its ways, then the furnishings of your sould will be less of luxury or profression, but virtue. And in her wake a spring of delight, cheer, reverence and time comes to fruition, whereby those liberal parts of life become our objective. That is, as we manage our time and selves, so are we peacefully on our toes; accordingly, destinations nor things other draw our interest, but rather our participation of activites that we enjoy. "As I can reflect, as you are drawn that way, almost so by the prescence of your steady hand, you are asked to merely hold that, or cede rather any holdings of going further; for focus requires a cease of pre-occupation. Which is way great music makes you cry."

 <div id="circle">
    The truth is that your are only going to get what your made for. This may be with splinters and scars, but your actions will be what procurr you ends. And priorittizing which require endless devotion in order to recieve the sweetest rewards is so important to remember. Because of course we could do this or expose ourselves to that, and even if that wasn't so bad in itself, for what end are you working for that would itself be good? For where in fact is everyone going? Even those who are fortunate or successfull, are they not so in their own little circle, which even the smallest towns have near a 1000. Why are we fretting over what someone else may have, as if there aren't three billion people with lesser, or at least are focused on their own. In that way, saying how many people definitively makes me feel like we should, as were so different otherwise. Don't mistake the actual figure though for what everyone does, for it is not true that everyone is on their own side successfull. Theres just no shade or relevance for what other people do.
    <br>&emsp;Its just so hard not to feel like we are the other, when this is in fact not true for this no base that we are contrast to. Our circle is Mom, Dad, Dora, Boots, Jess, Nova, Maevis, Carol, Brian and Shawn, Jan, next door and down our street, sunrivers drive and the overall community, Kamloops, the interior, BC, Western Canada, the country, this side of the world, the west, modernity, humanity. And per our time it is wonderfull; but, unfortunately subject to despair as our leniancy must be reprieved. Consequently, it feels like there is much were giving up, and otherwise the goods of our green feel hidden, and theres conflit and apathy in trying for them. There here though, nor are they over there: those priorities are different. Its a success thats not quite different then those ordained for law, in that they must be educated, employed, displciined and consistent, fair and and strong as they mitigate surrounding pleasures and duties. Even this seems respectable, for I do no frankly seek it, but at least there is something truly there. "The thorn in my side is in thinking that if we just went out there or said hello, that we'd be incorporated to a group, or friend, with endless travels and oppertunity." This is so hollow, for even those privilages were there, so are they amidst the rest of the world, so no one cares; but so aren't they absent from everything else you have to do, which makes these whims mere novelties. Or, even if such fortune is for you and your dearest way, so ought that be fortified and embraced, which may in fact run you contrary to the fortunes acquisition, which itself may in practice lessen the enjoyment of those.
    <br>&emsp;We've decieved ourselves though into thinking this is true, and our result is that we've overestimated the worth and our glamor of our friends and lovers around, as have we pinned ourselves against the remission from these -as if reprieve is taking place- and thus our actually treats or expectancy is hiddne. That is in fact the worst part, like were compramising. There isn't anywhere to go, nor do our fanatasies even hold much once there part is placed in the world. And it is there I wish to live, and without concession or hope do I say that where abouts in that localle I don't care, for it is and will be how I choose to, and presently so if virtue is our prize and aim. "Theres just no room to expect that your fortuity and charm will have the time or room to sparkle. That is something which must occur over generations, periods at least, for we must run true and far with it, for if we don't and sleep, there is so much room to step back and thus to return to. That is what I am feeling right now. Though, I will concede that as my head peaks abover water, so does it appear this is where all others wish to go. But forget not that there more likely than not (via that truth) drowning. And you cannot be expected go get them below. Nor should you expect them to rise; only, if while there is a low tide, will they see you acting as if this is the norm, perhaps they'll stay."
    <br>&emsp;Maybe the truth is that I live to far out in the ocean. Its free, easy and pleasing, but there is no oppertunity for us to cross another's path. Even if the lanes here are the same there, at least there would be more underneath. Yet by that, not all is so far away. Yet as our heart stretches our bounds, so do we feel small from longing.
 </div>
 <div id="others">
    We are just by ourself. So much it seems is required to draw other's attention, and being frank, the mere value of having so is that what you find valuable can be seen better, for another sees it. Yet, how is someone really supposed to see what you do, immediately at least. This is why, I think, that what people herald about relationships is when theres an understanding, your known. This is fair and, like a friendship where our aim in life is known, so are we right to miss; but when you think of all other relations, they seem like mere novelties or neccessity, or at any rate based on poor thinking and action. There really isn'y anything beyond what makes us truly happy, fearless and grounded; all that is good is so for it brings that; and others understanding that, on the casual end at least, remarks those truer relationships, in that they are resepctive of your actual worth, while on the other hand, friendship really just remarks an understanding of more serious things.
    <br>&emsp;It is clear from this, as I see it, that my gravest weakness is in wishing that others would be in trouble, directionless, without objectives, so that my own seemed enticing. This seems like it could be true in general, but there is our onw flair of prodigy, in that we almost expect them to favor ours, 'for how nice it must seem'.
    <br>&emsp;I think however, in plain, that we should never ever hurry or deplore someone for having different interests or aims from mine. Nor should you fret if yours are yours alone. "For prodigy, or purity in this case, may be a solo road." Or rather, to be fully understood means you must also bring yourself forth; which in its own right is worth cheering for, as even the barren sight of a soul around does not forgo you the knoweldge that what you bring will be sincerely forth: thus setting up the most rightous of possibilites. Moreose, where actions actually bring may not in fact be to a place which understands you. That may be reserved for yourself, your near family, and perhaps the inspired kind of those writers.
    <br>&emsp;Theres just so much to say, that our furried whims need no more worry, nor repetence at the thought of missing out. For there is this clear aspect to things, which is that when they are defined there is no envy or hate: for what your comparing you know is true. It is only those perceived fantasies which you find yourself negging, for it is in fact quite hard to explain why there wrong while also describing the futility. This is why hearing that someone is a lawyer, father, homeone, middle aged husband, dredds less than, 'did you hear Tom's a lawyer! Its as if theres no room for me to say, or consider, if theres more to that, as if its all glamor and what not. So when I think of someone I like, I fret not where they go for the pure reason that our interests are not in line. Much more importantly is that if our aims are different, then I know that we aren't being spat on while they go to somewhere, far from what I might otherwise think is our apparent nothingness. No, let there be direction for all, but so we can stand by it, rest by, accept is worth and reality as true. The very prescence of these factories is remedial, because it shows that others are either full of shit, or not so contempuous; moreos are we not vying for something with hope, then dissapointed, because we realize both that we actually have an aim, and then settle into what it is. "We can rest and see easily, even those things which would otherwise fluster our tempered mind; for with this aim, and the understanding that it is all everyone has, removes any impression of intrusion and that of pitiful lust." In a word, respect, is for both you and I, for I know that commradery is based on commonality; and at least, if I find mine and you find yours, then their need be no hostility or flaunting, nor repetence from me. "These are my according happineeses, where I oblige and retend. The particulars are their own, but so is there shortcomings or abscence on the road to singularity, where I may in fact share."
 </div>
 <div id="knots">
    It is quite too easy to become mixed up with emotions. Whihc, like your tie to a mother, reflects your tie to others, who like an oasis, speak out as things whihc will rmeedy your struggle. What I would recognize then, is twofold. First, there is the matter of your tustle with love and longing, or at least the mishaps and knots that come with your emotions. The second though, is, upon recognition, addressing the reasons why the source of this 'remedies' are not in fact solid, nor the objects so securing. "At least, on that latter, what you think is fitting for the right state of mind, as compared to one which is grasping, or from a threat mind you, and how things are in this appearence are not in fact so credible, by virute of their glimmer being that of relief, while the truth in them may not be so for how you are in a generous, pleasing state."
    <br>&emsp;In other words, the truth will not surely set you free, as the knots of falsity still seep inside, and spark your curiosity towards things which benefit that. But, recognition can help you see that your swooning grievences and spite are not so for any reason but your need of a remedy, which, in addition, is itself a portion which can aid you in being treated 'as to remove the wound which has you eradically drawn'.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, there is no real connection in these cases, for what you see is an oppertunity; and even the slightest ineraction or response solidifies it as your objective. Unfortunatley you are not likely to recieve what you seek, for nothing true was there to bind you; and so you may obsess and hanger, but only so for your desire is off in its own direction, spreading far from you. This is the source of your jealousy, for every move they make sees you as irrelevant; spite also comes to play, as you feel ignored. Still, you may actually be less ordained to said person, place or thing, for you are more content with yourself. An error can occur though as your ruffled ways (that is, uneven virtue) leads to beleiving that others are interested in you, the source being your own flattery and importance. At any rate though, we can still recognize that it is those responses or interactions that our sensitivty springs on, as either something to move towards, or something which we anticipate coming towards us. It seems better, with being yourself as the right state of mind, that you would neither exepect them or reach for them, but offer, if at the very least to spread and display your interest; this way you may be known, no matter if your heeded. And you need not hanker at the thought of being unheard of, nor do you leave yourself exposes to baseless reception.
    <br>&emsp;From what I see, consequences are from our own misguidnace, or negligence at least. Otherwise, the weather is never quite so extreme, nor is their any element which marks an abscene of law, or goverment for that matter; the ability to feed and house yourselfs, simply, is quite in your control through the most basic of ways; and entertainment and information otherwise, is near and clearly accessible. Roads seem to get in the way sometime, for although they allow you go somewhere, they block, or at least fill, where you might just want to be. Still, the streets are safe for those who know their place, nor is any relevant figure of crime and punishment a concerning one. People are their own point of duty, but listening to them, being kind and thankfull, somewhat polite, and otherwise self-secure and honest, brings no harm or worry, perhaps even a friend.
    <br>&emsp;So I see no need to hanker for things or fret and regret over lost ambition. For we are fine, helmed with liberty and sense, plus the world to heed us. Our time is not but bristening with the contrasts to flattness, nor is our own color and mind too small to enlighten this. There is rot though, which comes from ignoring this reality, and seeping ourselves into one which feels neglected, scarse, impoverished and deserving; such commissery is prone to misery itself, for it must hold itself with outward constance, rather than inner purified strenght. Why this bearing is so prevalent, no matter; but for those not poor enough or strewn about, so is the reproach from such worries a marvelous promise. One must recognize though what the other will bring. For, if you were raised on books, writing, leisure and green activity, then you probally have no burrows and bounds to that life of ambition. In your case, reason continues to be the means for guidance. Whereas, those who are either absent of such a guide, or are mixed in terms of their past, so must we address the likely stretching, or susceptibility at any rate, for you to be on one side, but pulled by the elements of the other: for, as it were, your time in this newer side, or however much in reason, holds the bounds of ambition (so much as it has been present), which not only keeps you from going further down reasons line, but pulls you towards its own side of relief and worry: and what is in need of an address, is when reason outweighs this, yet there is still a nag at your behind, so must we recognize the source for that tearing, being us.
 </div>
 <div id="perfect">
    So we felt that perfection was required, as the words from our hand would run out, as perfect ones that is. And to be fair, I believe that sharpness is required, and have no problems with putting myself all in, 'for as I say, you can never put in enough'. However, beyond the expansion of the ideas themselves, their actual furnishing, or placement rather within our objective regard, holds both a substantial and steady pace. From that, there is room to involved yourself in accessory things, with the aim being one of converse, or possibility at least. Simply, you can ask someone to go out and speak to eachother, or you can ask if they play games. You also, to be clear, can remove your restriction from driving, so much as there are stakes to get work done: for in our wellness and collected pace, were enough. Yoga in the park might just be somewhere to go to, or a drop in, a free class or get-together, even an online chat. You could at least show up, and connect with people. Our communication skills also can, as I said, ask to go do something, or whether or not they play games; and prior to this, our introduction can be simple.
    <br>&emsp;I must admitt though that these bouts are tiring; at least, looking forward to them is a bit exhausting. Really, its just an activity and time, and your invovlement opens you up to the possibility of meeting people. Its up to you.
    <br>&emsp;The oddest thing which has changed is that we are no longer special, or our work. If you want the best of your ideas, then hold yourself accountable; but that is only if you like it, or rather if thats whats important to you. I dont feel like we have some God gifted talent or destiny to bestow, but rather I am close to our past years efforts; but admittedly, our wish to bring them out there, or the pressure to make them into so (as comapred to their loving advance) is out of our wish to impress people, acquire and be seen. This will not happen, as you will still have to go out there. And, in a way, your notoriety can add more heat to your 'general company', as in the case for our neighbours, but otherwise, you will still have to go out there to meet a friend. "Even if there were many waiting for you to show up." And seeing as we could, does that not have an equual stance if their not waiting? At least, in terms of whether going out there is fine, are you not able: even if the possibility is at most there, and you must try?
    <br>&emsp;For I felt that was got me leeched onto Jen, or Holly and Simron for that matter; as I thought that they were just sitting there, primed to welcome our embrace. Yet their not. And the notion was that our prioirities held us from driving and having fun -which we'd do together- so I felt like I was choosing that over them. Still though, such a choice was not the limiting factor. However, if they were viable, or if you did want to try, then being out there would be fine; only, doing so is what brings people together, in which something grows. We would just speak with them from time to time and think that they were drawn. Perhaps women are too much trouble then, or less likely to find; but a man, or friend rather, can become an acquaintance much simpler; and girls will be found and treated similar; only, if your hope is to go further than that, then the amount of effort will be further required.
    <br>&emsp;And maybe that is not what I wish to do. For I do mean to finish our writing, walk through the day, eat well and tend to our leisure and health; but we can jump into the zoom chat: there might be someone from Kamloops there, potentially at least. Or, you can go to yoga at the park, or make more of an effort to take regular classes at the gym; or down at the aeodrome; even the meditation class, all for the sake of getting involved, and otherwise mending yourself out to do others, be it newly or again. These are extensions to your life, and if you try, that their additions can be made. But it is your choice; but still, it is simply your life, as is everyone elses, and unless you try, or put effort in at least, then nothing will happen. And in regards to jealousy, everyone is small in these regards, for work, personal time and family call on us enough, that putting effort in to gorw and maintain relationships, is hard enough, that they are truly thankfull for whichever ones they have. So, obviously they are not going to be into you for something casual, but serious. But fear not that there not comparably small; they only have these mere elements though, which your own effort can find.
 </div>
 <div id="beholden">
    We were too beholden to ourselves to see, that some lighter activity and company would help us destress and or decompress. For, when someone pretty comes by, your afraid to let them go, as if theres this massive burden of rest. I must admitt though that there is a person in question, and that we could not be together is not so clear. Only, and I don't mean you made a mistake, but how little effort, or reason rather to come together, was put in? It wasn't as if you spent time together, or ever had. And the fact that your acquaitence is via family, does not seem to suggest further relations. Nor should it be, for this coming together is only so out of formality. The reflection of me is that we have no other genuine interests or support outside of this, naturally if you would in our own life. So when someone comes by, its as if we've be waiting. And, in these cases, you are asked to stop, so you cant putter on with yourself regardless. Such tings are so much trouble, and consequently, the prescence of that other is overwhelming; moreover, are we tuned to see more from them, born out of insecurity or sensitivity (from our lasting abscence). But again, these meetings are circumstantial, and do not proport much affection. "Were family in that respect." Yet, and again your barren base is the cause of this, your taken by them; not inappropriately, but overly. Addng to that is the frequency of this, as these old emtions cause distress at coming occurences. "As if your going to be weighed down by their prescence, one of which you are more than fond of, hoping."
    <div class="qu">And it is your lack of community and friends, or things to expect for yourself, that cause that burden over rest</div>
    Still, there is this weird aspect, whereby the overweighing feeling of their prescence leads you to think they like you. Perhaps, we recede to far into ourselves, and can not see much past what comes in; so, when were talking and it seems nice, we have no other impression than one of interest. But again, I see it as you, being worn, and asked to leave yourself and catch up. And again, this reveals our external shortcomings, for once our own pressures deflate, so do we collapse. And as it were, outer support and its own prescence in your life, would keep your own elements more ample and lasting (through such idle moments); nor would the pulverizing prescence of one so lovely, and its overbearing weight on one who is asked to stand still, would hold less of an effect if you were A) more ample, and B) more set and ordained to something coming.
    <br>&emsp;Theres this weight you see. When others stop by I feel it, like I have to stop, take of my support and bearings, and sit there, while being pleased mind you. The reason though is hard to describe. Its something to do with overinfatuation. But why is that the case? For I believe that itself is caused by that which makes the weight overbearing. Theres something about me which is quite small. In our hands, it is sound and secure, but when spread out becomes very flat. I cannot say that this makes me want the warmth of others more, or, if what warmth they have, causes cannot be gently handled by me; so I recede even futher, almost stubbornly, or I objectify them, as if doing so will relieve their overwhelming prescence. That is the vector, besides our proclivity. At least, their normal prescence compared to our overhlwming vulnerability, causes such a response in their prescence. Its almost like I cannot stop and briskly pace, but have to bear so much incoming brightness; yet, doing so is not my fortey, as being still while active is a hard thing to do. This isn't rest mind you for even that is forward; but rather, letting things go, being unreserved and postured, but still moving, flailing, galavanting. The thing is, I have no still means. Again, this is due to our lack of anticipation or integration: that I've learned, and I recognize our mistake of thinking so harshly that this was irrelevant and unnaccessible. "Church is thee thing in this regard, for it allows a breezy yet connected experience that asks little of you, but you can be yourself -which is to say somewhat postured, considering the polite and respectfull nature of the siutation."
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps that is the main factor here: why can't you let yourself go a little and have some unadulterated fun? This is not why Jen didn't like you; that can be explained througt our family dynamic, and simply not being part of her life. "Why would she like you when you never see her, or expect it to happen immedaitely." I can say though, that seeing as she is quite composed yet fun, bears down on me in a way which I cannot handle. I understand our legacy and why fun is not important or comfortable; but not doing so, has your best times somewhat worn, as well as susceptible to that overbearing effect from having to particiapte in the civil world. For you must wait in line someimtes, or be at work amidst people, or deal with guests and other people coming by. This is natural, nor are you fortunate to be away from this; moreso, your lack of interest reflects your affibility for such scenarios, as their demand for you to let go a little, runs contrary to your interests; yet, if you could more suitably, then you might actually enjoy their prescnece. And that is why Jen and whomever bear down upon me; for I cannot interact with them so lightly, and being so forward has me (and expecting them to be) interested. Yet, they are not so forward themselves, never. In fact, their just recieving your positive energy. Even if it is funny and content, its not natural to think that this will procuur anything more than a floofy pleasure for that moment; it will not last, it never has, people are together because their part of eachother's lives. And that is why it kills you, for you realize this thing, which out of discomfort you ran at and indulged, is not part of your life, is in fact leaving, and you had been so invovled -by virtue of your concentration, but not duration, which is what procurrs the bond of two humors.

 <div id="slack">
    It seems, in plain terms, that we have ourselves, in strenght that is, while we are with not in terms of something special. Yet, there is the glow from the world of men around, and by that, we are secure enough to give. Otherwise, our self-prevalence has us too sensitive to the glare of others, and our wounds are from either hiding or smothering them. But we need this not, for it is only excitment, which remarks little to what you'll actually be doing. Needing this not and being more disposed to the comforts and freedom around, gives me all I need, whereby I can truly be myself
    <br>&emsp;It seems that the lack of incorporation has me somewhat sequestered from a life which is both open and mature. For, in our solo standing, the thought of another, or at least the remission from that prescence (whereby we are back with ourselves) seems to shut this view and feeling of an entirely open and exicting world, into one which is more common, plain, uneventfull and timely. This is what we amend to generally; and weridly, that strict feeling of confidence and imagery, is only so when we switch from connection to not. Its not actually a feeling I've had concretely, for we genuinely aren't connected. Even then, if we are, its usually that which holds my attention and not the world around. Instead, it seems that our truest, or well formed self, has no real place to go, or at least we havne't; but it is this lens, or person we are in seeing, that views the world in all its entirety, and is open and drawn to there being a scope of happenings. "As if we were looking at the entire map of civ."
    <br>&emsp;There is this slack though, for in our softness, or frivolity, we have little view of much beyond the acitvities of that; whereas if we are stout and upright, then more is seen. Only, in procurring that, we've been quite sheltered, or at least centered on ourselves without either the care or (percevied) courtesty from others. As if now, this reserved nature need not be so to be so astute, or filled at least; but I am noticing, or am just accounting, the clear distinction between what we see when we feel like were known and aware (personally), and that of the opposite, when we are forming ourselves and holding ourselves up.
    <br>&emsp;What strikes me is the ability to try, whereby possibility comes to fruition. It seems like the promise of that can level out our regard for the present, whereby we act as though we're already made; yet I am more disposed to advance our genuine efforts and faculties, which seem less so in there guarentee of success, but pleasing in our attempts, for it lenghtens our hold and fairs of those genuine efforts. "Which otherwise become stiff, or otherwise tightened as we try and squeeze out more meaning."
    <br>&emsp;The point, is that there is no problem, at all, that in accepting this I must be vulnerable, in that being so reserved and defensive is not so neccessary, nor do you need to feel so much longing or attachment; in other words, acting as though there are no issues warrants you letting go, which considering your self bound state, explains our aversion. Moreso, there is a pulling string in front, which says that if you are not ill or misfortuned, then for better things you can try, or at least go where your curisoity and intrigue take you; but again, that takes you past what you were holding onto. "And the limit of this, which is why I say vicotry in two weeks, is letting those vacated molds (where defensese lied) to ease from their swelling, and otherwise incorporate the lighter supports from community and activities around. In that sense, your giving yourself a broader and calmer base of support as to allow your essence to overlfow, or fluff rather: but doing so for the moment feels like a removal"

 <div id="younger">
    When I was younger, I felt no real connection or draw to go out there and explore. Better said, it seemd like we were oppertune to try and succeed, for cool things would follow. These weren't my problems though. Instead our parent's were in heated dispute with me, and finding remission in that was the only aim.
    <br>&emsp;Still, when we did go to school, all that had settled, and we were in fact arranged within our studies. Yet, I recall as that first semester wen't on, I felt so depressed, as if the reason for being there was absent. As it would turn out, I returned a year later, happier, more oriented and focus; admittedly, I did not continue my studies from there, but the difference here being that I choose to, for at least I knew it was not for me, while in the former semester I felt burdened to reproach for I had no reason at all. I think the best way to describe this is in saying that due to our conflicts, and even pass their completion, I could not sit and pretend like the purpose of education was solid. I just had no cheer or claim from what they were presumed to offer. Better yet, that even though it was supposedly good and what you were best to do, I had no convergence with that. For as it happened, I sought refuge in myself, treating myself as if that were the responsability. Quickly this blossomed into a great amount care and self regard, blossoming into a unqiuely precise interest in our studies; moreso did we invent sums, which on its own gave some volume to our otherwise private affair. Not since that early period of adolescence have I turned back. For a few weeks some years later I did make a conscious reproach from being so prudent, but even that failed -and in fact ushered me towards further strenght and simplicity.
    <br>&emsp;It just appears that our moat has been dug up, and from its roots we have no position for tradition, custom, values of the norm, nor any specific interest in how the goods of these come to fruition. Life is simply so I need not, nor am I uninterested in my actual living, which owning a home in the common sense neglects. It holds you from moving, demands so much maintence, and really affords you a mere place to input your cash and build an equity; for sure there is some economy in that, but an frugal life itself more than likely comes out further, while needing less. Moreso, a marriage and child are not things to have, but posts to stand in, a duty, a spot where you must be generous. And by these accounts, having come from afar that is, I can see so much more that both feels required of me, but enticing too. If your responsabiltiy is not enough then you have not given yourself, your life or your values enough time and attention; nor, I suspect, have you even maintained them at their richest position, whereby you'd be subject to the pleasures of that. So if a kid or spouse is something you seek, beyond what would feel significant, but rather you think it would cool and exciting, still rest on the notion that this is neither A) what a child is primarily for, as it rests within your duty, nor B) is it the soul peak of what can be otherwise described as rewarding and enlivening, for of that you would find in the paces and days of self regard and responsability. "Your working hands, your gratefull eye, your cheerful mind and honest candor, affords nothing short of a comparable consistency (to how much your well) in your worldview, wonder of people, appreciation for whats enough and the craft of your hands, all so with zero susceptibility to intrusion or ill fortitude." This, at any rate beyond being pleasurable and worth prioritzing right now, makes those bare aims pre-mature, as for me, personally, 'those normal views and interests seem to come from point which feels like its already done.'
    <br>&emsp;For me at least, so much as I would assess at least, in those younger years it seemed like we'd barely started. In fact, it wasn't for most of that time that I saw anything further, nor did I have anything more than the blossoming of that as I brought said newly formed self into the world. Even that though sparked little development, as so much as I wanted to be relieved and enlivened, I still had our inner task at hand. As years went by I read a book by Epictetus, called the Discourses, whereby the actual aim of eveneness, formidity and grace, formed more clearly into me, as if it were the objective. Through the year or two that followed I further read the thoughtfull relfections of Descrates, the worldly histroy by Bertrand Russel, then later on the ledger of Montainges dealing with a similar life, and Plutarchs sweet and kind remedies -of real encouragement and honesty. Seneca too had his mortal day. From thereon, the wairs of being inflammed by the passion of others and praise, stirred me out of place sometimes, but with no avail; for as I found, those things needed their own priorities, and I was unwilling to compramise. "By the time we reached 2020, I had addressed the pure fact that our being happy, delighted and free was enough for me, and that we needed no other headings or furnishments." In addition to that, I would remark of a thought I had some two years later, that although our interest did not solidify into career or human approach, so did we have a course, whereby things would certainly pass by: while all we were to do was steadily and with integrity approach. "And such passer bys would either leave me, whilst we remained, or latch on, but to who I really am -which is the worthiest of incorporations."
    <br>&emsp;On a final note, I will attest to the fact that in this homely place we are, but outside of our prior range. You see, the thing which has felt neccessary all these 8 years long is the practice and respect for our duty and selves. Being at ease while our Mom barks out our door, or being able to listen to my Dad without recompence, brings a calm and admirable cheer to my heart and bones. Moreso, I am happy to have embellehsed in our general thought, to not be taken by flat shades of purpose or governence, and rather humble myself as to the ginormous fact of the world. This has been enough. Yet, infront of this composure has sats treats and gratuities that have colored my time with the most dearest of grandeurs and activities. I cannot say how many times the sun has gleemed with the richest of appeals, or the moon being its own rising event. Nor, can I forgot, when in our lonely times and when the sun was so appealling, that if we were to miss its best we'd be so say, yet, in some years prior we learned and were in awe of its replacment, that being the burnt blue sky, nautical dusk as they call it; nor, on the flipside, was I anything short of content in seeing the sparkling red of astronomical dawn. These are just our days! And to be frank it is not just that which brings light, but that which seeps its vibrance. As high, the clouds delight me, especially once I learned of the nature of highlights and shades. "There just so pleasently in their large tuffness, far away or over the moutains." Locally too, the leaves and shrubbery just catch the light, in a way that brings me to the earth comfortably. Even the smell of the nearby sea helps me settle into there being a world out there.
    <br>&emsp;It is not to hard to feel small though, as times of uncomfort or slack can make these broad insights a soucre for dissapointment. Like that leaving sun, you may feel enclosed in your mind and quarters. Moreso, the nature of this lane is one where friendship is at most what you have, and people otherwise are not often nearby. There is one thing though which has helped, and that is from the notion that, 'if you are everywhere then you are nowhere', which we'll describe as someones interest and intent being set on all but where they are, while on the contrary, 'if you are exactly somewhere, then you are everywhere', which we'll describe someone as steady and pure in place, to the ends that their furthest ability to see does not fail in stretching them, or bringing in longed for desires. In a way, this latter state is one of surrender; and consequently, in their content to seize no bounds, they are both more likely to recieve by their greatfull complexion, nor are they in fear or lust to move, by which the whole can be seen. Reflecting on that previous point, where this latter was not the case, I can see how in those early states my wish was to move, especially when we became unsteadied; yet the result was that, because we simply could not, looking at or thinking about such things I yearned for only brought more despair, for I was here and without, but also lacking what I sought.

 <div id="wilds">
    So I've got an interesting idea, or remark we'll say. When I was 10 I was quite happy. Yet, in that moment, I begun to realize that our interests were no longer guided by purity and passion, but with respect to our intentions. This, as it happened, reflected our station to college, whereby we'd go to school, hope to succeed, and find our grown up way.
    <br>&emsp;In my case though, despite doing my fairest to amend, I did not strive, nor exceed. I went to class, used our talents, and, in short, showed up and did what I was told. For in that, we were fine. Initially at first this was especially so for the challenges were lesser, along with the expectations. Once we hit grade 10 though the len's concentrated; nor did our meandering abilities hold the increased scope of late grade school. Our scores began to slip, and what went from an average of As and Bs, turned into Bs and C+. My parents were not so strict, but were keen to hold me with caution. Still, I don't recall and standing issues. Moreover, as the years wen't on, we gained a better grasp on how to do somewhat well, to the point where I got a B in pre-cal and chemistry, socials, science, and sometimes english. So we were fine for the most part, and our course load in grade 12 was small as it was -and we admittedly did a good enough job. At this point though, regards for post-secondary were brought to question. My reply was short, and as it happened, a serious break up had brought me into depression, followed by a series of confrontations with my mom and dad. From the former, I felt so poor as the whole world peeled away; and by the latter, I suspect this was so, that despite having evened out from that former, so had my intent or care for the world run short of educational ambition. This was not critical, or scrutinized for that matter, but my feeling around was that others were leaving me behind. "Even Colin getting his car had me feeling isolated." My point though, as I recall, is that this short change of equity (we had) lelft me feeling helpless, and curbed by being reckless. I can attest to our latter time in the year where our abscences felt harder, yet in this middle portion near the time we graduated, I didn't really care or notice. I had friends and was having fun, and for the most part little demand on me was placed. But smoking, flouting about and wishing my parents were distant, had me neglecting any chance for ambition, nor maintaing (or holding rather) any standard of respect and responsability with my family. What is weird about all of this, is that in my reflections, at least in over an even broader course, I have a principal regret of not going to PMSS, for one, but more seriously and, as it would have been a chance to hold the common angle, I did not go to college starting in my grad year. This could have just been general, and it would have been the right time to get back ahead, join your peers and people on your level, and otherwise form to the common mold. This is not what happened.
    <br>&emsp;Starting in the summer of 2014 I had graduated, and shortly afterwards I was hired for my first serious job. This position was transitioned to a less than preferable role, but there I stayed till the beginning of 2015. The purpose of this job was to keep me sufficient in our 'apparent responsabilities', and otherwise served as what would otherwise be viewed (and judgead) as overly neglegent. There was no issue that we had no spot in college: but we would have a job. I did eventually go to school though: first in that coming winter semester, followed by another in the subsequent winter semester of 2016. These had polar effects on me, as the first showed me that I had no aims, while the latter permitted my deliberate removal. And following this I became quite social, or at least personally settled. I found love, and failed, was employed, but unhappy. I moved out for the first time, changed jobs, and found myself subject the doubts of purpose; not in that I was lacking, but that I could pursue the purpose I had. "As I see it, my aims, no matter how well or not developed, were just to airy and abstract for me to latch on or heed understanding." This resulted in a fairly uncommon stalemate, whereby we were doing all that was asked, but in it I felt nothing. Here though, our beginning lies.
    <br>&emsp;In the land of Metro Vancouver there lived a boy, one who had grown into nothing but himself. As a child he was reminiscent of a real man, glad, cheerfull, a leader, kind. Yet, in his older age where new objectives were set before him, his amendment failed. It is not so that he tried and failed, but that he had no wish to succeed. And as this line of complaceny led him down his growing times, so did the elements present fall between his fingers. He was left out, unkeen to move forward, and had little but to burry inwards, or flounder over an unwanted finish line. At the peak of this though there was someting respectable; for even though his life had faded, and despite having nothing but recklessness, he still committed, to himself. In the fall of 2015 there was a discovery, that if you took two starting numerals and operated them on a repeating number line, so would the sequence repeat. And as he found this a new purpose was discovered, that not only were the self driven amendments worthwhile, but supportive. Having still little room to grow, he decided to return to college, whereby he applied himself and show more diligence. Still, the purpose of this had him begin to wade: but his soul did not fade, and as the admissions for the following semester were open, he decided not to go. Instead, he found a job, met a women, and had his newly worn cleats thrown out. Still, he was a solid forman of cheer, making good impressions at another job, and for the first time feeling unintruded upon. Whether or not he liked it, he would show because he had no choice to, but he also would not for he felt not; and when it was time, he turned in his cap and was ready to go.
    <br>&emsp;The world still felt small to him though, and such confinement had him wishing to go somewhere. Here the story gets tricky, for in his pursuits he found that although being forward and outwardly was beneficial, there wasn't anywhere for his foundations to grow. You see, the world as we see it, is dividied into those who are kids, and those who, upon becoming, grow into adults, who are then asked and quartered into posts (or pre-developments for higher posts) with the aim of acquiring money; and at the very least, work for the sake of running a buisness, feeing a family, housing yourself. These seem like find reasons to stake yourself on some means, for the furnishings evidently are desirable -or neccessary in some case. But Ryan, or the man rather, had little if not no interests in such furnishments; for not only were they in need of their own priorities, but the objectives themselves were not worth sacrificing himself for. For him, the world of physics and philosophy were worth more of an interest; nor were the subjects of everyday writing, leisure and craft short in their desirability. And as it happened, these things required very little; nor were they short of their own required efforts, or without risks from other prioirties compramising efforts. On that account, he took to literary portions of Epictetus, who spoke about living well and sticking to that, regardless of the expense. And, from this origings at least, we can cleanly say that their priorities were ones goverened fro the sake of reason, and such labors were hedged upon their enlightenment and indsutry towards great things.
    <br>&emsp;I have two things to say then. First, is that since we were young when the world fell between our hands, so were we fortuned to have come out on top when our autonomy was its greatest. For if we had broken some years prior, then our point of recovery would still likely have led us to college. This seems fair and pleasent now, but I am not sure if we would have developed a pure and heightened character. I suspect rather, that we would be in a similar position as we found ourselves in the years following, whereby respsonability needed a further stake, or at least a change of one to reflect the interest we had: and my wager is that we would have kept to the former seeing as no other interests would be had, and that through that, an increase progress 'down the corporate ladder' so to speak, would house our meaning and significance. Describing then what path we have and why it is different, is fairly done so in those pre-secondary years; where, as we said, the onest placed on us was to be responsible, but the purpose of it held no other reason than to relive any feeling that we were poor in contrast to others, or that we were letting our parents down. There never was something in particular that I wanted to do; nor did I care, with positivity that is, about retirement, owning a home, or any idea of marriage of sorts. These concepts felt like common furnishings, but held no place as any heart or matter. The point is though, that whereas other people may hit the contrary side of gluttony, we simply were sufficiently amended. "Even though it never felt like our head was above water." And as it was our fortune, so did ceratin events in those later high-school years pull me into a negative tailspin, in part because we had no other forward momentum. Consequently, when we were given chances to move forward, I had to little movement to either feel like, or find it worthwhile. What I feel then was the heart of this course happening, or coming to further be rather, was that sincer we were not keen or endited to the realm of gluttony, we were otherwise left with the nothing of our ways. Like a fire beneath you, something bound us to rise. Coming out of this lethargy and indiffernece, we were curious; and in that came self-respect and a cleanse of indulgence. From here we garnished ourselves as a genuine scholar; and depsite being so idly fundemental, we did discover sums. And for whatever reason, all conflict was depleted, and despite having very few (if not one friend) or any money and vectors for fun, we were convinced, or pleased even, with our efforts and our focus: and I recall quite clearly, that such a time held nothing short of contentment. Moreover, as I'd reflect from this current day, that nothing has ever felt out of sort when we were like that: and is it were, I have grown to accept the elements of such description as being the preferable parts: for in them there is regularity and acceptance. Yet that last portion has been the hardest aspect to constantly come. For we are in this state now, of contentment, and describing it as so is but a mere whiff of our plainest days; most of them, and increasingly this feels to be so, are beyond such evens but of satisfaction to, or joy we'll say. And if we are trying to paint this picture that reflects all those yearly pieces of the puzzle, you must consider the place of each one as a part of that means for contentment, and the opposition which is tradition. For in that, we had expectations, hopes, dreams and aims that reflected both a self importance, and a need for validation. Yet, as time went, so did all those outward glimmers settle, and we instead sunk deep into our soul. As it happens, every millimeter is counted, and, as it happens, like an earthquake even the most minor of changes feels like a mass push. But this has been maturities pace, as the more she grows into you, the more she seeks you being honest. For it was in your accounting that you found her, and slipping in your awareness and attention equally splits her off your side. Consequently though, the years have offered even more refinement, for as months go by and we begin to slip, we install some patchwork and keep our best self going.
    <br>&emsp;As it happens, the course of my life has left me with a reflection. Simply, the practical matter is that you cannot outwardly go; that is, if you feel that 'I finally have, some real cementing, our figure is full in place and we can be sincerely outward', then you've lost your principal style. For who you in sincerity, is not someone with the aims of warmer habition, or glory, touring and fame. We are a man, of that we have interests. But the point worth rising is that this takes both time and committment. For if you let yourself wander into the corporate realm, then your originality will spill out and leave you like most people who really just want a means to establishment. Yet, in that hope for rest, which is to say that you have what it is you need to live, that the real aims and purpose that would come from such rest, are gone, for the actual objective which sought to even you out, washed out any of those liberal purposed: and you conseuqnrly just wish to further grow. And perhaps otherwise, the only thing to keep you in line, is in remembering your interests, and let your problem solving nature glow.

 <div id="bound">
    When you are kids, your bunched up together and find according bonds. Effectively though, a friend is one who you can then do something other, after school perhaps. This is similar as it is in work places, or sports even.
    <br>&emsp;What I find weird is that what you need to do, or at least the rafters of our lives, really dictate the groove of our connecton. For if everyone is working has not much else they'd do but drink and comfort, than those are the strands for you to connect on. Simply, if our buisness is regarding the ease from death, the care for activity over station, and the removal of what something is for -namely the raising of kids- then our mold for overlap is smaller.
    <br>&emsp;It has always been the case that things intrigue. Whether I was with somebody or on my own, I was fairly contented. The difference being that I'd play sports with others, and otherwise bring them to play games and watch televions -which I'd do contendely otherwise by myself. When I got older though, despite remaining content with gaming, the overlap began to shrink outside of anything akin to ball hockey, and had more counts in drinking. This was fine, but of uninterest me. Nor was this an isolated problem, as I knew a fair few people who would not go out and do such things; yet I feel like some of them would hang out, and like children, watch movies and play games.
    <br>&emsp;Perhaps my story is not so sad, for the pressures that sprouted near the edge of childhood forced to see the world as a hostility; and although I cared not to proceed where I could through an amends, I did see it as neccessary, as if we were merely dealing with a threat. By those accounts, I never sank into those groups of people who in fact shared interests, but rather I gazed and criticiazed those 'partier folks'. There was always a part of me that did not like anyone, like they were stupid and I was better with no need of them. But this mere complacency burried me as grade school came to a close; for the weight got heavier, our relative means did not fully stack up, confrontation ensued, and all but being reckless and yearning for yonder was present.
    <br>&emsp;There just was no life in me ever to want to contribute; or at least when it came to the duties I had, I could never see pass what would avoid me the consequences of ignorance; but I did not strive, and as it happened, I failed to connect. I've written about this before, but this was not due to other people shunning me, but rather me putting in no effort. In part, was because I had no keeness for what it was for. I was emberrassed infront of my parents regarding a girl who liked me; I felt inferior in English 10 for having nothing to say (amongst those who did); even hearing someone in grade 11 have a nice plan to learn about being an architect, had me seeing someone (being me) as poor in comparison. Everyone went off, and only those who I knew close remained.
    <br>&emsp;What occured though is that I revelled in the pursuit of happiness. What I cared about were games, reading, sunsets, and what this required was mere self regard and attention. This made me quite happy and collected: though the interest for me to go to college, or have a career even, took time to whither out -or to be accepted that I had no path towards that I mean. This resulted though in a seperation between my two close friendships. In the first, my longest friend was bumming around; he was employed, but smoked alot and had no active interest in him; this was fine, his own being, but I could not take part in it. I told him that we could no longer be together while those aspects were saturated within him, then left. With the other, he had similar cares as I did regarding self improvement (for instance) and we held a secure partnership for the years to follow. As it happened though, the road bent between us, and the our intention and ability had to bear itself towards the normal path or ourselves; he took the utility and strenght he conjured and applied it into a programming profession, while I took further refuge in my heart and soul. Even, as it were, as this divied began to happne, we still were friends for many years, but from a distance. He'd call me out of the blue and we'd talk for hours, sometimes about our according lackings, other times to simply boot up and play a game together. It has been some time since I've heard from him. And although I consider him to be my equal, at least in terms of prioritizing personal attention, he has no purpose or aim. That is for his own discretion though.
    <br>&emsp;So now, as it happens, I really prefer the peace and freshness of happiness, and I hold no regards past inhabiting this. This means that I don't go drinking, nor do I text much, nor do I yearn for gatherings and bantering. An effect though is that there are very few people who cross my path of living. Increasingly has this been the case for passing stranges, who are less present to talk to; nor, has there been ever really, anyone remotely on my level, or in the same space at least. Not even barely, outside of those who had good fitness levels in college. Even that though faciliated little, for I was not simply attending to myself as to further my abilities for the common end, but heralding an aim which was other, or at least a set of priorities which reflected the means for what I sought to do. There's these roots though. And weidly, the rot between them is this discontent at presenting when there is unhappiness: and this genuinely coincides with people visiting. For they want to sit and talk, yet I do that on the floor; nor is it really but an average catch up, and in that I have nothing but solid things to share. "And I hate doing so, so casually." I just don't have many interests, at least I have few moments or occasions worth sharing. My entire day is built on temperence and virtue, and my joys come from industry and going outside. Its not exactly too special, and that makes it draining when someone comes by. Still, I have realized that theres room for us to be more forward; for getting together to talk more literally, is pleasing. I must remember though, that not everyone is either so keen or available. But you can at least take refuge in knowing theres room for connection. Nor do these continous refletions leave me without quainter means of describing our interests. "I must admitt though, that it isn't always ripe within me to share that my soul interest is to be a dancer; and that doing so is simple, and that wherever oppertunity is, I only attest to detail: which as it happens, marks the fact that most things that would reflect my interest, are too tailored towards our money making ends, and not enough of the activity, which leaves me less than enthused to participate or committ."
    <br>&emsp;There just hasn't been enough time whereby we new our freedoms, and could decipher the code of creation. Consequently, there has been much more time through our growing autonomy, where the aims and interests had less solidity to share; and unfortunately, I feel like I've been stained with anathema, whereby I appear uninterested. In many ways thats true, but deep in our core is this wonderfull person: and in that, on occasions, I hope to share. Again though, some people, or in most ways all people in a good chunk of instances, care less about having a serious convo, but prefer rather to relax and laugh instead. "At least in a yackity sense."
    <br>&emsp;I just want everyone to realize that I am ok. For there are times when my own life could be talked about, and about theres too. This is a fair feeling, as it is not either cynical or of abscence. I realize though that not only is this the case, that our life has been different and continues to be so, but that there may be less room than you'd hope to bring your new stability to fruition. For even if I had all the money in the world, and invited someone to be with me on a sincere adventure; only if the elements of that were to their liking would they remain; for they may otherwise not seek to be so reserved and thoughtfull, or collected at least. Nor are they about to leave their own posts, despite your offer. And again, where interests come to mind, so are theres different, in that they clearly have higher ambitions, or responsabilites no less. And temperence is not given much value when compared to outings and comfort. Which again, is fine, for I am merely outside of the doors to that; and I am not seeing if I can come in, but rather if someone wished to come out, and sit outside. They need not come to our lands, nor ought I feel disrespcted or ignored if there time is prefferred indoors; but we can have that interest in mine. For they will sometimes look out the window and see you resting there, which may not excite them, but at least they know your here, desptie being different.

 <div id="approach">
    I suspect that we have a problem. For some reason, intelligence has never prompted me to treat anyone differently, anything special. This is great, for all are your friends, none are you enemeies. There are those who strike you though. And this has always been a nervous debilitation for me. I can love, I am sincere, and am always happy take: but I cannot tell someone how I feel. Part of this is due to our recessed intelligence, whereby the world is our awe, and we are with enough liberty to treat it. As it were, 'I wish I did not like you, for it appears more like a distraction'. Practically though, our feelings never show, and we either avoid them, or feel hindered as we are unfufilled elsewhere. The problem, is that I know that we must approach them, pay attention, offer them something, and hopefully attract. But I don't, I simply don't want to, theres more that treats my eye. And this was simple, and in fact, our natural presentation of this led others over time to flock around me. Yet when I got older and we were short in other's familiarity, this could not happen. I regret not going to Pitt Meadows, but the reasoning was fair; I did not care for those who I had now met, for all I saw in them was this primal attraction; and of those things which aroused our intelligence, there was no room. So I hung out with nerds and what not. Where this really comes to bind is that when we were somewhat pressed out of what I'd prefer and we were set down the line of discipline, the fancy I had for others couldn't be easily ignored. I would think of them, and poorly as other habits dirtied my mind. And still, there was always this defensive positioning I had, like they were stupid, and caring about them was wrong. It just never seemed right. So when someone did like me, for my irreverence, I didn't bite, despite feeling the same. For as it happened, there was no room, or meaning behind me, when it came to what would otherwise seem true and proper.
    <br>&emsp;The difference between this while we were older, is that before when we were young we had few respsonabilities, and a great deal of excitement was there; I was fine to ignore it and attest to those things. "Perhaps I could have invited them over, but the rules were not in mind." No matter, as we got older and those excitements vanished, I felt so preserved to care for them and not some other. During those early years when I was the center, I suspect that when we got older and responsability to our place, that we would expereince the same thing, or over-deliver on what we were suppose to do, and be a leader of sorts. That aspect is unclear, as I am not sure what I was suppose to do. In way, it remarks the fact of our bearing now. For I don't believe that we are subject to ridicule as our predilections hide us away. But what were you to do, in grade 6 had you stayed, or in grade 8 through 11? In a some sense, my recommendations from now, would be to focus on the duties at hand, clear what they were, how to operate them, and their purpose as to limit their extent, then remain and propser in their privilage and profits, for those things which were important. This bogged me for years in my development, for I had no respect or care for the portrait of college, work, our future and retirement on display.
    <br>&emsp;Where I lie though is in a wake of desecration. For I did not priotizie those real goods, and instead I wafted my way amongst the prescribe persistence. I did not strive, nor did I surivive for my benefit; and from that rose depression. For, when I did in fact get a girlfriend, and when, after years of permitting myself to accept our condition, I found the angles of it which I like, my still ill-suited timing -whereby they recieve as little effort, like a real good should- brought me away from them, smearing through and amidst the seperation. From then on, we remodelled, bringing ourselves back to both our aims, and their real means. I admitted years later that despite the needs for these goods, there was still a requirment for me; and by that, I submitted myself to the meagerest of labors, listening to my father, forgiving my mother, and otherwise flourishing with the simple reality of this committment, and using to paint our world with spades.

    Pleasure is not ordinarily something that you are lacking. It be something sweet, or a treat on consumption, but generally you are never in a state where its missing. Similar to sugar though, the craving is there, or at least theres part of you overly saturated with the desire. People, to me, feel the same, in that they offer so much comfort and security, that your experience with this prior to abandonment, feels like a real loss. For we had so much then had so little. People are not objects though, and seeing as the love we have is overflowing and ready to shine, so are we not clear to treatment: particulalry without following the rules.
    <br>&emsp;What I see is that reason, or circumpsection, relieves us from worry or stress. Consequently, we have our own inner glow, and a portrat of reality which is constant, brimming, wonderous and new. Such a scene brings a merriment of cheer and excitment, the ease to settle into what you have, the appreciation of all that inherintly gives you security, so that you can marshel yourself, as if a dance, in taking nature's hand: whereby your movement and steps marks the marvel in your heart, the peace in your bones. Someone by your side would surely improve this, as a one man play is harder than multiple; but looking at the others around, and what lines they have and moves they make, its babble; or at least, they don't see what I see in, and in a way cower under incoming rays. I can help them though, or at least carve out a means and place to experience such awe and grace.
    <br>&emsp;In fact, that is what I am doing. Youtube is a stage like no other, wherbey I've taken my elements, folded them into the according designed, and performed them. Some people have walked by, a small few of them have turned their heads with curiosity. But I, just want to take our steps, and, to be clear, in a true and formal way. Theres something different about singing in the shower, and that on a stage. Even if its a little dump down an alleyway, people are their, listening, no matter if they hear you. And there I stand, putting ourselves out-there, soothing the built up joys and strenght within me.
    <br>&emsp;There is rot though, for although this color in me has come from the draw of life of nature around, so were we once closed off. Moreose, were we absent from these hues and power while privy to another interest: but, while serving that, we were small, frail, a failure. This in fact drove me to simpler recess', whereby minor inquiries surrounded a large internal formatting; even then though, the world spoke out to me, however relatively small. I still was charmed by it, safe, simmering those elements which we now find so dear. I say rot though, because in these middling days, we grew emotional surrounding people and claims, which spoke to me as remedies of our grinding experience. Moreover, I was not so mature and consistent in dirtying our mind and habits. Our long combinded with such filth held me hostage, sometimes bodly, towards comforts and remission of our empty existence. Even when we reproached, the walls were someone shorter, or closed around us, and a combination of our inability to not be overwhelmed and the social pressure to get outside them, burnt those prior ambitions, or lusts to say the least, into our aims and attention. "In other words, our interest in how we were had too little room and sustenance to feel fully stable or comforting; so, we held both a contriving eye on what we would do to move on farther, as well, as a guarentee, or expecation and hope no less, that others would come by and bow at our side."
    <br>&emsp;This did not happen though, for as I see it, we held no longing interest for those grounds of ambition, and accordingly our efforts there punished us as we tried to earn her favors. Girls did not fancy me, directly or following our glaring approach, nor did we make much advancement in glory or praise. As this occured though, we only went further into ourselves; and as this was cemented during the spring of 18, we saw that this was no means, but the way itself, whereby respsonsability would be taken, for the reward of freedom and her gaze. This was hindered though by our rusted nature at the time; and despite having little on our hands, I wanted to throw out the entire platform: and if I am confessing, 'live outside'. This did not work however and I was instead humbled to find more respectable ways to habitate the working world.
    <br>&emsp;This itself is a mighty insight, for it reveals this commisorate nature the way things are. Our needs are few but are there no less. Outside of nobility and elites, you are privy to participate in the work that provides -and they stand on. If it were older times, we may live in a small group, hunting and foraging, convening together. Or, if times were more civil, someone other might farm the food while you have another post, whereby you build goods or offer services: in other words, your a member and user of an economy. This is where things get tricky, for an economy more or less provides food and shelter to all those participating in it; at the very least, the quality of what you get is more than those living in the wilds. "It is worth noting that some people in the former live in shambles, while those in the latter live in well-adapted ways, nonetheless though." Immediately I will strike down a root cause of this problem, for in this economy we are molded to work. Simply, if you have a child, who is a person like you and I, then, at the very least beyond whats special and priviliaged, shelter and food will suffice for you to servive. What I feel happens is that people buckle over to get lucrative spots in the economy, so that they can either have more, or provide more: I simply want to remove the worth of that latter, as what is in itself worth providing, does not require a position that allows you to do it much. Your child is, against nature's odds, born for the same as yourself: and if you are fine with food and shelter, then so will they across time be as well.
    <br>&emsp;my point though, is that although a small amount is needed for someone, a position to acquire this is needed. And such a fact caused me trouble, for life felt boring, distant, and somewhat privy to those old emotions and ambition. I still accepted this though; as those prior committments to virtue and freedom became my aim, so was I carefree and constant in our civil resolve to merely achieve that. Doing so gave me both the confidence I needed, and a regularity of this which furnished our now opened and steady gaze: "Here the stars really opened up to me, as did the sun, moon and clouds; literature also spoke so clearly, along with a deeper mind and fruition for art, gaming and film. Our health exploded, along with the breadth of curious mind. We travelled around the hills and flats, holding that as the body of our country. To the end I hope that lasts."
    <br>&emsp;This was near the spring of 2020 for reference. And as I had become un-intruded by others and more willing to offer my mind (in late 2016) so was this a new era on that. We were a man, apt, calm, heartfelt and with motion. All was near, and pure. What was dear though brought an ugly side, as upon our saturating heart came colorfull products. Speaking with people was done so with so much humor and delight, that I enjoyed it so well. But, life in these ways was not absent of pressure, for normal reasons primarily. From that, people were a draw, as however well angled we were in this simple scenario, it still had bars, and people woudl either A) help remove them, or B) heal me in coping. This did not occur. Despite our emotional appeal, people did not reply. There place was elsewhere, likely to where they either say more promise and personal remedy, or at least those they shared more in common. This overstep has happened several times, once being quite recent. What I mistake, is that others, despite being behind bars, are not so ready or arranged to have them be so small, and otherwise remove them for reaon's sake; instead, their confinement is larger, housing more elaborate means for relief, along with more common means of gratification and comfort. We did not meet this. Moreoso, it was not apparent that this was so; so even if it now makes sense, we still let ourselves become interested, as if we thought they would be also. On top of that was a bit of flattery, or self obsession, whereby, amidst all these normal people and their struggling ways, you had a man in me, and in this civil duress we could thrive beside eachother; yet, I thought we were so special, in not only beleiving that we were ordained for someone seeing as who we are, but that they would be so taken back by that, infatuated from our character and cheer. But their not, nor do they seem set for it. We are just getting off this, for in the time that's followed we've materialzed a course and aim for those things which draw us, turning our respone into an objective. Still, in this we have shared but little, and then overestimated other's interests. And that is quite hard. What I see is that there is that rot that has me with pernicious vulnerabilites; for, even now that we have so much weight and focus from our heart, it is still strung together with knots and failed appeals. Other people seem desirable to me now in ways that, past our interest, seem more welcoming and tuned to exagerate. This is perhaps due to our fear of being hidden, which itself comes being more private as we further prioritize. "Even though our course is accepted, theres still a life which is inspired and contribtues, who's details are unknown and hard to share. As I recede into those, I feel less known and accepted, and thus distant." Although, I must mention the fact that, old fancies really draw this out, as upon their return I suspect were passing an oppertunity by, which has my riling up and contriving a scenario where we can pounce. Yet it never was so, you simply misinterprated. Our mind did embellish though, and their prescence had me thinking, dreaming, somewhat objectiviting; reality is harsh though when you realize that you are neither here to abandon yourself, that they never saw you that way, and that for them to, the former would have to be true: and of all feelings I hate most, is being torn. "For reason hides in her shell a little, as does her glow cower its gaze. Disposition molds me though, as do we understand the extent to which either our fancies or obsession require for us to achieve them: which I will not do, for their or my own sake."

 <div id="sofar">
    So we graduated highschool in June 2014. Soon after we found employment as a car washer, and held that job till the start of next year. From then, we attended our first stretch of college, then worked privately during the back part of the year. Here, we formed sums, a formal love for health and nutrition, and otherwise repelled from normal ambitions and success; though, we did contain some hopes and wishes, of a normal kind mind you, but from our newly sorted selves. In 2016 we returend to college, taking Biology, Calculus, Critical Thinking and Intro to Academic Writing; this went over better than the prior year, but our tenancy was not established. We have since then not returned.
    <br>&emsp;In that spring we worked for a month as a sandpit raker, then switched to painting for that summer. In Septmeber we were hired at Save-On Foods to work in the deli, and we did in fact make sushi. Here we stayed till April of next year, whereby we moved in March to Coquitlam. In June we found a job as a produce associate at Walmart, and stayed there till the summer of next year. After moving twice, in November and February 2018, we had took to philosophy, reading Epictetus' Discourses, and finding a love and content with well-being. Our hope was to live outside as to remove neccessity, but the weather proved difficult. In August of 2018 we moved home, and re-established our way. At first we had begun dabbling in Illustrator, but the career ambition of this fell through. Instead, from the end of that year through the spring of 2019 we began seriously writing, about history formost. This grounded me in our self worth and value. And we were quite confident, feeling good and ready to do something serious; so we choose a personal training program set for the summer. We went there for three months, aced the test, had several interviews, but with no success. Personally, I did not want to follow through with this. Instead of bringing our selves all prepped and true to the table, we had fallen under the load leading up to the course exam, and upon finsihing, we had little energy or enthusiasm. So, with a little more to muster I could have found a job, but our own shortcoming had me back off. "For doing it like every other way, felt unexciting."
    <br>&emsp;During the beginnings of that fall, I spoke with my dad, who told me I had to get a job, period. I was content and happy with our writing and ways, but our place in life had no body or bearing. So, after much protest, I obliged. I got a job as a personal shopper at Superstore, and fell right into its arms, as a job no less. I must admitt though, that working there was a strain on my humility, for I thought myself set for things better, and, admittedly, was trying through the winter to think of or contrive a way out of there. As Covid began in the following spring, I began to settle into our position there, recognizing that despite its labor and small oppertunity, it provided me with the time and freedom to do as I pleased; and we were accepted as feeling so. Through the summer and fall I stayed there, learning about love and repsonsability; I also wrote more formally, though in small bouts.
    <br>&emsp;As the fall came to be though, I felt a hanger to refocus and atttend to our private matters and self. I gave my resignation in October, and have not been back since. Through the winter I was somewhat lazy and feckless, though our thoughts and creativity were of a higher caliber. A serious of vicious fights with my parents had me reassessing where I wanted to go, or at least what I was doing. At this time still, I felt these concerns were superfluous, for I was merely being and writing right now, and I could move out, but to no conclusive end; it was merely about where I was, and no place wouldn't be fine. In the spring though, I choose to move to Vancouver, or nearnly as it would be. In May we placed all our stuff in a house far away. From then till the end summer I did not see my parents, but a single time. In this spot I was electric, or at least confided with the scenery and novelty of it all. As it happened, we became complacent, and as it would seem, resulted due to a lack of purpose. We found wonderfull imagery and went on holy walks, but not so often if I am being honest; and our time otherwise devovled into something comparable to our second house in coquitlam, whereby we were settled and put, yet idle, or at least aimless, leading to a mix of indulgence and impression. While I was there I had the ultimate aim of getting another job at Superstore, just to find some structure (out of neccessity too), but our Mom and Dad asked me to come home while they went on a road trip in Septemebr. This did not happen, but as the tides went, we still came back.
    <br>&emsp;From here my life becomes more than just positive. You see, our earlier years of adolescence saw me without any place in the world, but pleased about our self sufficiency. Even as we went forward, there was all potential. As time went on though, the actual place or ability for us to be ourselves in a proper way was small, or at least I felt cynical about the spots available. Still, we lost this desire to remove all neccessity so we could simply be ourself, and we reporached more inwards, making that the goal. This did not build much outer regard, and our task to be somewhere was present; but we accepted this as so, while growing on the inside; and as that inner glow found reason to be in a laborous place, we were contented. Still, the activity of part time work felt empty, however passive and a support to what I enjoyed. The problem, was that part of me which was so vibrant and alive, had little to color with, or to rather. The nagging feeling behind me in those days was not so much that this work was bad, but that we had no where else to go that would feel more pleasing to contribute towards. In other words, stabiliy we were happy, but our inner self had no meaning: and flourishing felt, outside of quality, small in its substance. As the novel attempt to live in Vancouver came to a close, the idea of being more objective came to play. At first our plan was along the lines of programming, as found some favor in what it would allow me to do; otherwise, the creative effort required for it seemd acceptable, and thus the possibility of finding better work and meaning was accessible. This, although fine in itself, transitioned into our own use of programming, which paired with our sprouting writing at the time, led me to build a website for ourselves. At first it was basic, but began to fill up, eventually reaching a point which was packed with a bounty of essays and prose. I did have this feeling like being online would mean we were exposed, but our site was in no way opitmized, nor of much importance after a while that it would become so. We were learning, sharing with our parents, and the words and ideas themselves began to blossom. In fact, their aspects levelled our committments, giving way to dearly being ourselves. For not only were we pleased with what we were doing, but the rush to go out there or the fear that often caused me to recede within, vanished away as the unproblematic advance of time was established, whereby we could simply be ourselves and let our nature flourish, to whichever end or way. This was quite nice and gave no haste or worry as we focused on ourselves and writing through the summer (of 2021). Mom and had moved to Kamloops in the spring and we to central Vancouver. I can account though for the fact that even though the body of our inner selvles began to grow and we had much to say, the idea of placing presenting this still was held under traditional ideas of success. "There was still this worry about what would happen, and that what we were doing was only fit for a certain lane; yet, to do so, required so much and, fairly so, seemed unimportant to address unless you were throughing yourself entirely in." And I had no impetus to do either, and was fine to let our work gradually expand -and then find more simple routes and ease into a presented formatt. We got a job at superstore, were more sociable and promising (in our elations), and all was generally well. Our objective view from writing really came to fruition in the fall, and although I still had reticent feelings about going somewhere with it, the base was filling, and more or less readying to go where I wished it.
    <br>&emsp;Then my dad got sick, or at least was told he was sicker than he knew. In retrospect there was someone I cared for and the scenario I was in was held a healthy kind of activity; but my mom and dad invited me to come home, which again, was fair as my dad was deemed sick, and my abilities were needed; but as it happened he was in not so dire straits. Still, his life is depleting, despite not being on the edge of a cliff. And as it were, we settled into Kamloops, found comfort in the peace and fresh air, and otherwise grew rich in our leisure and writing, as well as reading and study, exploded in our industry, whereby we made a high tier website for the writing so far (and other ornamentas of my life), along with actually drafting a printing a copy of our writing in the form of a book. so far from the summer of last year (when I had moved to Vancouver, in 2022) I have written 500,000 words, 300 of them being before the print of my book this May, and 200 thousand after (till now). And now we are arranged in the greatest sort of industry, a real display, a far speaking presentation. On youtube we have posted and scheduled a massive batch of battlefield videos (all being in shorts), which, in following, will be headed by the mightestest assortment of writing and study fragments, all voiced through crisp text to voice, and subtitled for an easy listening experience. On top of that, is another edition of our book, which will cut out uneccessary parts from the first, and add the best entries from our summer and fall writing. These will follow our literary treatments, and perhaps be treated similarlry, or be done so in their whole setting (where each essay is kept whole, rather than fragmented). And although I see a similar approach to history and science, or film for that matter, I see an even richer place for our musical pallete, where, to attribute James Cornell, 'songs you like can be assessed and commented on, with a fair amount of time and space to reference them, in audio'. This is where were going, and I am beyond anticpation, but excitment, for I not onyl see what I can and would like to do, but what I'd love to do; and the effort and response to our channel so far brings this oppertunity to light, and thus my cheer.
 </div>

 <div id="further">
    I would define ourselves like this. We wish to move, and do so readily, and often. But, when it comes time to stop, we cannot, and we push ourselves further. This has better outlets though, as doing less through the day comes easy when there's stuff to do outside. But, if we have to host or socialize, it feels like were moving while still, and that is quite deflating. Surrounding this, is the wish for external relief, as if we could purely be ourself, while taking in incoming warmth. This is flawed though, as no one is keen on doing such, nor lacking somewhere more appealing. This is where church comes in, or some other activity; as, you can anticipate going, decompress while your there, in that you can still move despite being of a less severe kind; then, if you must come to a halt for tougher things, you'll be used to rest, or relaxed rather by those more active (or communal) treatments.
    <br>&emsp;And so I recognize our inability to sit still, particularly while social, makes such incidences a threat; and, particularly, we are asked to do these when theres someone we know, such as Jen or a close relative. Otherwise, we are seeking, or have expectations at least, that such person will place their attention on us; and so we feel like there's an opportunity being missed otherwise. Then, when we realize their not, we struggle to show up anyway, for there is never enough to do that a moment of rest doesn't come, yet were without much depth in that, for we have had no attention or relation outside of this. "Our crush seems lingering around."
    <br>&emsp;Cutting to the front, I can see that others think of things they'd like to do, and in general compare and share with others: they then work for the sake of that. I, in contrast, seek more efforts within industry, leisure and craft. This is a purely active lane, though for practical reasons. Whereas those adventures and gatherings cost money and the according priorities, our active time is limited only by our means to be generous. By that, we are always moving, and quite comfortably too, as the world sits peacefully, in its common way that is, while the gentle padders and chatters of man breathe a general solidarity. The world in this way feels earthen and fine. Yet, we have limits in this kind of place, for you can not always do the most; or, at least, you must come to a more casual state of motion. "For I believe that some movement is always required, even in the strictest rest, but the amount of concentration and gruff fluctuates."
    <br>&emsp;Personaly, our life has grown in a way that our focused time has born all prevalence, and our fortunes to novelly (and easily) proceed outside of this have not reached a point where they can sustain our lower efforts. So we wear ourselves out, or feel depressed. The lesson though, or at least to reflect on the mistake I've made, is that I have not found somewhere that I can just be myself, in that the environment is catered to you directly, whereby you can at your leisure throw yourself in. Normally, we have to make up all the time and effort; but again, when were out and able and pleased to do only minor things, so can we feel stalled. Friendship and community can offer this, as church for instance allows someone to go somewhere, unwind and meagerly focus, then return to a more well set and rested place. We do not have this; and the reason is more or less because we felt afraid to be ourselves, and otherwise we hoddled our concentrated efforts with explicity. Consequently, times where we had to rest amidst social customs, or some one familiar stopped by, we felt put off by the fact that being so happily arranged, while still (as converse generally asks) made me feel terrible. Moreover, or at least born from this, is the increased emphasis on other's interest in you. "As if we lived on our private corner, and someone would be enticed to come in." Again, their neither interested or available to do so.
    <br>&emsp;We just have to be more reliable, for our comfort zone and pent up self importance can shue us away from those lighter things, amidst our conviction that someone will want in. "As if were warranting our privacy." When I look at what I need though it is not more things to do, as these, in my view, are excitements that promise comforting rewards for those with higher obligations. "As they cannot see behind, in the lands of peace and reason." We, on the other hand, just need some lighter activities, with the ease and nourishment from being social, communal and or friendly. Yoga in the park is a measure of this, as is church and spiritual open houses. These are present in most communities and can serve as a regular point to refresh and communicate. "Which is why they call them services." I will drive to these, or I will scooter, which itself makes the whole thing wholesome in its pleasure. "Thinking of our time in Vancouver, I can just see how many churches and spiritual gatherings there'll be within our scooter's range; even then, we can still bus, or walk even, for the worth in question." It's just something to have while you continue to be yourself. For although I know that everyone is occupied, and otherwise uninterested in idolizing me, so am I still content with being myself, focused, pure. I just don't need to increase the pressures around that, 'as if to remedy our in fact loneliness, or lack of things to otherwise do'.
    <br>&emsp;This is a mistake: we have been ill forward and unresourceful. There is no need for this, you can take your solid line, and brand it with those communal pleasures, using communication to possibly make a friend: or at least establish the reason for you being there. "Which can lead to more restorative motions, and the peaceful course that comes from, as you earn more to proceed under focus, and without any fear of doing so, but happily as you can: for of those things which are in themselves preferable and lighter, so do you know that they are there." Since, in the end, all I ever sought was something like that. "Which in Jen's case, was only that she'd know I was there"
 </div>
 <div id="noticed">
    Wherever you are, you can see, and wherever there is, you can be. But, in my recollections, I am noticing that as we loose ourselves, so do we notice the seperation between us and those around. These are thoughts to difficult to define perhaps -in our drunken state at least. But I do have a model. It remarks that ancient notion, or knowledge I have at least of Socrates and Diogenese, even Auerlius, and their ability to prosper and thrive in and of themselves. Only, in their time they had to herald their inner ability, for that is what kept them upright. The notion, akin to dark energy and radiation comes into play, whereby the lack of pressure from without, of a direct kind at least, gives less push from yourself, which upon lacking leaves you crippling and imploded.
    <br>&emsp;On a similar note is the fact that our whole life, or adolescence at least, we have been expecting people to cross by and notice me. Through this we sought places where there was more traffic (so to speak); this, was paired with our own sense of shine, and how we just needed to show up to be noticed. There is some truth in this, but clearly, or at least I can admitt, that we were not so present. We invited little or shared much, so none could even see. There is that indifference mind you whereby the treatment you get is from entirety, but so in our shorter ways do we need more from people, or community at least; for in that, we have some outward pressure, which our lighter fashion can dance with. What happened though, is that had little from without, and thus pressured ourselves, or focused at least, on refining the world within it. But this only made us tighter, especially considering our natural imperfections. This is the model at least, and I can point to the fact that we are lacking things from without, that they are not unfair to have or liable to remove yourself in approaching.
    <br>&emsp;I do want to remark on ourselves, for in it I see our ability to be. As it were, it seems favorable to be present and graced with all the world around. I see other people with fears outside of them, but console themselves with closer fortunes and relations. Our mistake is in forgoing ourselves to a perfect tee, but then expecting ourselves to do so, as if gradually; yet, both the accounts were off as were our resoltions, whereby in our state following msitakes, we dug further in. This did not benefit us though, nor was it for a reason worth amending, but fear and dishonesty. At any rate, we would be better off to procceed with decency, and our strain and hobbling in a way worked against that. I understand your roots and the natural fear and wearinss of being outwardly bold, but so is this fine, or a mark of discomfort as opposed to an ill-fit. Moreso, on a general scale, we are welcomed to places where it is more appropriate to be so sound and bold, in church namely or other groups of the sort. This seems enough for me, as we have more room to settle into ourselves without the risk of implosion -or further strain. Doing this to, can invite novel friendships, pleasure and fun, oppertunity even. "The privilage of trying, as you are plump in your constancy and security."
 </div>
 <div id="today">
    So I live with my mother and father, and our relationship is quite good; so much so, that their biggest ask of me is to simply do more, to try and live as though we are without bounds. As it were, I have held to tightly to myself, waring myself out and opening myself up to wrong hopes and wishes. Still, my parents have been supportive, even during our private ways. My sister is nice to me and I to her; in fact we had a genuine conversation recently, and I mean to check in with her -and share whats going on with me. Surrounding me are relatives, though they hardly come by. And although we've just been acquainted, there is the community and warm welcome of Shambhala and the United Church; as well, theres more to come, with the Buddhist Church, Coffee zoom chats, yoga sessions (particularly yin), and other meetups and acitivies that we come across. Overall, these things give me a great resonance of prioritiy, security and cheer. Having such allows me to rest and not feel so idle; in tanget with that, I am able to be myself, for there is that supportive brace (and glow) around, which removes faulty impetus', along with providing rest and recuperation following heavier bouts of effort. "The removal of novel and impassioned remedies is really nice, for not even the sharpest visiter feels like an intrusion." Besides that we have no friends. I have reached out to Justin and Colin, nor am I done fretting through message boards and local groups, but that just might be our end. Still, this is a mark of the moment, for time will go one, be it communal or active based, whereupon you may meet someone; nor will your life over time, be it upon a return to work or some involvment with a group of people your age, will see more oppertunity to make friends then. At least, as it still feels now in less intended places, that trying brings out most of the cheer I need: for I am at any rate a friend to ourselves: and with that being more welcomed and settled, we can consistently proceed.
    <br>&emsp;In terms of where we live, our present home is in Kamloops. Our parents mean to move, but this has no known date. Still, in Kamloops there is church, pleasant views, fair weather, and nice roads and localles to scooter around; also, going to yoga sessions, church or other acitivies via your scooter is really an adventure for the day. Though, this is not so unique to here, as Vancouver has similar if not more localles of this kind. Better said though, that what is good is avaialble in each, only Vancouver has more iterations.
    <br>&emsp;I must admitt that our state is quite poor, though our comfort and warmth from those around me have given me some oblige in being so. I won't fetter too much, but I can remark on our third edition of the book, which upon completion can be shared with Jess (and her friend Nam), maybe Bronte or Shaelin, and perhaps through facebook -so Grandma can see. Also, I am familiarizing ourselves with the road to publishing, which seems to come about through agent relationships. From what I can tell you can submitt a detailed letter, personal and refelctive of you, and then see if someone clicks. Again, it is just nice to try, and although we've more grounds in that former, so is there similar room down the path for essays. And at any rate, our shorts are coming on line nicely, with the writing portion being pretty much ready to go. I can't see much income from this, nor oppertunity in any immedaite sense; but the importance, or fufillment rather, is coming further into fruition, which is nice. Too, merely trying to offer our book and essays offers a similar cheer, as I am not so concerned with what I want from it, but happy and bold enough to try: which in itself, solidifies our freedom to barely need it, which in effect offers us more open and laudible room to recieve what we do need. "And where we are with that, so is there all; and where there is that, we can be."

    When I was younger I was indeed quite cynical. The common attire of people's attitude and ambition fit with me nothing short of not, and I thus became reserved, or reproached rather. In this though I had very few friends, and a trajectory of this which was more often than not decreasing. Still, there was plenty of stature, calm and joy, both in my days -at work or not- over the weeks, and generally over the years that would come.
    <br>&emsp;But as I still find, there is this impetus to retreat, or at least settle into yourselves. There is to be fair merrit in doing so, and much of that strenght which I described came exclusively from this. I must confess though, that I have made a grave mistake. For you see, my solitary life was not one of aimless lethargy, or idle complaining, but a decision, or resolve rather, to live fully and with wholesame care. This never seemed fitting, or at least reflective of other people's interest or time. My error though, was in the belief that there was no room for me to be amongst them in such ways: and unfortunately, the product of that was a place and time both free and pleasnet, but with no one to share it with, or for me to care. "And as it were, by the recent memory which sparked this insight -of my mistake- is in that realization that we have become uneccesarily unknown."
    <br>&emsp;It appears that we have thrown out our ability to exist happily and as I please, within the world of laws and men. We have for so long found that such a realm could not hold me in all my dearest and sincere of ways: but this has been wrong. On top of that, our emtions have revealed the consequent strain of this; for indeed thorughout our solitude we have hoped for and wished for a friend, and been otherwise scorched with bouts of passionat lust: but our hidden discomfort paired with self importance, had me believing that these desires would be passively met, 'as if we were either destined to receive, or striking enough to draw others in'. We forgot, or were nieve at least, to think that they had their own lifes, without room for envy or broad comparions mind you, but still one which would not so casually make you their aim; nor would they be so struck in the first place, for you never offered more than occasional impressions, of a good complexion sure, but nothing of substance or promise, 'beyond the mere benefit of simply being with me'.
    <br>&emsp;Neverthless, I still carry the wounds of this unfuffilled emotions. In any case though, we are making amends, or a change at least; and, almost as soon as we've started, in practice mind you rather than mere intent, we can see the reason why this change had to be done, and the nature of who we are and what we are best to do in such a collected way.
    <br>&emsp;Simply, if we let go of what we want, then we might just get what you need. For the former is in more ways than not bound to those riled emotions; and even if their is something basic to what you seek, so is our ill placed isolation and the common imperfections of us all, a catalyst to inflamming those desires, whereby their sensitivity bends past the mere point of proclivity, but into inappropraite passion -and all its begruding fears of scandals and innuendo. "You become a immoral pirate of the naughtiest sorts." At any rate though, our needs will come when we stop seeking, which in our case at least remarks that admission of retreat, and the consequent resolve to put ourselves out their more; for we may have built in discomforts and 'two left feet' as it were, but so is this a mark of you as opposed to what is wortwhile. And having been to Shambhala and church -and much more to come- I feel an easy breeze of communal warmth and simple expectations. This allows me to be myself without fear, but with filled out edges, which in the past would buckle as our isolation forced us to ware ourselves out. Now, I have more room, or a stretch at least, to become acquainted, ordained and known, which offers a steadier platform to try new things of a professional or friendly sort, and otherwise rest and recupurate as our personal efforts go through their periodic close. And for clarities sake, this point is so by virtue of our remission from overworking -as our loneliness would have us feeling idle as opposed to rested when we did nothing- and otherwise restoring ourselves through lighter activites.
    <br>&emsp;What I see then, in closing, is that having somewhere to go gives me an according place to care for; which itself strenghtens our general ability to learn and see. "As if the lens by which we see the world and all its pleasantries, had a wider and solid base to peer from." From here, I am able to care for and feel cared for by those who were once wrapped up in my lusts and misery. Effectively, communication and commradery brings one together with another, but as a person yourselves, so is their a world to care for. Or in other words, what I seek, or at least what my fullest and soundest self feels cheer by, is an aside to friendship, station and fate, but of our purest kind of leisure, craft and care. The specifics are'nt important, but I merely see this additions to our lives as ones which broaden our gaze, in that we are more relaxed, happy and plump. But our vision and the according industry is the true mark and stature of our heart and hand. "And it is not what those emtions sought which I am now in need of, nor would the subject in question -if it were in fact mine- treat me to anything more than happiness, rightly that is. It is my walk and talk from that pleasant point that is the meaning, even though there is much to be content with and glad in your happy place." Still, the point overall is that in this remission from isolation, or reservation at least and its according acceptence of what we in fact need, I can see more clearly what it is that I wish to give: and the warmth and pleasure on offer and, in effeact, what I can provide, or care for at least, gives me everything I need: for as it were, the limits of our otherwise fortune and all its liberal ways, was that we had no one or any room for that matter to care, and as such we sought for people to be near me so that I had the permitt to retreat. "But now, with the corresponding benefits, I go out there, and find that station of comfort and care outside of our home, but in the community instead, where friends and love can be found, but enough intially to furnish our tastes and deeds as a man -which is why my goal is to try and show up."

    I must say I feel quite well. On the front end the sun gleems a bit brighter, as do the pale hues of the night sky shine more clearly; nor, on the back end, is there as much depravity or grough over seeing such bounds, in that before they would rub up against our inner discontent. That is so, for now we are more integrated, structural and proposed. Not only has this given me room and ease to let my foot (when it is appropriate) of the hammmer, but real desire has more room to settle in, as we are not so tight gripped on our otherwise struggling self.
    <br>&emsp;This is great, and although I see the nature of those inner troubles, I realize that it is from time that we are without satiety, rather than our reasoning. You see, we live in a rational world, which is to say one of economics and seperation. In this, we have learned that there is room to participate and mingle, but so must we remain with ourselves; and happily too, for we are so fortuned to be in such times, and personally privilaged at that. The point, is that in these times where oppertunity can become your driving factor, so can we settle inwards, resting with the actual aim of wellness, and making use of the open road to both attend and materialize; nor, as we said, does this mean we have to be in solitude, for there is church, temple, programs and activities, which positively allow you to involve yourself and rehabilitate (your otherwise liberal loads). And as I said, desire comes about from this, as we are not so begruddged or afraid to admitt our post, and thus we can have aims, attempt things or try at least, and otherwise see what it is we actually seek, 'while before we were afraid to admitt, for we were so exposed of having nothing -and wanting only infurriated that point'.
    <br>&emsp;There is much clarity, and cementing this all around into a more bold yet even approach -and the according elements- is something that time will provide. But right now I can only rest, happily even despite our whithered state. That is one of the benefits of having itinerary, is that you have less pressure to push yourself, and otherwise feel fine with feeling the way you are. As I say, as we are dextrous and bipedal, so are we honest and rational; and these need no license to amend, but rather a firm grip on both their findings and investigative properties. As it were, the marks against yourself reveal themselves in the tiniest (sometimes) of ways, and being more attentive and alert to this will at least expose the symptom as so, by which your reflections can discern the cause: and disposition readily obliges.
    <br>&emsp;Over time then we seem to be on a steady road upwards. For we have always been fine, great even, and much has come to boot because of this. I can illustrate this fact though, that as those better times came about that it was due to us letting go of the world around, and then letting our true actions and intent rise. In this we created our website, naturalized our ways of living, wrote our book amidst a bound of accompanying things. And now, in this most gifted of times and merry ways, I realize that there is nothign which could make me happy, for I already have all, but rather I seek connection, purpose, meaning or activity, and only can this be procurred, anticpated or experienced through our actions, which we are without bounds to attempt. Only, and my point, is that in this fullest way that we've been through the period prior, we were still on record with thinking that such an integral self would grant us corresponding rewards. And as of now we are in the mind of letting that go, for we are no longer confused with the greens of that and of our real soul. In that, as they say, we have everything and are no longer in the buisness of wants, but instead surrendering to what we have and letting our actions reflect such allocations, 'whereby we seem to be recieving what we actually need'. Before we were so bent on getting something from being me, but these things are no longer of worth. Instead, we are full, we are complete, and as if an extension of those liberal portions of our self, we are merely ingratiaing that into our human self, whereby we let go of this desitined post of kings and tycoons, but rather a man, who is happy with himself and content to procceed, but then appropriates himself via industry, trade, friendship and community, with a natural gait. There are still things to define, and seeing more as we do in this peacefull state, warrants more consideration (and definement). How thankfull we should be though, that these items of interest, or at least subjects behind this farthest veil, are marks from our real self coming to terms with its dearest and foremost sought fruition. "I fear not to see all around, for I am in fact prime to proceed, as opposed to hanging on to ourselves and other means in order to grab them: we can merely be."

 <div id="birthday">
    It is my birthday, and I am 28 years old. I can see far ahead the marks of what will result in our expression of becoming a man, and so to those fainter things which until recent, held little regard. We are with not but cheer, and only slowed by our childish infirmities. "Removing such begrudgeries has made me feel most pleasant; and, as other things of the sort have occured similarly, I can tell that there is good amidst me, as although these refurbishments bring with them an uprooting of the filth that was below, so do these thorns and debris brush past me, stinging only on their route out the door; and as per our honest reflection, I know (of those thonrs) I was ceding to the right symptoms, as the stings I began to notice were of those irriations and falliblities which were entering me, as opposed to the current ones and their leave."
    <br>&emsp;Such is the way for someone like this, who like Mr. Hume, means only to live as our mind and liberality choose to. For clarity sake, I will specificy that our present adjustments are such that our place in the world and our time with its inhabitants is gaining a more appropraite standing; but, and to my credit, this is only due to our release of poorly placed, or at least unneccessary reservations, which by my acocunt, were only there from our liberal aims being squeezed into the purpose of fortune and fame. As I have since noted, this hold that I had was understandable, as our literay and crafty character was built out of reproach and remission; but, as it were, we bore little friendship or equity in such positions, nor was there any lack of conflict and criticism, which over time made me helm ourselves with even more decency and constance, but conseuqently with more tightness and obsintnace. At the moment we have relinquiehs such control, for the hopes of those confined quarters no longer speak to me as worthwhile gains; for all the conflict of being me and struggle of doing so well has been surpassed, and we are admittedly free to be, fully. Again, the desires that pressured me from around still lingered, but as of late their hold has lessened as we subcummb to our actual interests innate to the hearts of man. "Forgo what you want, and you may get what you need."
    <br>&emsp;And since being me was all I ever wanted, and that achieving so is both secure and bountifull, we need no further regard for it -as if to prove or releive our confined efforts. This has removed the need for our overly arhacic and or scrutiable restrictions, and in effect has allowed me to be more curious about people and work around, or otherwise move and angle ourselves in a more comfortable and progressing way. I will confess though that such openess to the warmth of solidarity and itinerary shows how little we held prior; and as I had ambitions regarding our sheltered self, so did I have hopes and fancies for women, money and infamy, which now upon being more open, ware at me as they leave. "those dang thorny emotions." Again though, these are fallibiities which are no longer being pressed inwards and inflammed, but are more free to expose themselves and dissipate. Doing so has left me feeling both engaged and in tune with gentle invovlemtns to come, which in combination releives that all to common perfection that I once saw as neccessary; in effect, we are able to restore ourselves, and not ware ourselves thin to begin with; which itself allows for better work when such efforts are fitting, and otherwise for us to enjoy our leisure and craft when those would in fact be prefferred. "Whereas before, being unengaged with some grand or fortuitous task had me feeling idle and defeated: now I can more gently proceed." Worth noting too, is our ease and merry advancements into working fields, or those of social worth. BEcause we aren't afraid, we are both free and measurably eager in becoming acquainted with the processes and path towards publishing, trade-work, and (in that social aspect) online dating. Practically, we learn the tools and properties required, and then construct our actuall view and intent, as if we were deliberating the actual mateiral or content fitting for the prompts in question. "What is our book actually, and what of it do we want to share and say (to the publisher)? What are you actually looking for in a women, who are you to be sought and other things of the sort." Doing this fosters a certain complexion of fair desires, which itself has me anticiapting what is actually sought, while also removing fragmented wishes and fancie'd criticism -whereby you hate yourself for not being what some novel person requires. These sprouts of possibility are our own, and furnish us with a life which is nice in front, and also confiding in that we are the ones advancing it -or trying at least, which, in short, removes any fleeing feelings or regret over having your head pointed to the bottom.
